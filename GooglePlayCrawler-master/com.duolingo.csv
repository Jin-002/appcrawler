"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Recently the speech broke for me. I can no longer do speaking exercise. It just doesn't allow me any time to speak before it jump to complete. It has been happening consistently. Please fix it in future release. Still unfixed, had to leave Duolingo and unsubscribed for the next year. This is really frustrating. after using it for a few years, I won't come back until they fix various bug from Android side. So disappointing."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app for your kids of you want them to improve reading. Great app duolingo! Keep up the great work. Overall assessment: While Duolingo isn't a perfect app, it is one of the best ones out there for learning a language because it's flexible for both the casual, and the intensive, language learner. It is a fun way to get students to learn new languages and improve their vocabulary in a fun and interactive way. Overall I just love this app.I have no words but excellent fantastic app.‚≠êüí´‚ö°"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App suddenly has a bug. No XP despite earning it. Double XP chests haven't activated. Not recognising my progress for the league - so I'm stuck at the bottom, despite completing enough lessons to be at the top. I've also ended up paying for the app for a year as I thought it was ¬£4.99 a month and planned to cancel the ad free version after one month. Gutted to see ¬£60 has gone from my bank account and will auto renew in a year's time. Achievements hadn't activated either. Disappointing."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I would've gave this learning app 5 stars review if it not making me keep repeating courses that I've done before everytime there was a big update. As a learning app, this app is wonderful, the courses are gradually level up in the nice pace. But everytime there is a big update of the courses, my completed ""legendary"" level of the courses are gone, I've to re-do almost everything again, and it happened 3times already, it's frustrating. And if it happen again, then I would've quit this app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Within 10 minutes I was reminded why I ditched this app 10 years ago. Useless, repetitive lessons about letters. No sense of progress or excitement. I said I want to use it for travel so why am I being forced to match sounds to single letters over and over and over again? Tried French before and all it seemed to want to teach me was ""The children are eating rice."" Brilliant. That'll come in handy for a multitude of situations. Ignorance is preferable to this garbage."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. It really helps me sharpen my listening skills. I'm building my vocabulary and I'm understanding more of what I hear. However, after playing for 64 days my only complaint is that the Legendary Lessons has a major glitch that needs to be fixed ASAP! Oftentimes when trying to translate a sentence the letters turn red indicating that the word cannot be chosen thus forcing me to forfeit that lesson altogether. This has been happening for a few weeks now. Please help!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"So I came back to Duo after a year or 2 and yes I missed the app. However some things have changed. Before I could retake the legendary classes without paying gems but now I can't. Also, Duo just always happens to drop my connection after a class, especially once I get a 2x boost. I'd have to close and reopen the app just to take the next class and that's not optimal. Still though, great work guys! This is my favorite app for learning any language"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Ever since the Japanese course on the app was updated, I've noticed this frustrating issue where the app isn't correctly placing where I am in the lessons. For example, I noticed I've done 4 lessons in one bubble, but when i close out of the app and restart it, it shows I've only done one. It's kind of irritating, so please fix this as soon as possible."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is best for continuing language practice when you've already studied a language. There isn't much structure or explanation behind grammatical rules or vocab. It's more of a pseudo immersion with some things but there's often little to no context with new vocab. Other issue is there's almost no wiggle room with sentence translation. It has to be the exact, translated wording that is programmed, or it's wrong. e.g. ""I also did this""/""I did this also""-only one of these would be correct."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy duolingo and what it offers. Without premium, you can still learn whatever language you want, too. With premium, however, there are no ads, and you get unlimited hearts. The annoying thing is running out of hearts. You are trying to learn a language, and when you get stopped because you run out of hearts. I've learned a lot from duo. However, I feel like you have to be tutored or be in a language class to get everything. Duo doesn't explain everything. Especially conjagating verbs!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"In only 100 days, I've learned more Spanish and other languages than any ""Real Course"" has taught me. My only complaint, isnt even about the learning. I just wish that the app icon, widget, and UI was more customizable. more styles, more colors that you can change. you could have some Really special ones for premium, and some regular free ones. other than that, easy 5 stars."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is an amazing app. I love learning new languages on it. It also let's you fix a mistake which helps the learning process. I wish there were more listening and Repeating. I am someone who can easily learn a word phrase or sentence in another language by listening and Repeating several times. I'm sure I'm not the only person that can learn this way. Overall, this is an app I use regularly! Thank you to the creators that made Duolingo üòä"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like recent changes to the platform and have updated my review in light of this. Still buggy in places, the speech input is inaccurate sometimes, and it would be nice if you could select learning a language in another language without changing the setting globally on the app. Also, each time on the path should give you an option to test forward. The next section is too far, and each time is so tedious that day learners will get bored reiterating same words. But otherwise, this app is improved."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Almost useless for learning a language on its own. It might be OK as a supplement, but they took most grammar tips away, so you have to look elsewhere if you want to learn structure. Garbled AI voices make voice and listening practice useless. Duolingo is ""woke"" - it forces you to do stories with highly biased and divisive content, so you'll end up constantly translating words and phrases you'll never use outside of california cities. With the newest update it no longer records my progress."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Powered by AI? A recipe for disaster. After a 400+ days streak I've decided to uninstall. They laid off a LOT of people and replaced them with AI, but the AI isn't even good! There's A LOT of mistakes in most languages, weird grammar that a native speaker would NEVER dare pronounce and, of course, an absurd amount of straight up incorrect translations, losing the true meaning of idioms and the nuances of the language. I'll be back when you hire HUMANS and re-open the forums."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"NGL, i am using Duolingo to study Japanese (its been a month) and I didn't expect it would be so much helpful. Lessons are fun to study and leagues are really competitive. But I found some glitch in there. When you go to today's review, you will see conversations and your collection. When you get into story (for me, story doesn't show because i haven't unlock it yet), I cant help but notice that you will still access to previous page (today's review page). Other than that, everything is great!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is is good BUT there are two reasons I take out 3 stars: The voice recognition has issues to understand very short phrases, in my case, when it ask a sequence of 3 numbers in german, or the word Euro. AND, during timed events, when the clock expires there is a pop-up message that will offer you to buy extra time using gems, the buy button is where the Next Question button is, it swaps, it makes it look scummy, like if the devs want you to click on it by mistake, and the purchase is final"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Duolingo. I'm really surprised how much Spanish I've been able to learn using it! If you're thinking of learning a language other than Spanish, French, and English, (Maybe German) just keep in mind the other language courses aren't developed enough to give you full fluency in them. Which is fine, because they will still give you a great foundation, and for free. :)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I this is a good learning app, but aggervating when you're on a roll of learning and if you get so many wrong, you can't continue unless you purchase more stars. I am learning, but it's slower than I like b/c it wants me to purchase stars to continue. if you're fluent in learning a new language, then it won't be an issue, but if that's the case, none of us would be here. Besides that, I enjoy the different exercises that it uses to help me learn."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm unable to practice words that I've learned in the app. I just get the message ""an error has occurred"" when I try to. Samsung 23 Ultra. Beyond that, the app works well, but I want to reinforce what I have learned outside of the lessons! I've tried to contact the developers, but I have not had any replies. I will update my review when this issue is resolved. I am a super duolingo user."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"1. No rules and errors are explained - think for yourself why there is an error here. Extremely infuriates. 2. No drag&drop on Android (but available on iOS). Extremely annoying. 3. Wrong hints - use it and lose your hearts. 4. Animation is good, but excessive and too long, impossible to skip. 5. Sometimes they disable hints on keyboard (predictive text input). Without any explanation."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"(please read to the end developers). This has to be the best language app. I've had a very good learning experience using this app. My favorite aspect is the friend quests, I'm always excited to complete them and they really help me progress. Although I wish a feature where we learners can chat with and practice using texts with those on our friend list could be added. Thanks for a great app.üòä"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app, however I would like it if there were more language opinions, like Icelandic and stuff. The lessons are easy to understand. I wish they would go more I depth with learning stuff like the alphabet and certain grammar rules first. However this all is still very helpful! It's a good starting point for someone like me who is studying German"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is well polished and fun. However, more content should be added to existing courses. Italian only has A1 level, which allows for a very limited understanding of the language but that's it. Also, I would like to see the type and scale of the friend's quest configurable by the user and rewards given accordingly."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've used Duolingo since 2013, lots of changes over the years but I have no major complaints. I've gained a decent grasp of three languages, two more in the works, all totally free and that's really cool. One thing I would REALLY like to see is an option during those basic prompts to say the translation of a sentence rather than having to search for the words and tap on them. It would save a bit of time, feel more natural, and give you more speech practice."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love Duolingo. I have a 1,383 day streak. I even got Super for two years because I genuinely felt like it was worth it. The big update was annoying at first and there's still some changes I really don't like, but some things felt more intuitive at the same time. I've stuck with it. However, upon learning that the company has laid off contract workers in favor of using AI to write lessons, I have canceled my Duolingo Super subscription and I will be looking for a new app to learn on."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The lessons are very helpful in building a good vocabulary. Its well thought through. What I am disappointed in, is that your xp points often just vanishes and are not accounted for on the scoreboard. This is on their end. And even with reports about this issue going several years back, nothing has happened."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is the perfect app to learn a language or to learn several languages. I really enjoy the logical progression through the lessons and the ability to review and re-review harder lessons. I deducted a star because the one aspect of the app I don't enjoy is the competitiveness. It is great you can interact with other users, but like any other app with a social component, you have the people who simply abuse it to the detriment of others and ruin the overall experience."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really nice app!üòÄüëè It's just that it takes a very,VERY long time to load.üôÅ(example:when i press the ""Profile"" button,it takes so long to load that i just close Duolingo and i do something else.) I'm not saying its not good but i think there are a few bugs in the app. Last thing: When my friends look at my profile picture,there is no avatar! Otherwise, great app!üòÑ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,So far so good. There are lots of languages to choose. I am at the beginner level and it seems very beginner to me. There is repetition to help reinforce learning and they have a streamline way to respond to questions. The lessons are bit size so it's long enough impact but not to long to feel like a chore. Even the ads are placed in a pretty good spot after a lesson which gives users a mini break. It's not perfect but I would def recommend and have. It's free with an option to upgrade.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"good bite-sized lessons, and they definitely hold you accountable! I personally enjoy the little applause for reaching a goal, and they make sure to congratulate you. I really would recommend this app! the only problem I could see is that it is made for more traveling purposes, so if you were looking to be fluent and to have a very wide range of vocabulary, then it might be limited for you. but still, all things aside, I do recommend!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Horrible Changes! This was a great app and I have been using it for over a year. The latest update has taken a lot of the fun out of it. I don't enjoy it anymore & most days i don't even want to open the app. The new layout is unfriendly an makes it seem like a chore. New update: Constant app lags. Does not register my data at the cost of falling behind in leagues and having to pay diamonds for streak freezes even when I am active! Happens frequently! Many unnecessary changes, all for the worse."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I was really enjoying the app until it decided to ""sync my progress with the new and improved Chinese course."" It now thinks I've learnt a lot of words and grammar that I've never seen before. I can only review lessons I've never seen before. It has wiped all my previous mistakes so I can't practice things I was struggling with. I can't do new lessons because I no longer have the correct foundation. There was no notification that it was going to do this. Really disappointed."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. It makes learning a new language so fun! I'd like some more detailed grammar related explanations though. Sometimes it's hard to understand why something is counted as an error, when nothing is ever explained. The only real issue I have with this app, is that it freezes pretty often, when I do more than just a few levels at once. Still love it though and the Owl widget is the cherry on top!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I was having a great time, but I think Match Madness is terribly broken. It is impossible to get much past level 5 without buying time extensions or cheating (the match order is predictable!) You are then stuck getting 5-10xp and can't start over at level 1 unless it asks you. It's not fun, and doesn't help me learn. I'd also like to see a list of the words and phrases I have seen and be able to run though unit and section reviews. Edit: They added the ability to see a list of words, and a star"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It was an amazing language app!! One can learn languages as long as they stay consistent with their progress and adapt them through the things they also have fun doing, like studying and listening to music with the language you want to learn, then after, search for the meanings of the lyrics. I hope there would also be additional languages by this year like Bengali, Thai and many more. Thank you!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I adore Duolingo and pay for Super, but a month ago I ran into a level that had a bug which means it cannot be completed. I have submitted bug reports, flagged it, emailed support, and no one has got back to me. It's really interrupted my momentum because I can't progress unless I skip ahead (and I can't stand the idea of that!! haha). I would really like the problem to be fixed, but more importantly it would be nice if someone from the massive empire that is Duolingo actually responded."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app for a few years (Super Duo family plan) and overall it's a great way to learn. My only complaint is that in recent months, I've noticed that the daily quests screen is slow to update. I've almost lost my streak when a quick peek at that screen shows I've already gotten 30 XP that day, only for it to suddenly change to 0 XP several seconds later, right before my eyes - because it was initially showing yesterday's info. Sometimes I can't tell if I've done a lesson or not."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo has really gone downhill recently. Yesterday was just the latest of several incidents where I gained a significant number of xp points, only to find myself knocked back down to where I had been prior. I had 84 xp yesterday morning and earned another 80 last night for a total of 164xp. However, this morning, I was back down to 84xp. This is very disappointing, especially for a paid subscription. I see from the comments that I am not the only one experiencing this. Please fix this issue."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been using the app for 2 years. The paid version, Super Duolingo, is far worse than the free product. It doesn't make any sense to design pay-to-win features in an app that is supposed to be educational. Because if you pay to win a language test you're literally paying not to learn. On top of this basic flaw, the system running the ads is very buggy, especially since the last update. The app will crash at least once a day when trying to run ads. The ads themselves are often for scam apps."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have been a duolingo Super user for years. It was a great start; but the app was not helping me to progress in my language study. I want to cancel my subscription. It renewed 8 days ago. My first cancelation request was 3 days after renewal. Doesn't look like Duolingo wants to refund the money. Would have given them a better review before they tried to steal a year's subscription.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Duo no longer teaches the structure of the language. It's more like memorization and inference. There used to be a notes section explaining the grammar and a comments section where people could discuss lessons. What little help there was is gone. It's also extremely difficult to review because there are no longer titles to show where certain words and phrases were added. I'm guessing most of duo is now in the paid version. Free is doable but harder than it should be. 5 stars now 3
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Good language resource but the ads are constant and repetitive. It's clearly done on purpose to annoy you and force into buying premium. The whole app is set up that way, including punishing users for making mistakes with the heart system, which is ridiculous considering how difficult it can be to learn a new language. I'm starting to lose interest and will look elsewhere to learn."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo was amazing before the current update now. I miss the repeated lessons & crowning levels. It made diffenciating lessons easy. But now its all mixed in with old & new/unfamiliarized questions, plus the update lags so hard. And, there's no hearing the sentences in the lessons once completed anymore which is really unfortunate. It's frustrating to learn sentences when I've never came across them before. I liked how it was a year ago."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This app is great 130 days in. Only real problem is that I get warnings in the middle of the night telling me I'm going to lose my streak and use a streak freeze regardless of whether I have done a lesson that day or not. I really wish they would fix this glitch. Also when I get an answer wrong the correction often covers up my answer so I can't check it to see what I did wrong. Then it kicks you out if you get too many wrong instead of just making you a watch an ad or something.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've been learning French for a year, so I can only speak about learning French. Duolingo is good, it presents good challenges, constantly switches between listening, watching and speaking. It doesn't explain all subjects well, which has caused me to be stuck, loose hearts/streaks. I would say use Duolingo as a basis and use it at the same time as watching TV shows/movies/interviews in the language you're learning. Super Duolingo isn't worth it. I prefer using the Web version without the hearts."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Duolingo for a few years now, and while I'm not fluent in conversation, I'm able to read my chosen language fairly well. I can also understand a large part of what people at the supermarket are saying in passing, which I think is a pretty strong point in the favor of this app. The hearts system will forever annoy me, because the app was honestly better without it. But I do like the changes they made to the Chinese course where you can learn pinyin and hanzi, that was much needed!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"After 85 days, I've removed some stars. My main issues: Sentences are oddly structured. I would never say or need half of the sentences taught, especially when traveling for a few weeks. Even the sentences in my native tongue are awkward and clunky. Their outlines before each section don't always help and often the lessons aren't related to them. Only bumped it from 2 to 3 stars because it can be used for free. I'll stick to Rosetta Stone where I've been able to use and retain more."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"So far so good, on a free plan but will consider a subscription Edit, just had a notification to upgrade, actually the price is OK, but there is no option to pay monthly, all in one go 12 months up front, the problem with that is somewhere like Indonesia that is a lot of money up front that very few can afford, making the payment monthly is much fairer and would I believe result in more people signing up."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's very good but there are just a few frustrating aspects. If I skip or add a word on accident but I know better, it doesn't let me go back and correct it by myself until we are reviewing my mistakes. There could be more precise translation words when it gives us choices of what words to put to translate. Oh, and it keeps starting over each day. I'm not sure if that's a bug or just for review but it's really annoying and time consuming. üòÇü§£ I'd give it 3 1/2-4 stars."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really like this app, it helps a lot in learning another language. But one of the things I hate about it are the ads. Every lesson I do, there is an ad! Though after a few seconds, they'll give you the option to close. Despite that, some of the ads will not exit, even when they give you the button to exit. You'll click and click until they are done with that ad or they have delayed, and my phone is brand new! Please, fix it. It is so annoying!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It definitely is not the same as taking classes to learn a language, but it can help at the beginning. It has a ""repetition makes perfect"" approach. However, it really lacks emphasis on grammar rules. Also, it would be really beneficial if there was an option to choose between the Latin American and the Spanish accent on the Spanish course (mind it is a very widespread language) because now I am stuck with the former pronunciation and vocabulary when I'd rather learn the latter."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great UI, but very slow paced learning. This is a bad alternative to learning any languages, compared with 1. Books 2. Video lessons 3. Live courses 4. Flashcards The selection of words from their ""keyboard"" honestly makes it look more like a jigsaw puzzle than what could've been a great source to train spelling abilities (such as Japanese, Chinese, and Korean characters). I do understand that a lot of sentences can be expressed in many different ways, though, so this isn't quite a major issue."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is fun, the animations, voices and characters with their different personalities makes it so much better than all the other language-learning apps and websites I've tried. I don't use premium, but I got GIFTED it as a prize in one of the treasure boxes for three days and it was completely free!! My only problem is that it shouldn't take a premium to review our mistakes, and we should get more of the blue coins more often, as I want to make everything Legendary but it is hard to save up"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app and makes it super easy to learn a language but constantly sends you super annoying notifications if you don't practice for a couple days like... "" Duo thinks your ignoring him!"" etc. and doesn't let you play for a while if you run out of gems. It also, shows you too many ads of Super Duolingo which can get irritating. However, it's a good app ,but could use improvement."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"it's really helpful to compete with others every week. But the grammar is a bit neglected. Even new words comes without an article for the first time and one needs to sometimes figure out by yourself or search in other sources. ive also purchased the other most famous teaching app and their grammar is much better. but at the end duolingo has unmatched ability to keep me going and attentive to do every single day. The game also has serious glitches, it does not count properly and has tech issues."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The progression is steady & feels easy. Mistakes are reviewed in the lesson and lessons are generated to help correct previous mistakes in the icon errors. New vocabulary is introduced in very small batches within the topic. I love the fact that we have Freezes, it helps especially if we have to travel or too ill to do any lesson to keep our streak. I really feel like I'm learning without effort, the free version is very good but the paying option has more options. I highly recommend Duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Thank you for fixing the too long units issue in Spanish. It is the perfect size right now. It is doable in a week. Please don't change this again. People have yearly goals based on this. Also please bring back achievement progress bar. Update: The words in Spanish is a good addition. Please add a ""random"" sort option to study words at random"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Update March 5 2024. I've paid for the premium version (now called super Duolingo) the last 4+ years now. The premium features simply not working consistently and seems to be getting worse. The latest example is the Review Mistakes feature. I made mistakes but nothing ever lists. Also, the unit rewind keeps repeating the same 2 lessons over and over. The stories also seem to cycle through 5 (and it doesn't even highlight which you haven't done like before. what's the point paying premium?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm just learning spanish for fun, but it's very cool to fo with this app. only one thing i noticed: when you need to translate a sentence from English to Spanish, you can't tell if the ""you"" is singular or plural, so would be great if you did some kind of markers to make it clearer! edit: also would love to have the option to turn off the vibration!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a great app as a supplementary resource for learning a foreign language. I started on the free plan with ads, but I then moved to the paid plan without ads, and it is so worth it. The app uses the Common European Framework (CEF) to describe the language proficiency levels (i.e. A1-C2), which is very useful. And the app has an excellent user interface as well. Kudos to the designers and developets, great work!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"For the most part, this app is fantastic, it's really helped me to be able to learn new languages easily. I'd love to see Maori added to the list of languages available to learn. My only issue is with exp pots, I would like it if the app didn't automatically claim them and I had an inventory system to use them when I wanted. Sometimes I pop on for 5-10 minutes but then end up getting gifted exp that I then feel guilty for not wanting to use it then and there. Let me save them for later please!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Update 2024 please fix the random crashing during a lesson. Just crashes and won't restart. - The perfect app for learning and practicing written and reading skills in other languages. The user interface is excellent and intuitive, with friendly reminders to practice. I think the app and the Duolingo system has been done very well and I would consider going Pro if I were more disciplined about practicing! Highly recommended, I have done some lessons in a few languages and it is very consistent."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Decent. However I cannot give it 5 stars because of its lack of accessibility in crucial places. For example, I can just barely complete the matching exercises, because the app requires me to turn off my screen reader. Guess how useful that is to someone who can't see. , it's super frustrating, especially when I am made to repete the exercise for getting it wrong. I understand the app doesn‚Äôt understand how unhelpful that is, But if any of you devs out there see this, please, if you care at all"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great at teaching very basic stuff. But spends more time trying to be a game than a teaching app. Often just throws words at you and expects you to know them right away, then punishes you for getting them wrong. When it works, it creates a great cycle of engagement, but when it doesn't, it creates a vicious cycle of discouragement. Fun app, but not great for teaching."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's awesome how much you get for free with Duolingo. I personally have no problem with the number of ads in the free version. For my goals, I don't need to have unlimited hearts. The Duolingo team has changed things up several times, and there are things that I miss about previous iterations. For instance, now you are forced into a specific learning path sequence, which eliminates a lot of the ability to choose what to learn about. Even with that, I'm very happy with this app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The new update basically killed the kanji learning feature. It's just a vocabulary game, which is good if that's how it is advertised, but you can't learn Kanji through Duolingo anymore. Before, you actually wrote out Kanji in its stroke order and learned some words. Now, Kanji study is totally up to you independent of Duolingo. You could say that most people only want to read Japanese, not write it. But then the course introduces writing exercises that are impossible without selfstudy."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The countdown on the rapid lessons is rediculous! I can't possibly type that fast, as well as it being a language that isn't native to my keyboard so typos and corrections occur. Yet the timer keeps ticking :( other than that I'm loving it so far, besides the excess of ads, that is. Which I suppose is to be expected. However, if the price were a bit more reasonable I would have no bothers paying for super, even if just to remove the ads, which I imagine will drive me away relatively soon."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Fantastic app. It's fun and addictive in the right ways, and has helped me get interested in learning again. However, the ads are a problem. I know the app needs ads to run, but I wear headphones (as the app recommends) to better hear the sounds, and then after each lesson has a VERY loud ad plays right in my ear, which is both annoying and hurts. Perhaps playing ads on half volume or mute as a default could be implemented?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I like the app. However, when I play consistently, it becomes too demanding to complete all the daily tasks when the algorithm does not allow me to fulfill them all unless I complete so many lessons. I think this is unreasonable and discourages me from being interested in playing as much. It also makes the user experience less fun. I could skip a day, use a freeze, and reset the algorithm to set easier daily tasks. But this contrasts a true spree and creates gaps between lessons."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Longer I use this app the less I like it. My Japanese lessons progress has been rolled back so many times, and it's just frustrating to have really non-sensical sentences as examples. Over the years, they have removed more features than added. There used to be a community that helped to explain grammar and other questions, but they REMOVED IT. And with the news of layoffs and replacing their workers with AI... yeah, I don't feel comfortable supporting this app. The owl was cute, though."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Still 'syncing my work'. If this is an attempt to force me to upgrade to the paid version, its not working but it's getting ridiculous. 25.2.24 - I don't know what happened but I can't progress at all in the last three weeks. I keep getting a message that Duolingo synced my progress to a new and improved content, however I'm repeating the same lessons over and over because it won't stop 'sync' my work. I've been using Duolingo for over 2.5 years and have never been more frustrated with the app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I actually love the app and even wanted to upgrade to premium a month at a time as I can't really afford to drop $80 right now. Had a hard time finding where to do that without directly clicking an ad. Found a button that says renew subscription. I click it expecting a menu with payment options. Instead it automatically charges my account for $83 when I have never had that subscription before (not the whole year). How are they allowed to do that??
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Beware of super charges. I tried the super option and really like it! It really is helpful practicing every day. When I signed up for the trial it advertised it as $6.99 a mo. When the day for the trial ended I really did think that the app ad free was worth $6.99 so I didn't cancel, however it charged me $90 for an entire year. I would give 5 stars if there was better payment options. Being charged all up front sucks I would much rather pay a monthly subscription."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoyed the app, but multiple times, they will go through and completely overhaul your course changing things around. They'll add words and phrases into previous units you've already completed saying that you've learned it, but you haven't. It's really frustrating. It kills any passion and momentum you have learning. Also, despite the pictures they show, I have never once gotten a speaking lesson."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It isn't truely motivating to keep learning your language day after day. It gets boring after a while. And I find that it doesn't actually help too much when trying to learn a language, I think that their methods aren't the best or just doesn't work well. It is good for a free app, and I doubt that premium would make the experience that much better. It is good that aren't ads every single lesson and that you can learn offline. Meh, it barely works. Y'know, if you are desperate. It is fine......"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A good course which I am enjoying but, irritatingly it uses American English. I studied mathematics, not math and I actually go to the cinema (Italian word cinema) not a movie theatre. Just a couple of examples. Secondly, some of the Italian words are not the same as would be everyday. I have an Italian course on Audible and there are significant variations."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app has a very hard time detecting any voice input causing any voice input qurstions to be skipped. The developers should work harder on the voice input. The other language apps does have this issue. On top of the previous issue, Duolingo is unavailable to correctly keep a streak when the exercise span the day boundary. This is a very frustrating outcome from an app that prone consecutive usage. Life get in the way and I make the effort to learn at the end of the day."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it's great honestly. I've been learning Korean and it's been helping me. It's not like they force you to watch ads every 5 seconds,most of the time you can choose whether you get an ad or not. And instead of having to wait for days for hearts,you can practice for them! it's a great learning game/app for any age if willing to learn more of a language!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Do NOT care about their (free) customers! Since the redesign, things have changed for the worse. The tips before lessons have been replaced with unhelpful ""guidebooks"". The helpful ability to comment was disabled on Android. Now there's no help or reasons given when something is new. There's no learning, only memorization. Learning went from fun to being a chore. This review was 1st left 6 months ago. Still no response. I email them often, but get no response since I quit the paid version."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A good way of learning a completely new language for this beginner. Lots of nudges to keep you engaged. Every now and then there are words that are not explained before they are used, but most of the time you can click on them to see what they mean or you soon learn them. The app functions well, I've had no crashes or bugs. Adverts are not too intrusive as they appear between lessons, and there is a way to pay for an advert free version with many other benefits. Yo soy muy feliz con Duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"You need to know American English. i.e. ""downtown"" and missing out ""of"" and ""that"" . They never accept Football, only soccer I dislike clicking to the next ""page"" and the audio starting in a nano second . i would prefer to click to start it. However; the whole site is put together spectacularly well and is a fabulous learning tool. It can be totally free, which is amazing. i have chosen to pay for ""super duo"". if you can afford it, it's worth every penny. Happy learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Started out with it and it was fine, but after a while it got to a point where I just don't want to engage with the app anymore. It does have genuine language learning, which is why 2 stars instead of 1, but it feels like proper learning is devalued. Instead of understanding the language, I'm taught to memorize individual translations, and more emphasis than I'm happy with is placed on maintaining daily streaks and competing for rank. Will be seeking a more effective alternative going forward."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a great tool to help learn a new language. It might have changed since I started my course, but I'd recommend they start courses with alphabet familiarity, rather than jumping straight into ""Where is the plaza"". aside from that, it's great. I am presently not under duress while writing this with a giant green owl in my living room. that'd be ridiculous."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It is DEEPLY discouraging to put in months, and months and years of daily effort only to have your entire path of progress scrambled and revamped with ""new and improved content!"" The entire concept of a gamified path is useless if the path can be rewritten at any time. I'm now facing the prospect of what feels like starting over. AGAIN. and it's honestly hard not to just quit. Especially when I cannot have any faith that my new efforts won't be wiped out in the next update."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! I'm learning Italian, and I find it very engaging; you can have friends, weekly challenges, daily & monthly quests, badges etc able to go back and revise previous sections... The coding guys have a kinda quirky sense of humour that they bring out through the various characters in the lessons. Then there are these passive-aggressive reminders that they send as notifications... lol! Generally, it's a really good app for anyone who wants to learn any language from scratch!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Progression is WAY WAY WAY too slow sometimes. It should let me skip levels in a unit. However, Duolingo has been very helpful in getting me better at Spanish and more familiar with the language. BUT I also don't like how we don't have the option most of the time to type out the translations instead of clicking/tapping the little blocks with the words. I hate it, ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M DOING IT ON PC. I prefer typing and I want for there to be ALWAYS the option to type. PLEASE ADD THAT!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I used to love Duolingo app 2-3 years ago, but not anymore. The update consisting the levels has made it less interesting to play/learn . If possible pls bring back the old feature . In addition to that pls remove the ads. It is so annoying. I know money necessary for the developers but I don't like the idea of 'pay to play' . I used to love the time when the stories were not fixed in the learning path but was kept separately. Pls pls bring back the old feature and I will surely give 5 stars."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I heard the old japanese system was complete trash... but I got into this re entry from a friend and the system is great and really been keeping me interested as I been working on learning Japanese on and off over the last few years. I really like a lot of the systems in place while I do have small issues with Grammer choices made as the ""correct"" answers reporting anything wrong seems easy. my mane issues is the small Grammer stuff and the app saying I missed whole days I didn't."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"the lessons very simple to follow for the most part. Some of the character voices are difficult to understand at times. But the overall app is very well made. I've never received any type of errors. The way they have incorporated learning into a game format, helps to keep your attention. I was skeptical. Months went by where I thought ""I'm just not getting this"". After about 9-10 months, I started hearing Spanish sentences in songs,and I would recognize and understand Spanish written words."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's a good starter app. I do think it sometimes stays on the same few words a bit too long for me. It can give a false sense of progression if you are only reusing the same words because you'll think you memorized it now but it was obvious: you'll forget it (or mix it up) at a later time). I wish it learned to move on and return older words if you forgot it much later like Anki. Also wish I could disable the voice over on pressed words in same language voice to text quizzes for harder exposure.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I find that learning French this way is challenging. Often there are no references to the correct way to conjugate the verbs. Even the examples won't show the correct choice. So I use the example and get it wrong. Also, the speaking lessons often don't hear what I am saying when though I say the phrase exactly correct. They say learning English is very difficult. Well, the French don't say half of the letters in any given word, so how is one supposed to know that?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Started in 2018 but stopped around 2020. I restarted in Jan 2024. I feel it's worth paying premium to support the app. In addition, they also have a podcasts to help you hit your language learning goals. There's a competitive aspect (league boards) to help motivate people like me learn a little more every day. Bug: sometimes the XP score for the league board isn't updated or it even goes back to a previous total. So, while my two day XP count is around 2,850, my league score is only at 2,400."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This is a very good app to accompany you when learning a new language. It keeps you quite engaged and motivated. Since the discussions/forum part was removed from the exercises the App keeps you guessing what the rules are to the sentences you are learning. For example there is now no way to know why a sentence is formed in a certain way without leaving the app and googling or opening an actual grammar book. Quite frustrating.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Longer ads will make me to switch a new app. Today I had to watch two extremely long ads without the option to turning them off. If this will continue I will have to search for a new tool for learning. I've been using this app for 10 years I think. I am down with short ads, but these extreme long ones drive me fuzzylizzy to the delete app option. Update: 3/24/2024 the ads are getting even longer, I downgraded the app to 2 stars.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Korean lessons and in particular pronunciations sounds to written English answers is pretty bad. I had several native speakers listen to Duolingo saying ""ddu"" and Duolingo telling us the answer is supposed to be ""nu"". a few of the Korean pronunciations are poorly recorded. You have to turn volume to max to even hear anything at all. So maybe recordings are bad. Warning. Be prepared for your ears to bleed. By max volume, the ads will make you deaf. 2 stars as the app is easy to use."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. The way it is structured to learn is really good for many learning styles. There are pictures, matching games, and speech portions so if you are a visual learn or prefer to read it has a good blend. The free version is wonderful if you're okay with a few ads but I am definitely considering trying the paid version for all the added benefits it has."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Cute study app! I have been using it to study Japanese which is a language I already know a bit of. I hear the desktop version is better for learning but I have only used the app and that seems to only be a study tool. They don't explain things very well. I really dislike their league system and the reminders are really obnoxious. Even if you do your lessons everyday you can still get demoted. Not encouraging at all. You can't be in leagues with friends either, which is not fun."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like it but the part about ma'am being 2 separate words threw me off... I lost points and I'm pretty sure it isn't 2 words... Ma and 'am were 2 different selections for senorita... Also the pictures can be deceiving, the one with the cat holding a credit card is confusing because it's a cat not a human... made me think it was disturbing the person's study so I chose ""study"" instead of ""pay""... cats don't use credit cards so it wasn't clear enough what was going on in the photo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,All pronunciations disappeared after the february updates! I can also hear apps sound of the right and wrong answers as well as when the lesson ends. It's impossible to use the app for studying when you don't know how to pronounce the words! Listening exercises are no more. And also I've never been able to practice speaking because of the bug with micro. This is a huge disappointment
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I don't know if this will happen if you continue your lessons, but as a native Vietnamese speaker, the Vietnamese selection is not accurate. Sure, it is accurate for certain topics, but most of the time, not. The app only uses one version/dialect for words and does not differentiate between ""pronouns."" The pronunciation is also from one dialect, not others. It is, btw, too formal. For example, you would not have to say ""xin l·ªói"" every time, like ordering food, unless you're sorry for something."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A great deal of fun learning a new language : √à molto divertente imparare una nuova lingua. Keep in mind, concentrate only on your individual progress and learning. There are a bunch of people who either already know the language or use duolingo as though it is a game to score points and defeat everyone else involved, making it difficult to advance levels. Apparently, these folks have hours to score thousands, ensuring they advance but average learners don't. Its still enjoyable."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love duolingo! It is very fun and entertaining. What do you do when your bored? You can do this! You complete quests, climb up the leaderboard and get badges. In my opinion, this is one of the most useful apps! Zero ads. I love it as well because after 2 lessons, there is a ad instead of after one or in a middle of a lesson. Duolingo is an awesome and free app, if your interested in learning, install Duolingo, choose your language and your all set! No credit card or money needed! Bye all! üåπ"

I try to open duolingo, but it just closes the app. I tried to delete duolingo and redownload. It worked for a bit, but the bug came back. Hopefully this bug gets fixed :D"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app doesn't explain grammar or how the language works in its 'technicalities'. And that is very important. This app just throws you the exercise with the meaning of the words if you hover them. That's great for vocabulary, to memorise. But it fails miserably in other aspects. I wish they had a section with explanations, even if it's behind a pay wall. Also crashes in a middle of a exercise and I am forced to repeat the entire thing. It doesn't record progress. Very frustrating."

I really enjoyed it being supportive through my journey of learning and help coach me through everything. I honestly think you should try this app because it was really helpful and you can play it anytime! Before and after you preferred time and it helps you speak a new and perfect language for free! It was a game changer and life saver because now I can teach other kids my age, older and younger, to speak Spanish ."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I loved learning Hindi 15-20 minutes a day. The repetition helps it stick. That said, Duolingo is incomplete for Hindi. If you stick with it for 6 months you'll complete the entire track. It's 100% repetition after that. They don't even vary up daily review lessons. It's pretty bad. You want to keep the learning streak going, but don't want to use the app. Also lacks teaching of grammar or rules. You just have to figure it out (use Pimsleur to learn rules and more correct pronunciation)."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Easy and gamified way to learn any language. Great community and several users. My only issue is it doesn't count how often you took a lesson per day, and only focuses on streaks. I, as well as some of my friends with busy lifestyles, would like to keep count of how many days I signed in for a lesson, and not focus on prioritizing my streak once i lose my streak, I suddenly lose interest in learning the language itself through duolingo"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it works if you use it. the variety of exercises has vastly improved over the years. I really think the auditory discrimination ones are so important for improving comprehension and pronunciation. the speech exercises are the poorest. I've literally never gotten one incorrect, so they are not accurate at detecting errors. my favorite tasks are the match madness and stories. really great for building word retrieval and listening comprehension."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"1. Please allow us to move the word boxes around in the sentence. It is very frustrating if you forgot one word and have to start all over. This used to be possible a few years ago. 2. When we use voice for numbers, and your programme translate those into numbers (instead of text) amd then you mark that as false.. very frustrating as well. I feel like those are simple implementations that could make a nice difference. Also add some grammar tips to your app to dominate the world"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"A good app to learn the basics, but I've just encoutered a major problem : xhile leasing Chinese, I had progressed to stage 4 and was in the middle of it. But they implemented a major change in the order in which we're learning the words and sentences. As a result, some levels are now considered as completed (stage 1, 2 and 3), but for some of them, it's not what I've learned. I basically have to erase everything and redo it, as I've missed some vocabulary and grammar because of that."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"If you think you can seriously learn a language with this app better look further. I use it as a supplement to an irl course or I would long abandon it. Gamification works to a certain extent, but at the amount of effort this program requires to be useful you would be better off with a textbook. It's simultaneously too much repetitiveness and not enough practice, my settings for Japanese keep glitching and turning on romaji. Plus abundance of artificial audio instead of real native speakers."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Somehow they managed to push out updates to make the UX significantly worse than it was before, and it was bad enough then: now it has a number of unskippable animations that ignore the Animations setting and significantly increase the time it takes to do anything on the app; it continues to load keyboards that aren't installed but now it also straight-up loads the wrong keyboard at times; the voice recognition is still awful. There are better alternatives out there."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There are many good things about Duolingo and I have learnt a lot in a few months, but it could be much better. There isn't enough explanation for why certain words or grammar are used. There isn't an option for choosing what you learn - I'm learning Spanish for a holiday and so don't really need to plough through sections on education and work. It constantly says I'm learning a new word for words that have been taught previously, and the speaking exercises are hit or miss."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The overall experience is ok. The translation questions sometimes demand improper english or odd phrasing. The app doesn't give an explanation for why you missed a question. Sometimes you get the translation they were looking for, or an occasional example that has nothing to do with the question you missed. It not only fails to clarify much, it prompts ""was this a good explanation?"" without any option for no. There's bugs too. I've learned a lot of words, but no real way to use them together."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"A restructuring of the Chinese course has completely messed up everything. For some reason I had to relearn some courses that I've already learned. What's worse is that the course made me skip some lessons I've haven't done yet. It now assumes that I know around 30 or so words that were never taught. Me keeping notes have just gone out the window, guess I was a fool for trying to organize them. I've canceled my premium subscription, will stop using the app once it runs out."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Used to be a huge fan, haven't used for a couple of years, now it's littered with ads, pesters you constantly if notifications are turned off, it has a limit on the amount of time you can use it and when I was brushing up on my skills and when translating ""Wien is great"" and I got it wrong for using Gro√üartig instead of Super, I knew it was time to install something else like Memrise. I wonder if that has also gone rapidly downhill from where it was a few years back."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Gamifying language learning is the best way to get someone to commit, return, and create a habit. While it doesn't contain all the things needed to fully learn a language, it's a great tool to have offered for free. Also, the widget tends to bug out and not update, making me lose my streak, which frustrates me. The widget is why I left this at 4 stars, with other minor nitpicks."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"While I can appreciate the effectiveness of game-type elements for keeping people regularly engaging with language learning, there are some aspects of how they actually teach a language that are sub-par. Main examples that come to mind are a lack of explanation of grammatical concepts or language nuances in general, and especially the lack of articles when drilling vocab in gendered languages. Also, their corrections of mistakes with ambiguous translations are often misleading."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app would be better if you could choose to reuse/customize parts of the lessons. Like the character writing practice, or choosing which vocab you need help on, etc. It tries to tell you which words/things you need help on, but the lessons often skip vocab you learned earlier until the very end, so the program doesnt have mistakes on record to flag those words. The lessons are too likely to just randomly repeat stuff, and not go over everything evenly"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've used duolingo every day for a year to practice Japanese, but I find the constant (unannounced) course updates are increasingly making the app unusable. It's really frustrating to log on and find that every few months you're suddenly at a completely different place in the course, with random content which is either too easy/hard or contains new kanji you are expected to 'know'. Japanese duolingo also lacks content (eg stories) and doesn't teach kanji well. I might find another app instead."

The most recent update changed it so Personalized Practice has the same icon as normal lessons now and that's just awful. It was fine before but now it looks and feels worse. It makes lessons look overwhelming with no breaks at a glance and it's hard to tell where each lesson is when you're reviewing. More bad updates, going down to 3 stars. 2 if this keeps up..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've recently hit 900 straight days and here's my thoughts on the app: -It works, and I'm getting better at the language I'm studying, little by little -The ads are pretty bad, sometimes it's faster to just quit instead of sitting through another repetitive ad. -Primarily, you want to pay to get rid of the annoying ads. -I got a free trial to the premium service, and it's actually worse than the free version. They ask for more money constantly, the daily tasks are worse, and the value is lower."

Every time there is a major update and ""restructure"" the ""paths,"" I get a bunch of stuff I haven't actually learned yet. I'm just expected to know it. What? The point is for this app to teach me a new language well, it fails. Often, the sentence structure is so off, it makes no sense to a native English speaker learning a new language. Just put the English sentence in the same structure as what I'm learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have the premium, and its very nice! Not being afraid of being penalized for making a mistake really helps. I'm learning Mandarin currently, and they just added a writing practice for characters, which is very nice. They also updated the learning course... which is fine, but I wish they took into account that theres now a bunch of words that are in previous lessons that I haven't learned yet, that show as me having learned them already."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app is getting worse and worse. The score still doesn't always update. My progress isn't always stored - I've done some lessons 3 times! DUOLINGO DON'T RESPOND TO FEEDBACK! I paid for the app for a year. I don't think I'll be paying again! The only English is American English so in some cases I have to translate from French to US English to UK English! Seems like they care more about money than valuing language.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a very effective and engaging learning aid when used in conjunction with separate learning resources. It is a useful tool for getting to grips with pronunciation and spelling, but perhaps falls a little short on explaining grammar concepts in my experience. Would still recommend for anybody new to or even experienced in learning a second language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing! There is not very many adds and I can learn offline. I can have many courses and I actually enjoy learning. I was a little frustrated about the hearts but not to much. It is really fun and helped me learn a lot. I am learning Japanese, French, and a few others and honestly have never gotten so far in Japanese. I have never seen an app as good as this and haven't had any major issues. I am having significant progress and feel confident so I really suggest this for learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There's not enough examples in the exercises, the same sentences are repeating too often. There's hardly any flexibility allowed in answers. An answer may be correct, but it is considered false, because the author of the question didn't bother to put alternatives into possible input options. Narrow-minded and lazy!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It forces you to use the app daily and try to rank first in every league. its frustrating when I barely have any time, especially playing other games that gets put first by duo. its good motivation but i widh this was just a choice to compete with other people. i would just want to learn the language. either way, it doesn't know much about how to actually speak it. only the textbook versions."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Fairly good on the whole but this app does have plenty of annoying deficiencies and inconsistencies with odd translations, strange sounding English, very limited explanation of grammatical rules, and little idea of new words. The worst problem is that the app often messes up the page layout on my phone to hide some or all of the answer fields so it's impossible to enter some of the answer which forces me to abandon the session and have to dig out my laptop to complete it. VERY frustrating."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"My experience would be much better if Duolingo didn't have so many bugs. Or, at least, if their support team really tried to solve the problems and not only sent you letters kinda ""We've received your report, thank you!"". One of the bugs is especially discouraging. Duolingo takes off your XP! For example, you gained 75 XP at level 12 of Match Madness, but Duolingo adds up only 60 XP to your score! I've found out on Reddit that this bug is more than a year old, and Duolingo still hasn't fixed it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"For a basic build-up of vocabulary, duolingo can be good. Overall, though, this app is lacking and inconsistent. Constantly repeats the same 10 sentences for reading and some listening practices until you test out and then delivers completely new terms. This is not how learning a language works. The idea is to build up knowledge, not test unknown terms. Final level for 'Chinese' and Spanish is a basic intermediate level at best."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Can they fix pronunciation error once and for all? How is it possible that the male and female voices say the same word with accents/stress on different syllables of the word? How are we supposed to know which one is the correct way? Also, it is extremely frustrating when the app faults you for an answer if you don't include article ""a"" in English. Yet the app is allowed to make plural vs singular errors no problem..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have been doing my lessons for the last 45mins and it isn't being added to my total. Please help! I even just uninstalled and reinstalled Dulingo hoping that It freezes often when I'm trying to do a lesson or practice lesson and doesn't let me continue. I have to go in and out of the app hoping it will work, but it doesn't always unfreeze. I came here to check if there is an update or if needs one and there isn't one. It's a wonderful tool otherwise. 12.8.23"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The system is useful, but not great. They try too hard to push their paid service when it doesn't seem to add much value in learning a language. The way answers are scored (how words are graded and spoken) are inconsistent. And more can be done to support and encourage students in the process-the friends feature is almost worthless."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"In recent years I spend a lot of time correcting Duo's Italian mistakes. It used to be that you'd get an email back that they made the correction. Now I don't think they're even bothering to check the responses. No, folks, you don't have to say NOI dobbiamo... Dobbiamo IS the noi for dovere. Use the free version for Italian drills if you want, but don't waste your money trying to learn on this platform. Spend it with Italy Made Easy and you'll learn a lot more (and it will actually be correct)."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been using it for years and I've loved it. But some of the new features on here have started to bother me. I dislike how lessons are being taught now, and it has become repetitive and tiresome. I know I am able to skip to the next unit if I've learned enough, but I dislike the feeling of not fully finishing it all. Also I dislike the new avatar profiles, I wish they were optional! I miss my old profile picture with my dog, I didn't think I would be stuck using the avatars..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app for learning, intuitive and user-friendly too. You guys are the best, really. I do have a problem though, when I started out, XP lightning challenge used to be available for Spanish (for my account) during the week but all of a sudden it got changed to Match madness. I enjoy the former challenge better for certain reasons and I don't know if there's a way to revert/undo the change. I've had to start learning a different language because of this change. I wish it could be changed."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duoling once was good. It lacked on explanations of gramatical concepts but filled the need for a practicing tool well. Unfortunately it has consecutively been changing to the worse. About a year ago they took away the ability to pick your own lessons and now you are forced to do endless senseless repetitions. Using it now is like a painful grind to fulfull their gamified goals, it's absolutely demotivating."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall, the app is great! My only complaint, so far, is the font they use is confusing, at times. The capital ""I"" looks the same as the lower case ""l"" (just like right here). When I'm trying to learn words I don't know and they switch between upper case and lower case letters, I can't tell if they're using the i/I or the l/L, causing me to answer incorrectly."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App is buggy. Pressing near an answer will select wherever the app can reasonably reject a correct answer, to try and hawk the paid version. No easily accessible way to extend streaks or purchase streak freezes, as the store controls were eliminated in the previous update. Used to love this app, but it's all just a cash grab now. *Edit* has only gotten worse, ads now show up whenever time is important, forcing purchases. Absolutely abysmal. Something so good traded for greed. :("
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It used to feel like the app was earnestly trying to teach you a language, but after recent updates I feel like they're just trying to run down my hearts with repetitive, boring lessons. I stopped learning and now just repeat the same 3 sentences in different variations. Losing hearts because I'm bored and not paying, not because I don't know the answer..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is a game changer when it comes to learning a new language. I struggled with learning Spanish back in highschool but this clicks with me. I think the difference is that it's like playing a game with levels and challenges and a social media aspect to it. so it doesn't feel like memorizing phrases and words but more of a game that just happens to teach you another language
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've definitely learned a lot from Duo, but I don't like the heart system very much (there are ways to get around paying for hearts, but it's a little annoying). The ranking system is a little weird as well. Additionally, some translations don't fit quite right, and it doesn't explain grammatical stuff very well, but overall, you can learn quite a bit as long as you get in the habit of doing a few lessons everyday"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I really liked this app back in 2023 . Then I re-downloaded it and realised what a mistake I would have made if I rated it that time . I absolutely HATE the super duolingo okay . This version was newly introduced in 2023 and it wasn't as bad as it is now. Duolingo has so many ads like there was hardly any in 2023 . They don't even let me do the ramp up challenge. It was free back then .I know longer call duolingo a free app. Please don't download duolingo anymore .Miss old duo .Bring it back !!!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A very good app, easy way to develop a habit of daily practice. This app is a good conversation companion you have no one to practise with. I like the way the lessons build on each previous one. The reading lessons that seem to throw words at you that you never came across before! Well I suppose it makes your learning muscles strain harder to develop faster. One more thing, when you say something is free then let it all be free üòÅ. That for me is what holds back my fifth star for the app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is undeniably good. When learning languages, it takes you through the very basics, repeating the material so many times that you easily perceive and remember it. As a result, you begin to understand native speakers, compose quite complex sentences and express your thoughts professionally. There are also a large number of quality courses to choose from. Thanks to the Duo team üíöüíöüíö"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"My problem with your app is that whenever you update, you shuffle your lessons. And when I look at the past units that I have finished, there were lessons that were shuffled there that are marked done when in fact I have not learned that lesson yet. Please don't do unnecessary reshuffling of your lessons just leave it as it is. -You updated again and my lessons reshuffled again. It is getting annoying."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's adequate. I gave the free trial a shot, and was going to probably subscribe soon, but I have noticed that the lessons were all easy enough during the Super, but as soon as you aren't paying and you're limited on how many mistakes you can make without paying for premium, it starts throwing things at you to make sure you fail, to ensure you have plenty of incentives to give them money. And of course the 'practice your mistakes' mode is not a free feature. Pretty scummy tactics."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The Duo app is very engaging and easy to use with bite-sized lessons. Your quests depend on how much time you spend on the app,so it's never too difficult to finish. And you can learn multiple languages at once. However,some African languages on here would be nice too. As well as lessons on interchangeable words (such as using proper prepositions with expressions)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Updated unexpectedly and completely reorganized the lesson plans, throwing me into a unit where I was totally unprepared. Now I have to start over, because the earlier lessons contain vocabulary that wasn't trained pre-update, but it still counts this as ""review"" (even though I never got to learn it before), which awards a measly 5xp per lesson. Absolutely aggravating."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I cannot recommend, it seems there is zero upkeep, nobody fixes bugs. They just keep inventing more gamification. When you get after the first few sections, the audio is broken and not playing (spanish and russian), the language specifics are not taken into account (polite and normal form in Spanish is impossible to guess from English and others). And what really broke the game is some lessons don't even load so you can't continue (Vikram's radio i.e.) in Spanish, Do not pay for this low quality"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is generally a great, fun way to learn. However, I had a maddening experience. I was unable to complete a level because the acceptable answer continued to change, as a scene was enacted where a person was asking for more coffee. The question asked where this person was. Bar, restaurant, and cafeteria were each answers at different times. I burned several hearts and gems to complete, yet if I did not guess the correct answer at that given time (with no context), I was wrong. Unacceptable"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"User interface designed for 3-year old todlers. The app looks cute, but its overdone to a point where it is counter intuitive. Please give users an option with a less ""cutified"" and more ""to the point"" template for easy and fast navigation. Also, the Settings are not easy to find. Too many animations and notifications interupting your flow. And at the end of every speedrun, the app stalls (animations disabled in settings)."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"For the most part it's okay. I never had any issues up until yesterday/today when I noticed that with some of the Spanish exercises they are blatantly pronouncing the INCORRECT answer. Thought it was me at first, had to hit ""repeat"" multiple times just to be sure. Holding the speaker right next to my ear and listening at slower speeds is when I confirmed that it was in fact the wrong answer being pronounced."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"More game than learning tool. Essentially a match game for language. I have a really good ear so I'm getting a lot of ""correct"" answers, but I don't feel like I'm learning a language. Some of the phrases are RIDICULOUS and would never be in any normal conversation. Most importantly there is NO conversation. It doesn't facilitate you actually SPEAKING the language. I don't find it helpful. Pimsleur is way better."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a good app that makes learning a language fun, and I feel I have come on quite far in the six months I have been using it. My major criticism centres around glitching points system. It says I will get double points then doesn't give them, or says I will get higher points on a level up but just gives regular points. And I have recently discovered that my friend who has the app on her iPad gets more than double the points I can for the same lesson. üò§ Not fair when we compete in leagues."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's UI is nice and easy to understand, and I'm sue It's great for someone just visiting a country for a week, but as someone who wants to gain a a fundemental understanding of the language it just isn't for me. It meerly teaches you words and sentences rather than grammar and word structure. Good luck learning words on your own, because it does not give you the tools to do so. For anyone who's wondering, I've been learning German on an 11 day streak with around 20 lessons complete."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Tried for 1 week and made significant progress, but im completely unable to use the voice features as it doesn't work on my Galaxy Note 20 Android. I've tried everything on my own to resolve, but no use. I would give 5 stars, but for the reliance on Google voice features. Sadly, I received no assistance from the Help team although I submitted 2 tickets. It's still usable without the voice features, but missing the satisfaction of having some perfect lessons."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is really well made. I personally picked German to learn and the category of learning EDUCATION. It was having almost the same format of teaching as another language for which I had formal education. This goes to show how legitimate the app is. Though I am quite annoyed of the ads, I will not spend any kind of money on an app. But it is really nice that one can get the premium version for free by progressing (though occasionally)."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Love the learning experience and the lessons are really good at teaching vocabulary and entering into long term memory. It has boosted my confidence in speaking a different language to native speakers. Only reason this isn't getting 5 stars is because the match madness exercises are purely made to make money off the user. It's virtually impossible to complete a level 2 or 3 match madness without purchasing a row blaster or a time extension. Everything else is fantastic!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is Woke The app is colorful, and the exercises are fairly simple and intuitive. But you can't even learn Spanish without being bothered by a woke political agenda. The female narrator wants you to translate: ""My wife rides horses very well."" Really? There's not even an option to skip. I do my Spanish lessons with our children. Unacceptable. Duolingo won't get another dime from me, not even from extra ads."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The free version is not allowing users to learn anything as curious as before. I know times are changing, everyone wants to make money but what's the point if you are losing the users in order to gain money... This was the best app for learning a new language (which is rare now a days) but it went down as soon as the premium version came in (super duo)."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, its a great tool, I would have given it 5 star but for some reason the maths and music courses aren't available on my phone but I have the latest update and a friend of mine has both the maths and music courses however I don't. I would really appreciate if you could look in to both of there issues, thanks üòä"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Love this app. Forgivable manipulation and gamification at its best. Learned so much! But on my 20 day streak in Chinese, suddenly, 80% of the course content changed. I was demoted half a unit, and I'm told I've completed lessons for words I've never learned. I don't know who's daft idea it was to move the goal posts so far without a heads-up, but it's a jarring experience and makes me nervous to continue investing time in it. Better write down all the stuff I can remember so I don't lose it!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,this is wonderful it has helped me learn the basics of korean vocabulary though I would recommend using other things along with it if you want to be fluent in the language you are taking. No person can learn everything from one thing. So I would recommend this as supplemental material or other ways of studying or if you want to be familiar with a language. I give it a 5/5 stars though. I highly recommend it.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When you get something wrong, they don't offer an explanation why it was wrong or explain the grammar behind it. They're basically like, no. Try again. I don't like that there's no lessons, they just throw new stuff at you repeatedly and figure it'll eventually stick. This method takes so much longer than if we actually understood how the language works."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Generally fun, but they provide no support for bugs and the vocab review feature is basically non existent. After two months of studying Russian, it says I've been introduced to ~400 words. Yet if I use the ""review your words"" feature, it only shows me the same ~10 words. I've completed an entire new section, yet it won't let me review any new words, which is really infuriating. I reported this problem, but of course it's been ignored. I'll revise my rating if this is ever fixed."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"While I'm happy with the format of the app, the review part needs some work. I could play it a hundred times and nothing would change. The reviews only show me lessons I've learned recently and I'm starting to forget the basic words from the beginning of the course. Every course or platform is a completely different experience too. Web has the vocab which I would love to do on the app but tough luck, I've heard of events I've never even seen on my course, and quests are different on web and app"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Its still good, however, one of the later choices has seriously diminished the experience. They ""simplified"" the lesson plan, letting you no longer choose which lessons you want to take and in what order. Instead youre forced to do exactly their path. This often forces me to do lessons in topics im already strong at, leading to a feeling that I am wasting my time, which made me stop using the app. I recommend one of its competitors, like babbel or coursera instead."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app has become increasingly more money hungry, as it hides features behind pay walls and ups the amount of adds to the point where I have to close and reopen the app after every lesson if I don't want an ad. The problem is, when I close and reopen the app, it doesn't save my streak or say I earned any exp. So even when I have done 10+ lessons in the past few days, the leader board says I only earned 28 exp. It also hasn't said I did any lessons in the past 2 days."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've had Duolingo for a few years now. Unfortunately, I lost all my phone data and, with it, the password to get in. Their system does not work properly. I've tried to reach out to Duolingo countless times, and no one has helped me. I paid a subscription, and I can not even use it. I requested a refund, denied. Worst customer service. I wish they cared for the app users much more."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've had Duolingo almost a year now. While it's very helpful to learn words and some grammar, nothing is explained as to WHY certain grammatical rules are the way they are. Having explanatory tips like that would be very helpful. A for the the match cards, they serve more to stress the user out because of such short timeframes. Instead of leaving an opportunity to properly match the words and put that to memory, users are forced to connect what can be seen as fast as possible."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used to absolutely love this app...not so much now though. As others have said, it does not really cover structure or rules of grammar that would help you to learn better. Also, the older format was ALOT better. I do not like the new format at all. It makes it much harder to earn points for the league and has a lot of woke agendas thrown in...forget politics just help me learn!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I miss the older version. I understand incentivising for a paid version but it prioritises competition over learning. Anyone learning a language understands there are areas where we struggle. The best thing is to practise multiple times until we feel more comfortable. This option is mostly gone in the updated free version. Practising completed sections costs gems. Also, the league system pushes people to do more new lessons instead of reinforcing what's been learnt. Much less is retained now."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They updated it recently, at least the Chinese lessons, and added new words and characters in sections and units I've already completed in their entirety. This means I have to go all the way back to the beginners lessons just to learn new words that could've easily been placed in a newer, separate section. This is just counterproductive and frustrating because I like organization, and this just screwed over my pacing."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to be fun but recently seems to be full of people who must spend 24hrs a day on it. I cannot and get demoted to the lower league. One voice is so fast it's impossible to understand, as I struggle with some word recognition having many similar words in the choices boxes is very difficult. Again, the typing exercises are so difficult for dyslexic people, whole app seems to be against dyslexia sufferers. It has just started asking me to listen to subjects I have not even covered on home page"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After using the app for a while, I find that I want to switch off the typing of sentences in a new language, before I have had a chance to learn the sound, and meaning of them. I practice when I am tired, and close the app when it gives me no option to skip writing. There was one exercise I could do without typing, now there is none. So the app I have a year long subscription to is now not being used."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Whoever the team behind this learning platform, you guys are amazing! At first, I had doubts that the learning method in this app will ever work. However, I was wrong! I started to see the change in less than 40 days! I am now able to read some basic french, I know a lot of words and grammars, I can write some basic French! Once I get a solid grip to French, I'll start moving to Italian or Spanish. Duolingo team, you guys are amazing, thank you for such a learning opportunity!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I love the app but it keeps glitching and the widget tells me I've done my lesson for the day at like 10pm (i live on a very atypical sleep schedule) and then i go to do the next days lesson at like 3am and it says I've used a streak freeze. Has happened at least 10 times. Really frustrating. I mean I do lessons regularly enough that I'm not without a streak freeze for long but still annoying that the widget glitching is messing up my streak because I depend on it to tell me if I'm okay!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is AMAZING! I love how short each level is. Learn as much as you what, when you want, and how you want. I also like how when you start a language course you take a ""placement quiz."" That way if you have some prior knowledge of a language it can place you accordingly. Also the achievements and badges you can earn are motivating. :) Fantastic work, Duolingo!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I can't get into the app anymore. it just shows the green ""duolingo"" screen. I had to uninstall and reinstall, but that didn't help at all. one star until I figure out how to fix it. EDIT: I fixed it. Just had to go on the computer and get back into the account from there. It suddenly worked on my phone after that."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,this app is really good for learning the basics of a new language. but the narration is very annoying. it's impossible to listen to music while using the app. every time i start on a new question the narration will also decrease the volume of my music. they should have at least a function to disable the narration
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like the gamification because I'm an extremely competitive person. I also like that you have to use problem-solving to figure out what certain words and phrases mean. I have a degree in teaching English to speakers of other languages, and my students always say that learning English through immersion is very similar to what Duolingo tries to emulate through the problem-solving component. That said, you aren't going to become ""fluent"" using Duolingo. It's a good *supplement* for your study."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I didn't finish an entire course yet, but i would imagine the app wont teach you very advanced stuff. Although i must say that ive learnt more french in 2 weeks with this, than from my school teachers in 2 years. It makes it easy to start learning a language, though if youre really serious about it you should seek more advanced courses/resources after a while. Some aspects of the ui are not very intuitive, for example i did not realize that gem counter also acts as the shop button."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app however alot of the writing requires you to translate a sentence from eg Spanish to english instead of the opposite which would be just as if not more beneficial for learning a language. Also the notes for each level don't have a lot of explanation for why they use or change the form of something etc. Instead it's very basic & that could easily be expanded eg a table showing how a word changes form. Aside from those, really great app and highly recommend-my Spanish has improved hugely!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's good, but what makes this a stress is the lives you get when incorrect, I thought this was a learning app, not a testing app, I want to learn languages, not be tested every second with a second timer and a life counter, I wish there was a way of not dealing with that issue, I'm not a fast learner, my mind can only handle a certain amount of sentences before it gives up. Please just make a regular learning app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"bugs are getting better, but seems like theres an emphasis on spelling out specific locations (such as castles) I'll probably never see as im living in another country. Language learning should not be limited to spelling local (or specific) locations unless its an advanced class. still haven't even touched on past/future tense here yet."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I take back my word on saying it's a good app and instead of the former 4 stars, I'm giving it 1 star, I'd have given 0 star if it were possible. Even after updating it repeatedly, it keeps telling me I'm offline and as if that's not bad enough, it keeps closing repeatedly whenever I'm in the middle of a class and I can't reopen it no matter how many times I try. This is really disappointing. This is not the Duolingo I know and grew to love."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I want to give Duolingo a better review. I really do! It eases you into topics well and the repetition based learning is legitimately useful. But the Android app is so full of bugs that it's really frustrating. Sometimes the app will claim that you've won an XP boost for finishing a module only for it to never appear, other times your daily score just won't update or will just revert to what it was last time you opened the app. The list goes on. Good for teaching, but frustrating app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Every time a course update happens, I have to redo most units, and have legendary lessons with words I have never seen in my life. This just demotivates me from doing more lessons that one to save my streak. Please stop updating the courses like this and bring back discussions. ||| EDIT: They've just updated the chinese course and I lost all progress. Absolutely all except for the first ever lesson, the words of which I have never come across till now."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I wish I had more hearts, rarely any ads though there are some. IDK what type of conversation Duolingo thinks people are having but a can successfully say ""car is a spoon"" in French. I downloaded Duo because I'm in a French class and it does help to just review some words. I like that you can review lessons, having a streak is a goal and something that I personally look forward to. I do recommend this app!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy doing Duolingo it's just that it doesn't give me animations. also with my friend they actually have an avatar instead of just having a profile picture. When they open their settings to change what they want, back to the animations the only animation that works is why I get the double XP bottle. Also I can't follow people on Duolingo and some achievements that other people for some reason I don't earn the achievement or they don't give me the achievement, it's very annoying."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm a few weeks in, so here are my impressions. It's a simple and relatively fun way to learn. I think it could be improved with a larger vocabulary, more teaching of grammatical rules, less repetition of very easy question and exercises, and a little less tapping of the ""continue"" button. If you are reasonably knowledgeable of a language it may be too basic and boring for you, but otherwise, the quests, leagues, levels and constant rewards make it fun."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's fine, but it doesn't teach grammar properly. Neither does it accept many other options if you translate a sentence. Like, I've lived in Germany for my whole life so I obviously know german grammar. And I sometimes ""learn"" German/English to earn Xp, but it doesn't accept every sentence in german (even though it's completely correct and you can 100% say it that way too). It's really annoying, cause when you learn a language with many different grammar stuff, you should have more options."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoy duolingo but for the past few weeks the app has slowed WAAAAYY down. If you're trying to compete in the tournaments, time is an asset. Each of the Speak exercises that add XP points slows down to a CRAWL taking 1.5 to 2 MINS to complete vs the 45-55 SECONDS I usually clock. I've tried reaching out via Feedback in the app several times but only getting auto email reply. App is fully updated, RAM is cleared. Really hope you reply and fix this .. I will update when theres a fix"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, I am not very good at learning languages. So when I looked at this app I was pleasantly surprised. The bright and cheerful way to learn languages appeals to me, and games and stories feels very natural. My only complaint would be the app has ads frequently, (using the duolingo site bypassed them) & the loss of hearts when you get something wrong. I want to learn so I opted for super Duolingo subscription. No longer waiting for refill."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"If you care about the game experience (and I'm guessing you do or you wouldn't have picked this app), don't use Android. I've been steadily struggling to keep up in leagues with the same level of effort. From several weeks of top 3 diamond down to Obsidian and dropped again. Then someone pointed out you get less xp on each lesson on Android than iOS. I double checked on my iPad, I can get 20-30xp/lesson there with no bonus active. Same lesson, same time on my Android phone gets me 10xp."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It has been revised. It's more gamified and is more fun, but I think I'm missing the writing parts. Maybe they're coming up as I advance. I think this is a fun way to learn basic vocab and grammar. Of course, as with everything, you get more out of it if you put more time in. Fun, not magic! NB: Impossible to find pricing for premium plan. This info should be very easy to find. One star off."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app is good for learning basic words and hearing the language spoken. However there are problems. 1) It says there is a keyboard to translate into the language but it's next to impossible to get it to show up. 2) They expect you to just pick up on different verb tenses without ever teaching them.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I totally love the app and the way you can learn a language! (Ok, maybe you could learn some basics earlier in the course) But overall I love it. Only 2 things I really hate are: the ""I can't listen now"" is on the wrong place, or you should confirm it. You tap it to easily when you go to the next question. And the 2nd thing...I personally hate the super duo Lingo. Once in a time I get a couple of days free....BUT I DON'T WANT IT, I HATE IT!!!! So please let us choose if you want it!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I think that Duolingo is a great app to learn a language. I think the thing that bugs me is that there isn't enough incentive to put a lot of effort into tournaments as a non-Super user. Yes, you receive more gems, but you rarely get free Super days. Also, they put you up against Super users. Yes, Super users paid for advantages, but having to compete against them is unfair and not reflective of the effort of the learner at all! It would be better if the tournaments were categorized."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"great for learning vocabulary, but the ""game"" design is very boring and poorly executed. gems have no purpose, and once you have achieved the top league once, there is no point to keep competing in the weekly ladders. once you've ""beaten the game"" you're just in it to maintain your streak, at which point it doesn't matter how much you practice. the quests and currency need to be better fleshed out, and there need to be more rewards. streak freezes and 2x xp just don't cut it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Some language courses need to be worked on (Haitian Creole). There is a clear difference between some of the language courses. Lessons are repetitive and at times confusing. For example, Haitian creole had around 5-6 different words for ""the"" and are all used differently. I would have never gotten pass unit 3 if I hadn't looked this information up because duo simply gives you the definition and not how it's used. Deff needs work >_>"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo, I like your app, I'm learning French, and I like it, you're app is amazing, I really like to learn a lot, but please, if you see this please put sign language to your app, I want to learn sign language, at least try to think about the people who cant communicate and hear, this can help them a lot and it can help us a lot. Thank you, duolingo. I'm gonna use this app every day. Have a nice day :)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"For a free app that helps you learn foreign languages, this is pretty good. It helps you learn by making games. Some of the content is a little obscure and not practical (learning the word for ""cat"" before ""I am going""), but the lessons are manageable and help a person become familiar with a foreign language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"For no reason at all, it keeps persistingly skiping speaking and listening exercises. I also can't currently continue my super subscribtion so, there really isn't any way for me to practice those listening and speaking exercises in the practice hub. If there is someway it could be fixed, I would really be glad. I really liked duo and this is just frustrating!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Although the app has improved dramatically in terms of how it teaches Japanese and allows you to practice what you have learned, the problem of forced engagement and burnout has also gotten a lot worse. They keep raising the goalposts for both daily quests and monthly challenges, and it really gets in the way of learning. Fix these problems and the app would be stellar! Also, I would really love to see Ch'orti, Yucatec, Nahuatl, Mvskoke, Ainu, Louisiana Creole, and Cajun added."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Duo is a good tool to learn a language. I've improved my sentence structures. The problem is that not enough grammar is taught or given in the hints to help with the lesson ahead. Why has the discussion button been removed, which was very helpful when I wasn't understanding the sentences & other uses explained why I was getting it wrong, invaluable. All duo does is mark the sentence in red with no explanation. Can't get gems anymore either, you use to watch an ad for them, disappointing üòï"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Fun video game, terrible way to learn a language. I'm over 400 days into an unbroken streak and consistently place in the leaderboards. Yet, I can't speak the language at all and can barely read signs when I visit. It offers no foundation into the grammar and rules of the language, offers little to no repetition or vocabulary building, not even flashcards. It's a fun video game but useless as a learning tool. I'd recommend try ANYTHING else."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Mostly ok, but annoying when the updates undo all all the legendary progress you've made. 26 units into a section and most now showing up as incomplete. Not just that, incomplete with stuff that not been that thoroughly covered. Doing this so regularly could potentially end up putting people off using the app. This is making me rethink whether to renew or not"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo has certainly improved a lot in the 2 years I've used it. There's still room for improvement with using your phone's mic in speaking lessons and it would be nice for it to show you what words mean when you are practicing hiragana more, not just on the odd occasion."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have an auditory processing disorder so I have a hard time with the spoken portions, but thankfully I can slow them down! My only complaints are that I don't know how to access the tips and tricks so I keep making small mistakes and losing hearts over it, and the leagues are kind of pay to win as well. I never thought I'd see a pay to win learning app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It went from feeling like the Duolingo owl was going to show up at my house and beat me, to being quite an enjoyable gamified version of learning a language. It's really helping, and whilst the adverts are many, most let you skip after a few seconds, and they're not as annoying as some other apps."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app works well, except it no longer gives me any rewards. If I complete a lesson without enough experience points to open a chest the ad will play. If I do a second lesson to open a chest the app freezes. When I quit and reopen the app (after waiting 2 to 3 minutes of perpetual loading following the lesson) it shows I've reached the points for the chest, but my gems haven't changed and I don't have another streak freeze. I'm pretty much perpetually stuck."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"If you use the paid for version or the free one you are still only dabbling in the language. I Would prefer that each language had its own points and hearts system, having one for all is disheartening. The app makes you learn lots of irrelevant things repetetively. It is not conversational at all, it is fairly usless at giving you a grounding or background or confidence in the language. But is user friendly and fun. So thats ok then."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The comments section had very useful tips on the language I was learning, and I browsed it often. It's been removed for whatever reason, and i think it should be re-added. Profile pictures have also been removed and replaced with avatars that are devoid of life. At least with uploaded photos, it felt somewhat like a person was on the other end of that username. The app is still fun, but updates have definitely made it worse."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Just a suggestion, why don't you add audio on the English words??? its ok, but I'm just saying this could really improve Duolingo for me and I bet for many others too... If this is done I would be really thankful... Otherwise, this is a really awesome app, and I really love the progress I have been able to make on this app. Another thing is that it has the really nice friends and thing where you can friend and follow people, there are also leagues and leaderboards that I love."

A lot of courses I completed are no longer legendary status, and when I go to review them they're full of material I hadn't learned before. It'd be great if I could reset those courses so I can catch up on material fully"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The progression is very good. I like how we learn by using and reusing the same words and sentences. Learning grammar and rules is ok, but practice makes perfect right? Duo builds your reflexes so you know how to say something without having to first think about the rules. And it feels a bit like a game, so you want to do 'just one more'... :) Great app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Super sub is worth it. Cute design that really helps you learn and retain a new language. The latest update lets you see words you learned! Super happy!! The notes can be a bit disorganized, but I negate this problem by taking my own notes. There are a lot of things I love about this app. It's the only language course I've stuck to, I've found most language programs to be super dry and boring. Duolingo's gamification of language learning works for me!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's great! You get to learn a language. I'm learning Japanese üç°. They celebrate your progress. and others can too! They put it in the feed. there's a leaderboard so you can rank up! There's tips in the feed every few days. There's cool fun things they do in it as well. Or XP ramp - ups sometimes. You can get a streak, I'm around the 60 streak. I recommend this game üòÅüéØ"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a good app, been using it for over a year. The format and usability are excellent. The introduction of new vocabulary is too slow, about 6 new words a unit, each unit has about 30, 5-8 minute lessons. I do a couple a day, a unit takes me a couple of weeks. 6 words in 2 weeks is not nearly enough, becomes very repetitive. I use DuoCards to learn new words."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been doing Japanese on and off for years now, but really started taking it seriously this time. The app is great and I understand why there's ads after each lesson, honestly would just buy super because that's also great. I do think the leaderboards are a little unbalanced with everyone learning a different language at a different level, some people are way too advanced for it to be fair. My issue is, the words I was given in my Japanese lesson did not match what the voice was saying."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"As of March 21, 2024 I noticed you guys removed a very essential part of learning the Chinese language from the app. Hanzi I think it was where you trace the characters. This is not a good move for English speaking learning or any language that uses alphabet. Drawing the picture for the word or sound really helped identify it. I would like to see that portion come back"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Thank you for fixing the past error regarding the practice. When I entered yesterday to the app, it notified me that the Mandarin course was updated, then I make a new lesson and it shows me the same characters that I saw three exercises ago; however, the fact that when I wanted to practice to win hearts, I got characters that I never learned and that the app marked my answer wrong because I don't know them, that is unfair. Could you do me a favour and tried to fix that error please? Thank you."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I thought this app was great, and was great for a good long time. I had the yearly subscription for 2 years or so. My children were also using this app. However, I cancelled it after they started pushing the LGBT agenda in the lessons. It was very discouraging. I cancelled it and will never use it again. I will never recommend this app , especially to those who have children. It's unacceptable. Use Ling instead."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Cute animation, although I wish Duolingo has put more effort into the content. I have paid for the full year of Ukrainian, but ran out of lessons in just one month. Poor selection of words and phrases, teaching me words that are the same in every language: file, Skype, business, jazz, and names such as Linda and Mark - over and over again. Ad nauseam! Emphasis is on the wrong syllable most of the time and no intonation whatsoever. No way to look up an antonym to a word. Sorry, do not recommend."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This App no longer works on my phone. I uses my phone data but it doesn't work, all it keeps showing was you are offline.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It will destroy your life if you're competitive! It's not really self-paced. I wish there were two modes, one solely for learning and the other for learners who enjoy competition. I sometimes feel as if I'm on a treadmill that never stops. I've no doubt learned a lot, and it was fun for a while, but I'm leaving soon because Duolingo takes up so much of my time if I strive for the top 3 spots every week."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Really doesn't teach you the fundamentals of a language or WHY certain things are the way they are, but it used to do that sometimes! That's my main issue with it! The app seems to keep getting more gameified and worse over time. If I'm learning a language, I need fundamentals before I can even attempt to learn conversation. Also, their use of AI is stupid and embarassing. Pay real translators."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The stories will sometimes freeze at the end after pressing continue and does not complete the excercise. It doesnt matter if you write a response or not. I will normally start my day reviewing a story. When it doesn't complete, I will let it, run hoping it will finish and give me my points and my afternoon xp boost, but this doesnt always happen. Today I let it process 8 hrs."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Awesome app. I have earned up to a 68 day strike! The graphics, (which don't really matter) the voices\sounds, are all amazing. But, the downside is really how much Super and Max cost. The family plan for Max is I'm pretty sure over $200. I mean who would pay for that??!!! IF you have never tried Max or Super, it gives you a 2 week free trial. For Max I think it gives you a 2 day free trial. Sometimes (if your lucky), you get a free trial in a chest. I hope this helped! :3 :D I surely reccomend"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I am learning two languages, Spanish and Hebrew. The Spanish portion is great. The Hebrew portion of the app seems incomplete- not being able to click on a work and hear it as well as the slower speech function (turtle) doesn't seem to work at all. I need a lot more help in the listening portion of my Hebrew."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"On the one hand, the application helped me significantly with learning hiragana and katana. on the other hand, due to addictive mechanics, I devoted more time to maintaining my position in the league, almost completely excluding learning something new. After I went to another country, I connected to another version of the application and it was simply overwhelmed with advertising"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Single units have become ridiculously long, with 20+ exercises. Also, IOS has always had many more kinds of exercises compared to Android. Maybe after a couple of years it would also be time to expand Android's questions and whatnot? It is so boring to do always the same 3 exercises and sentences, repeated over and over. Not a very effective way of learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"‰Ω†Â•Ω! I'm learning mandarin! The only gripe I have is that if the course content changes, IE: Unit 2 now talks about music and lawyers, and you go back to do the review tests for the stars, it does not bridge the gap by introducing the new words. It just expects you to know them. At higher level, it is riddled with people that auto complete lessons for leaderboards. Why though.... I would love to help the developers prevent this."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The latest update to the Japanese lessons has seen me put at a level higher than I should be at. Now I'm having to review previous levels cause I'm not understanding and it isn't the same as learning. I've missed out on a lot. Moreover, was excited to join super duolingo next month because I was learning many kanji words and I needed to be able to review them as many times as possible. The updated lessons feature more of hiragana which isn't really enticing. Please review these changes."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My experience with this app is great, but whenever I input the words, they sometimes shuffle around. Also, during the listening session, sometimes you don't even understand what the AI is saying even in turtle mode. I will continue to use the app until I find a better app to learn a language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely hate the competitive aspect of a leaderboard. I just want to learn a language. but I hate more when the app suddenly forgets the progress I made or deletes all the xp I gained. I will find another language app and delete this one without a second thought, because it's not worth it. Duolingo will never get my money"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The app is great and in fact the reminder notifications are wonderful. But where I do have a problem is in those stories where a man's girlfriend is a man and where a woman's boyfriend is a woman. I am not comfortable with it and I think there are others also who are not comfortable learning with these concepts in place. I would be grateful if there can be a way one can choose to filter that off. Thanks
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a really good app. I hope they can diversify the Vietnamese program they have. They only focus on the Northern accent. If they could split it between North and South, that would be helpful. I also think there should be more speaking practice opportunities to really target pronunciation in a language with such intricate phonology. As a Korean learner of 10 years, I must say the Korean program is extremely difficult and needs improvement."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Don't like the last update, unnecessary gimmick added at the end of each lesson that waste three seconds each time. It's not a game, get rid of it. Even with the animation switched off in the settings, it still shows, it's very annoying. Yes you can show me the xp and time, no need for all that, I'm a superuser and I want to have the option as a paying user to not see that. Or else it's bye bye. Remove it and I remove this review."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great for learning a little bit of a language (no fluency but for sure some basic knowledge). My only two issues are that it is hard to know when plural you and when singular you is used without getting a hint. It'd be nice if that could be clarified somehow. The other is that there is no section for grammar whatsoever which makes it incredibly hard to learn specifically verbs and their conjugations. Instead you learn every verb-form as its own word. It doesn't give any rules what to do.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"They restructured the Japanese language course and threw me into a whole new Section that assumes I know a lot of words that I haven't learned yet. I can barely progress following the new lesson structure and I don't even know which lessons I should go back to. An option to revert back to the older structure, at least until I finish the section I was originally on would be nice."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Excellent app with a wide variety of languages and especially good for beginning to learn those with scripts different from Latin. Even the free version is sufficient. It's a versatile tool that's as good as your ability to use it. It's so good that's it's even a favourite among those who like to bash other apps and platforms inorder to promote their own.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Considering this program is free, it is really excellent, a genuine example of something for nothing. For me, the only other program or software comparable would be Gmail. Duolingo is that useful. As an English teacher, I suggest this is very good for vocabulary building, basic grammar, so reading and to some extent listening. Speaking OK too, writing only from a higher level of knowledge."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Have been using this app for more than a year. Really appreciate being encouraged in the daily lesson(s) habit. It has dramatically improved my vocabulary, but not often my ability to understand local native speakers, at least not yet. I usually ask them to repeat slowly. I speak a little, haltingly. Glad to have the app and keep trying. I wish it automatically included the noun's gender when introducing the new word and reinforced noun gender more often in the practices. Fun way to learn."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good for adding vocabulary, although sometimes not as relevant as one might like. For example, after level one I can say 'My neighbour is timid', which could come later in the course with some more frequently used vocabulary learned earlier on. I feel this would give me more of a sense that I am actually achieving something."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The leagues or levels makes one want to win so it lends to cheating oneself or rushing through it. I like to write out lessons when I'm learning. I dont want to rush through. So I could care less what league I'm in anymore. It is so distracting when you are told that you dropped a level and it wasnt even your goal to begin with! What happened to being able to practice old steps? Now one needs Super just to practice past material??? How do I turn off all the league BS? Not good for deep learning.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've studied Spanish off & on throughout my adult life, from high school, thru college & beyond. I have never been able to learn so quickly & retain all the info so easily, while having fun, than I have with DUOLINGO. My only complaint about the free app is that some of the ads can be way too long & annoying. But it is free, so I can't complain too much."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app is great but course progress is super buggy. Multiple times my course progress got all messed up telling me I completed courses I haven't or telling me I haven't completed courses that I have. I even deleted one language so I could start over and today it is telling me that I completed the whole first section when I haven't even completed the first unit. It is super aggravating to just lose my progress constantly and not know what lesson I last left off. Please fix these bugs.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Im having such a good time on this app. It's both educational and fun. ( as someone who gets bored pretty easily, so this especially helps). It's also colourful and interactive. It helps you set goals for yourself and encourages you to keep going. Also, the adds aren't really a problem. They ( adds) usually come in after every level has been completed and it doesn't take away from the learning experience at all. 10/10 would recommend üòä"

I'm learning japanese and I'm getting quite good at speaking so this app definitely deserves 5 stars üåü..there might be 1 ad coming but it doesn't affect the learning cause its not too much disturbing and the 1 ad if for getting super duolingo so we can learn better!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Consistently getting worse and worse over time. 1) Language courses are riddled with incorrect/incomplete or non-sensical translations. 2) No real people are monitoring feedback for the courses. 3) Because of 2) there are no way to express feedback for 1). 4) Artificial delays and unskippable animations are added to waste more of your time on the app. 5) Helpful social features are consistently getting removed to make your experience worse, instead added useless features like avatar constructor."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like doing maths on Duolingo as I struggle with maths a lot and Duolingo helps me but I think it is very unfair as I have to use a completely different phone to do it on. So I think that you should have the same features on android. I also think that you should maybe add extra hearts, not everyone has enough money for super Duolingo and to learn properly you have to make mistakes. The practice option could be improved if by practicing when you lose hearts you can gain more than five."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Alright but doesn't really give you fluency. There is a tendency to play tjd game rather than learn effectively. It is not the only way you should learn, i tale weekly lessons also. Im trying to learn Spanish but it predominantly teaches you south American Spanish (despite the Spanish flag) which is very different. It should have an option for proper Spanish."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I really like this app as it has improved my other language skills SO much! But I wish I could turn off the weekly leaderboard thingy, because my life is pretty hard and busy these days (I still wanna keep my streak) and I dont have the time to get that much ""XP"", and its really stressing that im always just falling off to the previous league. Moral of the story: Can you please add an option to turn off weekly leaderboards? üíö"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Super great! I was enrolled in a Chinese dual emersion a few years back, and I got Duolingo to help stay on top of it when I moved. It worked wonders, but I was a little disappointed that it didn't teach me how to write new characters. I know that lost languages you learn are not character based, but it would be a nice feature I hope to see in the future. ---UPDATE--- They added the ability to draw Chinese Hanzi! This is a feature that makes studying well worth it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I started back in november and found that, although not perfect, i was learning. The main issue why i stopped is because I was loosing lives over small mistakes or simply by showing me new words that ive never seen. After 5 lives you had to wait 4 hours to get 1 back, forcing you to either be very slow on your progress or quitting. But now, you can do small revisions and gain 1-2 lifes back watching an add. Great stuff, i love this implementation. Makes it much more rewarding"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I paid for a subscription, so I have high expectations for this application. So far, I've only had two issues. I was completing lessons but was not able to access the leaderboard. Next, while in a lesson, I was not allowed to type my answer and had to submit blank, which gave me an incorrect answer. I hit the flag icon to report. Hopefully, these issues do not become frequent."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to use the app all the time but since all these ads started to pop up after every single lesson, I started to use it less and less beacsue it isn't about learning how to improve your language as much anymore. And I really wish that Duolingo could stop forcing the super Duolingo down our throats all the time, it has gotten more about advertising than helping us in prove in language learning. PLEASE REMOVE THE UNNECESSARY THINGS!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Really helpful for language learning and good for encouraging daily learning. Slightly centred on the Americas as I learned Portuguese only to realise that some words were different as Duolingo had focused on Brazilian Portuguese rather than European Portuguese. Also the English translations are in American English so are slightly different. It generally is very helpful though and a fun way of learning.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have been using the app for more than three years to learn Japanese. At first it was great. More recently it's gone downhill for a couple of reasons. Most importantly, the community forums are gone now. That means you don't get to hear what's currently popular in speech, and it removes interaction with people from the language. Also the explanatory lessons are now quite sparse and difficult to find so a lot of context is missing. Another problem the forums used to solve."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Such a fun and easy way to learn languages for free. Especially for beginners like me who is learning European languages. Even without premium subscription, ads do not get in the way much. Keeps me wanting to take multiple lessons in one go while I have the time. So far it has been worthwhile spending time with this app as it never bores."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I would've happily given Duolingo 5 stars as I really enjoy it had they not completely ripped me off. they advertise the 2 week trial of Superduolingo by saying that they will alert you 2 days prior to the trial ending so you can decide if you want to keep it or not before you are charged. well they never sent me any notices. not in the app, not in my email, nada. so I didn't realize until a few days later that it was past the trial date & by then I was charged $85. don't do the ""free trial""!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have the paid version, learning Japanese & Chinese. It's quite good overall but I think there are too many revision exercises that are based on speed and not enough to entrench the vocabularies. There are no speaking exercises in Japanese (up to S2) and in Chinese, there are quite a few voice / speaking exercises that do not work. There are no writting exercises. Some exercises don't make sense e.g. a 6 years old university student?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The web version on PC is honestly better. Let's say you translate a sentence but got two or more words that are directly beside each other in the wrong positions, instead of just being able to drag them to their right positions, you have to remove all the words after the error and re insert them again as opposed to just DRAGGING the wrongly placed words to their right positions which is really convenient on my PC which I don't use as often. It would be really nice if this can be integrated üòá"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The quality of the french course is getting worse with every update. The french being taught is often incorrect and the sentences are clunky and unnatural. It is obvious that Duo is being cheap and using AI, rather than actual speakers of those languages. I am currently a super member, but will not be renewing as I no longer trust what I am being taught."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Thank you for making me competitive and utilizing my love for games in the most productive way. The app is perfect for learning any popular language in the most simplified and fun manner. Just one problem, the app shows ""You're offline"" sometimes and spontaneously even when my mobile data is working perfectly on other apps like Google. Kindly fix this, thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love using this app to learn Spanish but I feel like it rarely actually teaches me and relies solely on repetition. Which is fine, I just wish it taught me based on common mistakes. Also, I just completed 5 levels during a double XP time and it didn't count any of my points on the leaderboard??? Can this get fixed??"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I'm multilingual using Duo to learn Korean from scratch. Effective language learning tool if you allow yourself to follow the gaming approach. An improvement would be to allow a separate sound control for the milestone tunes - they are louder than the app speech and embarrassing when using away from home. Have an option to lower the milestone sounds and/or switch them off in away from home mode. Thanks!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a fun refresher game to do alongside learning a new language, and I appreciate that the only ads I'm getting are for their other services. But while doing these exercises, I'm often thrown words that I haven't been taught in the Duo lessons, and I do think that while the lesson guides are helpful to some extent- they don't necessarily cover everything in the lessons. It can be a bit vague."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a pretty good learning tool, my only suggestions are that they teach more useful and simple conversion at first like ""Hey, how are you"" and ""I'm doing fine, and you?"" for simple back and forth conversion. Also I'd suggest that they add more complex languages such as Thai and Cantonese, I really wanna learn Thai and with the tools in Duolingo it wouldn't be difficult if only they had that language as an option :( anyways, pretty good app"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING This has helped me learn multiple languages at one time. I have had the pleasure of enjoying this app for long time. It even has a character customization in which it is very diverse (in which it is not hard to believe because it is a language learning app) and did I add it has VARIOUS languages. some languages I didn't even know about, and get this, they are always working to add more. AMAZING. If you don't have this app, thats unfortunate because you are missing out."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Not particularly logical, new concepts introduced at random. Very childish in places and not helpful with learning grammar. I still don't understand the rewards system. Irritatingly frequent reminders to practice. If I was starting a language from scratch, I think I'd find it difficult with this app, and I wouldn't pay to use it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It used to be an amazing app, but since they removed the option to discuss sentences with other users, I've noticed that my learning pace has significantly slowed down. I gained so much insight from other people's explanations, and now it feels like I'm just memorizing sentences without truly understanding the grammar or vocabulary choices. Sometimes I try to look things up online, but it's frustrating compared to the convenience of having it just a click away like before."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Lots of bugs in interface where messages doesn't allow user to progress, (no button or hidden) (message overlaying choices) only option to quit. Need to clean up the interface guys. I'm currently learning Japanese, the voices sound a little unnatural. The principles are good. The learning curve is good. Just frustrating when you hit a bug."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I think this app would be better if there was a more clear overview of what you are learning. The new path system leaves me feeling lost, especially since half the lessons in the current section dont have anything to do with the section. Not to mention the new ""course refresher"" lessons create a ton of friction when trying to come back from breaking a streak. Maybe if I devoted more time to Duo, but I was under the impression this was supposed to be incremental and that's what I liked."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's definitely not worth the $155+ annual subscription cost. I sincerely hope no one is paying that. It isn't even worth the 60% off rate. The app developers have gone mad. There are so many bugs. And ads are now after every single lesson and getting longer. It used to be one ad every 2-4 lessons. The new interface is awful and reset progress for tons of users. Also the quests do not update correctly and you'll frequently not get credit for completing them.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"User beware! I used it and tried the free trial of Super Duolingo. It definitely has advantages over the non-subscription base, like unlimited messups. It reminded me trial period would be over in 2 days, so I changed the subscription in app so it would cancel. Well, it didn't and in 2 days I was getting billed the $89 for a year subscription (no refunds). Not happen Apparently you have to cancel it in the Google Play Store. Overall, it's a decent app and it helped learn the language some."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This language learning app is amazing! I love how I can choose between using a plan or not, I can learn at my own pace, and they always motivate me to learn every day and keep my streak growing. Learning spanish in school was a struggle, but now I can enjoy it and correct my mistakes. And the adds I feel are very minimal, so I only focus on my quick but rewarding lessons."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I can't get enough of Duolingo! This app has revolutionized the way I learn languages. The interactive lessons, engaging exercises, and friendly interface make learning a new language a breeze. Whether it's brushing up on basics or diving into more advanced topics, Duolingo has it all. The gamified approach keeps me motivated, and the bite sized lessons fit perfectly into my daily routine. Plus, the variety of languages available ensures there's always something new to explore."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"As someone who used it as a way to stop playing completely mindless phone games on my phone, I think it works pretty well, with the heart system stopping me from going too long. When compared to other mobile games it holds up pretty well, the ads aren't too invasive but they push the membership a lot. Main issues are that leaderboard and match madness are pay to win. Plus, it doesn't teach much, the sentences sound fake, and the placement tests are broken. It's annoying at times but pretty good"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"March 18th, 2024. What just happened with this update?!?! I was learning Chinese, now there is a total mess. Sections have changed units, yet supposedly I have them up to gold, there is so much new characters in those ""mastered"" parts that I don't even know what to do (except that I know I have to reset all my progress till now and star again)... After the update even lessons stopped working properly, there is no progress on them."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"not all language cover speaking. difficult to learn because there is no explanation for errors, just the answer. must still have a grammar book no matter what is said. silly competition that is rigged with dummy players an bugs in computing extra points... distraction from being seriouslearning, especially the paid upgrade...don't, not worth the money unless you are gaming the system!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Pros: - gamification: they nudge you to do your exercises daily. - baby steps: you can even learn a language with little daily investment. Helped me a lot in Italy Cons: - German they have a strange word order in sentences and only one option is accepted. - small things, such as ""auf Arbeit"" sound like they want you to use eastern German slang, which is so annoying and sounds horrible for the rest of Germany - English they expect you to guess the gender of people or singular/ plural"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app for learning new language, but it's really frustrating they've removed the option to view all the words you've learnt. So there's no way to quicky see your progress. Seems really ridiculous. Everything is geared towards making you want to pay for super also, which I won't be, so will see how long I use it for"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Overall an ok app for very beginners...the app has a glitch in listening despite correct pronunciation (only for '50 euros' and '10 euros' in Italian-my pronunciation is perfect as I speak Spanish, but it won't accept it no matter how many times I repeat it! ) No opportunity for continuous dialogue. I think this is the biggest downfall. No opportunity to print lessons. I've tried contacting support but no response."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,App is great for staying consistent with language learning. I just wanna say that they added a new feature recently where you can refill your xp boost for 100 gems. Neat. But I wish there was a confirmation before purchasing. I was almost done my lessons for the moment but I accidentally hit the purchase button while rushing through lessons. A waste of 100 hard earned gems that could've been easily prevented
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"His app can be good to help you practise a language. Don't think that this would teach you the language, it will not. You need a Basic knowledge to benifit from using it. Not all languages are equal, I find French good, but German is really poor, there is no help or guidance. It appears as though the French language course has been created by a team that have America English in their 2nd language, the English is frequently quite odd / poor."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I decided to come back to practice, because why not, and it's making me ""re-learn"" ÌïúÍ∏Ä! Í∑∏Î¶¨Í≥† ÏÜåÎ¶¨Í∞Ä ÌãÄÎ†∏ÏäµÎãàÎã§. So why would I want to start from the WRONG beginning again? This is a massive design flaw. FAIL FAIL FAIL. I am so glad my friends agree this app is not worth their time. Also there's a great video of a guy correcting the grammar this app uses for lessons."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"So, I'm learning Korean. Duolingo is alright but I think its more useful with vocabulary. When it comes to the listening, sometimes there is nothing to hear and of course the answer given is automatically wrong since you don't hear anything. I like the idea of the leagues but at the same time, I don't. It almost seems to take away from the purpose of learning and makes it a priority to be in competition with others instead of learning. Overall, good app but I like the old version better."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Really good except I'm encountering an issue which doesn't allow me to progress to the next lesson without restarting the app, and it's really bothering me having to restart every lesson. Every time I finish, it just prompts the same level again and I'm not sure why, it didn't always do this but now it's every time."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"this is actually a really great app! my only problem is the animations. they seem too sensitive. if i leave the app running in the background for too long, all animations and special fx stop working. then i have to go to settings and clear my data, which is an annoying process (i usually have to reset my settings). so, duolingo, can you please fix this problem? it would be greatly appreciated."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It was great until I discovered offline lessons are not a thing anymore. I will be offline while travelling for a few days, duolingo would have been perfect during down time before going to bed, but I guess it won't be possible. It was a thing in 2021, now it only download a miserable number of lessons that you will complete in half an hour maximum. Would be a 5 stars if not for that ridiculous decision."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is a very good app for learning but there are so many things that annoy me. First is that when in accidentally press ""learn new language"" it doesn't let me go out of it. And every time I close the app and open it again it stays the same. 2. When I press the button ""back"" on my phone it shows me the logo of duolingo to go to home and then it stays like that. It freezes everytime. 3. Although the game has many languages I do wish there would be the lanuage Maltese. Even though its unpopular."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"the application freezes quite often, some voices are incomprehensible at times (they speak very fast), it has maintenance breaks right when one is given a time boost, which is not too often, and one has to compete with the upgraded version of Duolingo's users, leading to upheavals to even maintain a decent position within any league, but mostly within the Diamond one, given all the ads and the lower points one can accrue using the free version. As good as it gets! Thank you üòä üôèüèª"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very useful app to learn a new language. You can use Super (Premium) if you don't want ads and get unlimited lives. Duolingo teaches languages in a fun and interactive way. But if you select the wrong answer you'll lose 1 life. You can compete with other people in Tournament and complete tasks together with friends.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The best app for learning language. Which is Duolingo. It's so fun to learn and incredible. So you should download Duolingo too. Here there are no ads but if you want like more Treasures or things you can watch some ads. But the amazing thing is that the ads are like advertisements for their own app,Duolingo. They teaches us like we are playing. For me it's the best app for learning language and I like it a lot. I am learning German language but you can pick any language you like. It's great!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the way there are no lessons as such. You just work through the exercises. I'd change two things. The noises when doing speaking exercises are too loud and annoying, especially for other people in the room. Also I'd like to be able to choose what day to have happy hour. I often work Saturdays. But minor quibbles. This is fantastic. My kids love using it. And I do."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"generally very good though it moves pretty rapidly and the revision options aren't great, so progress feels rapid but retention is poor. having to be creative in ways of going back over stuff, but I use it as an accompaniment to structured taught lessons - and it's generally pretty fun too."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"User for 3+ years and I have over a 1000 day streak, the only reason I haven't deleted it. The app is unusable at this point. Last update dropped the max amount of points you can earn on free to 15, practice or not unless you have a booster, making it near impossible to level up now. The amount of force closes and glitching is unacceptable. They forced a free trial that I don't want, no glitches or force closing suddenly. Shows they do it to push you to buy a subscription. It's infuriating."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I cannot deny Duo. I take time off and then I get curious and reach back out. It's when Duo starts to ask me to come back and practice that I end up doing the free week and it turns into a purchase. I used to think purchasing the app was expensive, but after I did, I found it to be of more value to myself and helpful to customer interactions at work! I dig the Duo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Can't tell pronounciations apart. I'll pronounce something 5 times before it finally lets me pass. Edit: the voice recognition on this is a joke and it doesn't even put ones you got ""wrong"" into the wrong answers tab if you're just reviewing pronounciations which is one of the hardest things to do. I didn't even finish a sentence and it passed me! Sometimes it stops listening before you finish your sentence! Tricks you into using your points by popping up where you're about to click."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I am enjoying the app, but I think one easy thing that could be changed would be to include the names under the characters image in a story or conversation. I get the two characters mixed up when reading a story or conversation, because I forgot who's who. This confusion makes it hard to follow along, read, and comprehend the story, selecting the right answers as the story progresses."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I just love it when they cha ge the course most of the way through. Sat down to finish a level review and the thing is asking me vocabulary and grammer I've never seen before. Ai content is bad. Voice lines are mid at best. I wanted to stick it out and finish the course but since they've pulled the rug on me here I'm not keen on that. There are better apps, I'd reccomment Hello Chinese if you're looking at Mandarin."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The system is good as it creates a cometition and helps motivate. What's lacking is detailed explainations of grammer. As well it allows, for example, a simplified phrase in one exercise but then in another execrise considers it wrong and expects a more formal phrase with no obvious rational reason. There is also no reason given to necessarily use one word over another when both can be used and it's then marked wrong."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Free (with ads) but of limited benefit. *For* Linearly structured learning. Repetitive drills. Help in reading, listening, and a little writing. *Against* Exercises: language very unnatural. Exercises: lack coherence. Useless words repeated ad nauseam (e.g. pingouin, trousse). Mistakes: many of my Italian corrections were accepted. French version is more obstinate; many of my evidently correct answers were marked incorrect. You won¬¥t learn language using Duolingo alone."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,No explanations for why your answer was not correct in most circumstances which means you don't learn the language so much as you learn which phrases duolingo likes. There is no flexibility in what you want to learn because each language only features one linear path to follow. More flexibility and more explanations would improve my motivation and ability to learn a language and make this app better.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo makes it fun and easy to learn a new language. The app does a good job of gamifying the learning and using other psychological tricks to make you stick with it. It's also fun and easy enough for my young kids to use and get excited about.

I have struggled through the first sections to get to the traveller section, expecting to find language I could use while travelling. Big disappointment, its just more complex constructions of totally pointless sentences. This was Greek."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"the only reason I do not rate 5 stars is because tracing characters (for these types of languages) is odd on a PC versus a mobile screen. it would be nice to have a chance to be warned before a tracing lesson, or have the option to do them later, similar to the listening exercises. everything else is great. love learning on this app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When I started to learn High Valyrian, I had never learned a language before. I am of Hispanic descent, hoping one day to learn Spanish and Latin. But after the multiple updates, and the lack of being able to learn the grammar, essential for learning a language. In none months I completed the HV course. But they changed it 3 times. Learning on discord that they had a guide but removed it. There are grammar rules that some of us need to learn. Why make an app for just gamers."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Overall good experience, but there are several aspects I don't think matches pedagocial best practice. One, there should be a dedicated easy-to-access narrow review on e.g. vocab and grammar. Two, most words are only seen in their specific unit; it would be more effective for learning if most words are reintroduced later. Spaced revision is more effective for retention and recall. Three, each unit is too repetitive; fixing the above also fixes this, but the steps can be split into intro/review."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love it. I can practice to talk, to listening and writing. Is so easy and fun. but the way I'm 64 years old and I have much fun to learn and check my own mistakes. the pronunciation is easy, and I can listen to myself and repeat as many times as I feel acceptable. I recommend it to everyone to care to improve their English."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, it will literally learn you a language in a fast way, it also has examples and they are perfect! But there will be a LOT of PROBLEMS! 1-Im an android user and we dont have courses like music or math, the app will be not much fun so please fix it 2-I sometimes dont know if Im closer to any achievement like perfect lessons, etc. But iPhone HAS it?! Why iPhone is getting so much attention?(not hating) 3-the lip syncing is working for them but not for androids?! Please fix it"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,So I've enjoy learning the language using Duolingo however I do find it gets repetitive also I would challenge Duolingo to record them doing the word challenges in the time allocated for that alone I'm going to knock off two stars as it's actually not possible to complete the word challenges in the time allocated without buying time extensions and I'm pretty fast at matching. This is a monetizing strategy to lure people to ascend to the upper tiers.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,good app to learn basic Spanish but impossible to progress once you get to a higher level without super duolingo. cannot learn from mistakes as you have to continously quit the lesson. should make it a better learning experience for people who don't want to pay like unlimited hearts. adds also super annoying as they force you to watch one after every lesson. do not recommend.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this! It's super easy to help you learn languages, and learning Spanish couldn't be simpler. But, on my phone, I'm 3 days behind on my streak than I am on my iPad. I'm on 24 days on my iPad, while on my phone it says I'm on 21. And the Duo widget NEVER loads for me. Plus, when I accidentally clicked free trial, it would let me cancel the free super duo trial until it finished. But overall, this app is super simple to help learn languages and I heavily recommend it everybody."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is great, fun, and overall awesome! Honestly the best language app I've ever used. The animations, characters, their different voices and personalities, leagues and challenges make learning fun and competitive. I heard that the Duo team is working on teaching math too! Very excited for that :)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app would be useful if it didn't cram 60 second long unskipable adds in-between each session. Then it has the balls to try and guiltrip you into doing lessons by sending extremely annoying notifications and reminders telling you how bad you are for not dedicating 23 hours a day to practice whatever langue you want to learn. This app is bait, they make the free experience extremely miserable in hopes to get you to pay for the upgraded version."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It might be better to customise the studies depending on why user is studying the language. 20% of the words I am forced to learn that I dont need. For example going to school vocabulary is not reqlly needed for me but I had to go through it. Moreover, when I first reached stage 2 I was taken back to course 4 on stage 1 as you made an update which was very annoying. Recently, for some reason I was automatically moved 2 lessons ahead without any explaination. Overall, I like it. Thank you!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A great app to learn the basic of languages. For example, I'm currently learning Japanese and it is going rather smoothly. I'm using the free version, and it still works out alright. I just dislike how we can't access things that could help benefit our learning, since you need to pay for it. Nonetheless, amazing app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Took a cruise and was worried about losing my streak with no data. Kept practicing offline hoping it would count and it did. Very good user experience! Also, i love how it gamifies learning. Everything feels very polished and clean, and doing lessons is actually enjoyable to me. The pace is slow enough at minimum to not burn out on it, and if you want to go faster you can. Quickly picked up the premium edition after the trial. Usually don't pay for anything for mobile apps, but I'm on 70 days."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's really great app. The layout is easy to navigate and user friendly. One thing I don't like. The notification are constant reminders to practice are like thorns. I have a busy day like everyone else. If I snooze the reminder notification make it longer than 30 mins before you remind me again. Maybe make them 3 or more hours between each one.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Was several units in when Duolingo changed the course content without warning and arbitrary out me on a different unit with a load of words and phrases not previously covered. I had to set up a new account and start again to cover everything. This was for Scots Gaelic. Duolingo constantly wants you to pay for premium but why would I when they make such drastic changes without warning.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"very good application. does not cover vosotros as it is more angled towards South America. Not enough grammar lessons embedded, which can make it difficult to know why your answer was incorrect. Takes too long to progress. You have to use it together with something that is faster and gives you more grammar rules. I use the Complete Spanish podcast from Mihalis Eleftheriou using his Language Transfer method for speed, and Coffe Break Espa√±ol to add vosotros."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used to really enjoy this app, but since the update practicing feels like a chore. The new design is super inflexible. Instead of clear, organized groups of lessons laid out in a space-conserving way, the app stacks all of the lessons vertically and they extend for miles. If you want to practice an earlier lesson, you have to scroll for a very long time, and when you log back in, you're at the bottom of the stack again. At the very least, please create a more efficient navigational system."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall a great app. However, over the last month (February 2024), there has been many instances where the app does not sync, and your lessons don't get counted. It has been very annoying, and if you aren't lucky and have a streak freeze ready, then your constantly wasting your jems just trying to keep your streak afloat. Before this became an issue I would have given 5 stars."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is great for beginners. And it's methodology of teaching makes it easier to understand. I love its repetitive method of teaching. Also, I love the fact that one could interface with other users just as the social media Furthermore, seeing the progress of others, as well the rewards given on the completion of quests gets you motivated. Only that there are too many ads, and the heart limit should be extended a bit instead of limiting it to just five. It makes it frustrating to continue."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I would've given this app 5 stars if it wasn't for 2 things, there are some language courses that are prioritised over other, for example the difference between dutch and german is noticible to the point that the dutch courses contain some mistakes, secondly is the fact that some learners achieve 3000+ xp in one day ! This makes staying in the league hard when you have at most 2 hours to spare for learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I do enjoy the app, the competitions, characters, and various conversation options to learn Spanish. However, the does app have bugs that don't get corrected. Half the time when there's a wrong answer, the correct answer flashes too quick to read, then moves onto the next thing. Also, there could be better and more creative options to review past lessons and vocabulary."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"On the whole Duolingo is an excellent service. However, two bugbears that I have with it are: the system's response to the speaking exercises are a bit hit and miss; and the lack of British English is a real pain. US English uses different spelling and grammar, and so I'm having to cope with deliberately making 'mistakes' to appease the system. Overall though, it's a well thought out app that is fun to use."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I use Duo solely for exposure. It serves it purpose, and it's entertaining. However, it has a few bugs. It glitches often. Also, some of the tranlations aren't accurate, specially if you are learning from Spanish. It limits langauge creativity and keeps you in a very specific box in terms of how phrases are structured; like there's only one right answer. It's a good complement to learning, but not great if it's the main source."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I wish I could go back in time with this app. Previous versions had a tab to click that would show a forum discussion about the sentence, which was super helpful to see why a specific word was used in a specific context. Now that's gone. My husband has the iPhone app and it gives you the option of paying (more, on top of our subscription!) to have an AI explain things. I have to imagine that it's the same AI that accepts blatant errors in my sentences, so, not really worth it to me."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo has chronic mistakes in the English translation as for example saying ""use to"" instead of USED TO in Spanish lessons learning past tense. Also, the use of coger instead of tomar, constantly using isn't, won't, didn't instead of is not, will not, did not etc. Also there is no way to review old topics because the app keeps erasing and changing what unit I'm on and no clue what's coming up. The ""tips"" never explain new things very well. I use this app to supplement my learning Spanish."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The gamification is fun. However, a lot of stuff is buggy, and they don't even acknowledge feedback. My wife and I are on a paid plan, and I don't have all the features she does. There's very little explanation on lessons; you're mostly learning by mistakes. Lessons often give less XP than they claim at the beginning. I sometimes don't get credit for completing challenges. Overall, it is a good resource that I'll keep using, but be prepared for a LOT of frustrations."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I think they should have left the answer planation part that was done by humans for the free tier. I feel human explanations are sometimes easier to understand. when not subscribed they should just add AI explanations. I noticed when I did the free trial and tried to do more exercises they started repeating the exercises as if to say since it's free we won't give you full paid access just my thoughts. They took features away that made sense in order to get you to pay understandably it's business
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm still not sure if I prefer the learning path system over the old method. The old method was divided by subject and allowed you to pick and choose specific lessons. Now you are forced down a (demotivatingly) long linear path. And although you can restart old lessons, their subjects are not easily identified (you have to click each one to know what material they cover). Still, it offers a whole lot for a free app and as such I recommend it in its current form."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app to learn another language. It has an appealing UX and good course structures. However, dropping one star only because there's too many notifications and prompts even with the purchased version. It takes a lot of clicks to go the next lesson when you finished one. Another issue is that the goal can't be specified. If you want to focus on listening/speaking, you have to go through all the frustration of spelling."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love Duolingo! It's such a great way to learn a bit everyday in bitesize pieces. However, I'm having trouble turning private mode of as it still thinks I'm under the age of 13. I also think that it would be nice if their was a feature to explain grammar and how it usually works as while it's easy to spot simple patterns, there are some areas which are more confusing."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great structure and incentives to do a little every day, without also feeling like life will end if you miss a couple. It's not perfect, though! Some of the sentences make very little sense, which throws off the rhythm. (ie ""Yes, you are the apple pie."" ???) My biggest complaint is with the tournament thingy. It is not based on language or progress, so ""competition"" can feel unfair. Also, the timed lessons are wildly inconsistent. 17 sentences one time, 8 multiple choice clicks another."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really like it - paid user using to learn Norwegian. However there are a couple of annoying features: 1) I get the same words every time I get to a ""personalised training"" session, so it becomes incredibly boring - maybe an AI bug? 2) I really like the training feature where you just speak, but I have no choice in which area to train. It is forced to the most recent three. I want to be able either to force just the most recent one or pick one from the past."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this one. Have been learning Spanish for the past year through the app and the podcasts on Spotify, and see a huge progress. Of course it's not as quick and useful as being surrounded by native speakers, but it still gives good basics and vocabulary to get more and more advanced. Haven't seen a better free app yet. *Note* that the app is not the best for all languages. In my opinion, it works best for romance languages and more common ones."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app was fine for a while, but every few months they update their courses to match a new standard. This would be fine, but it causes issues with your progress. Things I've never even seen before are considered review because they're now in earlier lessons, and some words I've already learned are considered new. This makes it very difficult to make progress because I now have to go back into ""completed"" lessons to find out what I missed so that I can understand current lessons."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There's a lot of free lessons to be had, before the whole ecosystem of full screen ads and nagging you to pay for hearts gets too annoying. There is way too much repetition of the same words, over and over. I know it's part of learning, but it's too much. Also a bug/feature that keeps reseting progress backwards, so you have to go though the whole repetition of the same few words over again and again. I was on unit 12. Went back to 10, then 9, and now it's on 7?! Not good!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I think the exercises are well structured for learning, and the prompts and rewards are effective. But the things it's choosing to teach me are weird. I said I want to learn the language for upcoming travel, and more than 3 months in still don't know practical things like how to ask directions, but do know the names of several zoo animals. Not helpful."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm learning Spanish, it is going great so far. I really enjoy the lessons and showing progress on the leaderboard . One thing that makes me remove two stars is accidentally pressing check on an answer . Please make sure that if a person presses it too fast add an ""Are you sure you want to continue"" button . I was on my last heart when this happend and now I lost all my progress . Overall it's great ! Thank you üåü"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The quality of translations has gone way down since getting rid of most human translators and turning it over to AI. I can't tell you the number of times it's said a correct answer was wrong, and I send flags each time. For example, ""ni√±a"" & ""chica"" both mean girl, so it isn't *wrong* to use one over the other. I've also had times their translation was flat out wrong. That's not to mention the number of times the mic doesn't pic up speech, or the times it crashes/freezes up."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a nice way for the practical learning of a language. However it is ""practical"" which means that as you advance there is no explanation of grammar or syntax rules, it has an ""it is what it is"" approach, which can be very confusing for some and has severe limitations in the learning of a language... Also one subjective point: there is a lot of ""great work"", ""well done"", ""amazing"" etc interruptions during the lessons, which can be really annoying, as they break the lesson flow..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Since Duolingo went public the product has reduced in quality while spiking in cost. I used to pay for super but now it's prohibitively expensive while the actual learning tools stripped down in order to push the monetization of the product. They removed great things like the forums that encouraged discussion and learning but never offered something in return. It's no longer for learning but another platform for ads and money making for investors. It's too bad it used to be a great product.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I think the number and range of lessons is very good, along with the encouragement through extra credits and league tables etc. I am perhaps old fashioned in that I would like to see more on the declension of verbs in their various tenses as these things arise. I would also, although it's more difficult, like to have more exercises translating English into Italian (in my case), rather than vice versa."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It NEEDS grammar explanations. Plural, singular, past, present, future tense, etc, etc... I can't keep making the same mistakes over and over because I have no idea WHY certain words change and which one is correct. You can't learn a language like that. It's too big of a flaw for this app to ignore... Also the streak thing is really annoying. I wish you could turn that off, I just want to learn at my own tempo without this stressful OCD-trigger every day."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Excellent app overall. Four things: - great for vocabulary and pronunciation but not for grammar, as there are no explanation why I get it wrong (languages have rules, if they're not explained, you learn by repetition, with no understanding of the language structure) - the quality of the recordings is sub-standard which can make listening a challenge, even with headphones. - Some of the teachings are incorrect - some adverts lag and force me to close the app and reopen it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Not a bad service, good motivation for language-learning, IN GENERAL really good. When I do a timed lesson, if the lesson times out before I finish, the app freezes on a grayed out screen. I have to close the app and restart it. This is really frustrating. Sometimes, when I'm really motivated to continue, I open the wrong app accidentally. Please fix this."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great learning tool, highly recommended. I took a french course for 7 months and while there is no substitute for in person learning, this is the next best thing. Their approach through repetition helps things stick. You're listening, speaking, reading and writing. Their leagues inncourage competition & motivation. All-in-all, i'm very pleased with this service and my progression."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is great to practice languages. Don't get me wrong, but when I'm in the lesson, let's say for an example.. I accidently closed the app, or I have to put the phone away. I do that, and when I come back, it restarts the lesson I was on when I was making such great progress üò¢üò≠ also don't get me started on the notifications I had too turn them off it was horrible it felt like I was getting them every hour !!! But besides those complaints and other small bugs, it's a good app!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Resuming: the best app to learn languages. Just two things: first, let's keep avoiding ads and talking about ""becoming pro"". And second, instead of making too many lessons on the same content, it would be best if having, let's say, around five or six lessons for each content, and teach new words a bit faster, and, to be systematic, add whole ""review"" units across courses. Of course, with less lessons, let's say, around three, four, or maybe, even five. But not so many. Speak to type not working."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Fun and easy interface, but unfortunately, it focuses mostly on parroting phrases rather than teaching and explaining the mechanics of the language. No explanations if you're confused about how or why certain words are used. No explanations of grammer and tenses and such. As such, you'll learn to say things, but you won't very easily learn how to build and independently use the language. It's fun, but if you're really serious about learning a language well and quickly, there are better options."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good but some futures are limiting, like the hearts as it just makes it harder to learn if you punish mistakes. Also the demotion zone upsets people if they lose something they worked hard for. Imagine losing something like that that you even worked on holidays for, when you are ill, when you've had no sleep, it's just too much sometimes. It is an amazing app though if you want to learn new languages with lots of different techniques to help. I like all the characters too."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's an amazing app and I'm really glad that despite the limitations and ads, you can use it for free. In my opinion the subscription doesn't include enough benefits for me to be tempting. One thing I really don't like (hence the 4 stars) is that sometimes the exercises are crazy repetitive. I've been doing Italian for quite a long while and I'm still getting asked what Arrivederci or Ciao mean (bye and hello). And sometimes it happens multiple exercises or units in a row... but keep it up ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app can be extremely frustrating! Especially when you're typing and the app glitches the ""check"" button right under your thumb and you're marked wrong! Also, when you're typing out your answer and you're marked wrong because the app doesn't know all the possibilities for phrasing. This happens a lot and it's frustrating to no end! For being free, I guess it works, but there'd have to be a lot of fixes for me to ever consider upgrading. A lot!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"the app has improved a lot since I started using it. The practice is good. Alas, I noticed a few mistakes in some word's pronunciation (radio - radiota), some sentences/words marked incorrectly as mistakes (screenshot available), faults in recording the XPs... so, overall, slightly disappointed when that happened, as there is a weekly competition and mistakes count. I use the free version for Finnish. thank you."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"(Spanish Course) does a great job of teaching a language by breaking it down into smaller sections to work on. a few downsides. 1) after a few chapters the app tends to crash often and doesn't load the animations. 2) it tends to freeze in the middle of a lesson but an easy fix for it is long press the icon, app info, force stop. 3) the lessons teach you new words and conjugation for them, but then later goes in depth about patterns to look for. overall a good app, I plan to keep using it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have been using duolingo for over several years. The app is one of the best for learning languages. But it is missing a very crucial feature. The ability to reset an entire unit or one of the circles inside a unit. If you are far into the curriculum you often forget which units/circles you need repeat because you haven't learned or undertsood them or just for revision. I'm sure many other people would find this feature helpful. Kudos to you for this free and fun language learning app. üëè
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Have been using this app for years (paid version since 1 year). I started with Spanish and now Italian. I don't think this app replaces actual language courses, but it is fun, and you do actually learn to at least read the language. Listening also improved, but having an actual conversation is still very difficult for me. The app almost always works perfectly. I bought a subscription because I was frustrated by the ads and the heart system of the unpaid version."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The paid version is obviously so much better. It's hard to progress in the free version with all the ads. I think the only thing that would make the paid version better would be if they added some mini games with little quests or something. Or conversation where you have to speak stuff back to practice formulating responses and not just saying random sentences. It's a great app and very helpful.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I think a lot of the features in the older versions were better. The ease of clicking on key info before a lesson to practice, and being able to search through sections to review specific topics was much better. I could select a topic like ""travel"" and do a refresher instead of scrolling for 10mins on a ""pathway"" & still not review what I wanted. Literally been 2 months and I still can't use por or para since those pre-lesson notes/reviews are gone. I just guess. Looking for a better app now."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Learning Japanese, 7 days in, and though it's simplistic, it explains it well enough for me to understand and pick up on sentence structures and placement. Learning to write is separate from the sentence structure lessons. Ad between each one, but they are decently varied and don't run for more than 30 seconds. I am thoroughly enjoying the app, but I don't recommend using just this. Find other apps to use for exposure and additional learning. This is good for beginner learning, though."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Edit: I love the app and I pay for it. The reminders are not as passive aggressive anymore. Two big downsides: 1. Kanji, please teach them from the start! The seperate tab is way too slow and is not consistent with stroke order. 2. The sections and units keep shifting and changing in Japanese. It doesn't feel like I am making progress, because I get thrown back and forth between units with updates. The paths inside each unit are way too long, I get the hang of it in two lessons."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is making changes all the time which are - in my opinion - not improvements. I have been using the app for over a year, but after all these changes I am considering trying another language app. Some of these changes are: - removing the view for learners to see how far they are to the next achievement - removing predictive text from the Gboard keyboard (really?!) Duolingo was a lot of fun and I enjoyed doing a few lessons every day. Now not so much, it has become a chore..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's not perfect, but it's a fantastic free resource. The ads it gives you aren't scummy or weird, it paces your sessions pretty well with the heart system, so you dont do too much in one session and overwork yourself, while still encouraging you to practice a little each day. The only thing duolingo is lacking in, is grammar. The app doesnt do much to teach you grammar or how sentences are structured, so you have to go google it and figure it out yourself as it starts to question you on it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is ""free,"" but it really is not. You can only do about 25% of it with a ton of ads. You lose stars with any mistakes, which makes you have to listen to even more ads. Many times, I would complete a lesson but not get any points added to my total. With the paid version, there's no losing of hearts, and there are many more activities available."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I was completing gold star lessons, but after an update, the gold lessons randomly turned back into regular completed lessons, no gold star. About half the lessons in every unit in multiple sections reverted back. It's very frustrating as I was doing the gold stars all along from the beginning. I tried to contact support multiple times about it, but they never even responded. Otherwise, Duolingo is ok. I've tried other apps but always gravitate back here. The price is right, too."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"All the lessons were changed, and the lessons which were previously completed now have lots of new information in them. So after months of making steady progress, I can't effectively complete new lessons because the app thinks I know lots of words that were never taught. Update: Now they have the suggestion strip on the Android keyboard. With dexterity problems, this makes it very difficult and frustrating to type. Wish I could give 0 stars now!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very good learning app. It has helped a lot. There are a few bugs where my answers were coded as wrong but the correction displayed the same answer I gave as correct. Also when there are more than one word for an item, I got it wrong when I used the first one learned even though they're the same meaning. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoy using this app!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app has been through alot! expanding a team costs money. The free version is good for fun and learning something new, but if you run out of lives, oh well, and there are ads. So I have premium version. Many more features. No ads, no lives, it's worth it! It's fairly accurate if you're learning 1. From English 2. Learning a common language (Spanish, German, etc) it's still in development, I only see this service getting better!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've had so many instances where I have answered/translated correctly, but the app says its incorrect. Once you make it to a more advanced level in your language, it's as if Duolingo throws English grammar out the window and will only accept one version of a translation, even if it is an incredibly cumbersome translation. I'm coming very close to walking away from Duolingo once and for all."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Good experience with the free version. Jan. 30/24 I now have the family plan, and have had constant problems with bugs and things not working properly. I have reported things through the app and by email many times, but never get any response and the problems are on going. Have had the paid version since August and am thinking about going back to the free version to see if there is any improvement."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I use Duolingo for many years. I think it used to be better. It was harder and used to teach many more words. Now it introduces like 10 words per month and repeats everything ten thousand times. I think that is not how you learn a language. It also takes away ""points"" for making mistakes. You learn by making mistakes. I would prefer to be introduced to many more words and just not remember some than know 10 words per month perfectly. There could be different difficulty levels so you could chose"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"BEWARE: Predatory pricing scheme. They offer a Duolingo super subscription free trial, and you think, hey, why not? But you have to enter your credit card info ahead of time. And by the time at the end of the trial period, without warning they will transition you to the super Duolingo with no warning. And boom, a huge charge for the yearly subscription WITH no option to refund it. Extremely sleezy business practice. Shameful."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app has been helpful in smoothing out my chosen language. However, the hearts system is horrible. It's discouraging at best. Especially if you're doing a longer session on the app in the higher tiers of the courses. Also, reviewing your mistakes is behind a paywall. Of all things to put behind a paywall in an education app, this should never be one. Loses a star for this alone."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy learning a new language. Duolingo is easy to use. An improvement would be to only collect badges and not compete in the league. That's not motivating for me, grades aren't real but progress is measureable. Choosing your level of interest and proficiency goals would also be helpful. Is this available in the paying app? The app occasionally doesn't give me my progress when I get 100%, that's annoying.ü§ì I don't want to compete with others learning a language. Progress only, please."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is fun and effective. However, the leagues will stop your progress dead in it's tracks. I was doing great until I got caught up with winning the silly leagues, which forced me to resort to grinding tricks and completely killed my forward progress (and joy). My advice is to go to the website and turn off leagues by setting your profile as private. They should make it an option within the app. Once I did that, I started having and actually learning again."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely fine as a free app and for learning the basics, but it's getting very frustrating, particularly since the redesign. This got rid of the grammar, so it's more like just learning sentences by rote rather than learning than the language. The personalised practice is a very poor replacement for being able to revise specific lessons. It seems to fixate on 10-15 ""weakest"" words and doesn't refresh and going back through the path is almost impossible. A shame, as it's otherwise very good."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've used this app for many years, through many of their restructuring overhauls and the introduction of paid premium and the changes with the hearts system. There's been a decline in the overall systems quality for a while, in my opinion, but I stuck around. However, recently, there habeen more blatant issues within the lessons themselves and as of recently, I've learned that they have been transferring over to AI tools and have recently laid many human staff. Things will only decline even more"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The comments section really helped a lot, it's a shame you removed it Also audio keeps missing from my lessons. It appears at times, and I hear the sounds of notification (right and wrong answers, lesson end), but I'd like to hear some pronunciation as well. All in all - fun app, encouraging you to continue your language studies, but be sure to use it alongside other materials"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is fun, and im enjoying it. I think the app is lacking in one major way. The lack of rules. If not for my partner teaching me the rules of feminine and masculine and word structure being different and why It would have been more challenging. It helps in developing an understanding instead of just memorizing. Please start incorporating teaching rules and this game would be 5 stars and worth every cent."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is great if you are completely unfamiliar with a language. Prior to travel, it's worth the splurge for premium. That said, premium is too expensive for daily training and it's difficult to make progress from the free version--I lost all points/gems, rankings, etc. when I downgraded. Would be great to have speaking sessions as an option when unable to type, so I can practice speaking and listening."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"They continue restricting content, removing helpful features, and injecting ad content to the point I sometimes have to go through two ads and a social media plug before I can get to another lesson. The lessons have been broken down into a far slower pace to stretch the time someone has to use the app and see more ads. The super user cost is prohibitively expensive for trying to learn something to connect with others. I am continuing to use this but am ready to jump ship very soon."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"After 5 years using this ""memorize everything"" app, I realize I'm not happy with it. It needs a search function and grammar discussions. Sorely disappointed and going looking for something more complete. Also, the contests don't encourage learning. You have to do the same practice hub lessons over and over to get the most points. There are no grammar tips in the help for each unit. Much needed"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app used to have really funny stories to translate, and you could choose more challenging stories if you liked. They've removed most of the stories now and I'm back to learning whatever level they decide I'm on through normal lessons. This can be a little boring when it's too basic. It is good for building up vocabulary but maybe not for interacting with native speakers (as I've found the hard way!)."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Decent introduction to the languages and nice vocabulary builder for new and returning language learners. Some good variety in lessons and examples, but minimal in explanations and can be a little too repetitive. Japanese course is missing speaking practice and more practical lessons like conversations. The hiragana, katakana and kanji is unnecessarily repetitive and takes too long to move on. Lastly the paid version does not have much advantage over the free version."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Having taken advanced Spanish language courses for five years and traveled in Spain, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru, and Chili, as well as living in high Spanish speaking areas, this app used to be a great skills boost. I think I had the paid version for a year, and free for ages more. However, the change in structure has reduced the usefulness as I'm stuck practicing basics since reinstalling. This might be tolerable, but laying off staff in favor of AI replacements is the last, cheap straw."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really love this app and look forward to using it everyday. The little characters make the learning fun and as someone with ADD that's important. It does have problems though. I have to go out and come back in usually 3 times a session for it to update my score and my mistakes don't show up for some time in ""Mistakes"" so I can't do them! It also doesn't understand when to use ""whom"". V annoying! I wish you could have dual color hair on your avatar too."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Between the constant resetting of courses, frequent unnecessary UI changes, learning features being discontinued or locked behind a premium subscription, the lack of control over which words you want to review, and the replacement of real translators with AI, I do not recommend this app. Duolingo started off as a great resource, but it keeps shooting itself in the foot and only continues to make learning harder, not easier. Its basically Google Translate. Try other apps, Duolingo is not worth it"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"There is a glitch in the app. Several times you can't select any thing to give your answer, and no option but to back out of it, losing all progress you have done in that lesson. Other times it allows you to do one or two words, then not the rest, so your option is back out and lose all progress or select to move forward knowing it will be wrong just to move ahead in the lesson. This has been going on for weeks. Please fix."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"You will learn another language eventually. The repetition is great for committing new concepts to memory. It could use more adjectives and synonyms to help you to establish a style of communicating, however. You're on your own there. You also won't learn much if you don't make sure to refrain from looking at the optional answers altogether until you've thought of the entire sentence on your own. It's necessarily too easy for the most part, unless you follow your own rules of navigation."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"My only real gripe is how terribly it works with Bluetooth headphones. It fades in and out between sounds / utterances as though the connection goes to sleep in between? It could also use a little bit more of theoretical backing / overview at times, like how verbs are conjugated, but otherwise nearly perfect. It is addictingly fun, well designed and operates smooth as butter."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've used Duolingo for years and really enjoyed it. However, it is now much different and less useful when I started, because of the limited errors per day, much more frequent and annoying ads, and most shockingly, replacement of human translation with LLM-powered models which are known to make frequent errors. I can understand some monetization, but it is not worth it for an app I can't trust anymore, and I will now uninstall."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What was once a great app, just keeps getting worse. The format change in 2023 forces you to scroll up to see what category you are in. Even worse has been the loss of years of progress due to this constant change in lesson structure. In 2022, this app had a great mix of new content to make language learning fun combined with the more tedious but necessary repetitiveness. Then in 2023, it became too repetitive and boring. And now I may not see new content till I regain former progress."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo was great when I first started close to two years ago with language learning. However, they have steadily declined as they've become more focused on making money. Courses have been discontinued, and the learning tree was replaced with a much worse structure. Recently, they fired a bunch of translators in favor of AI. I used to love the app and currently have a super subscription (just canceled), but I am now looking for other ways to learn and recommend others do the same."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Very good experience overall. I like how they start with things you would need to use in an everyday setting. The one thing I don't like is the streaks. It would be nice if you could set a schedule for your practices so you can choose which day's work best that way your streak doesn't break and also there are many features that are limited if you don't subscribe which is a bummer but other than that great app.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm not a big fan, I paid for a year so i am doing a lesson every day but find it will take forever to learn on this app. The app really doesn't ""teach""much. There is a tiny ""guide"" at each section you have to locate & review yourself but other than that its the same sentences & content with no explanation or theory, over & over. It will keep bugging you about rankings & has annoying race against the clock type activities. Mondly is infinitely better."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo has a lot of errors and mistakes in their lessons, especially in their audio. They make a lot a weird and unnatural grammar choices, and many of the lessons feel machine translated. The app has the option of reporting mistakes, but many have still been showing up for over 1 and a half years. If you already speak a language, this is an okay app for practicing and learning a few new grammar points, but it's definitely a poor choice for learning a language from scratch."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app for learning language! it is very thorough and it goes over sentences over and over to make sure you remeber and understand them. the only issue is that when the ""five in a row!"" and similar screens pop up, on semi-old phones the animation is really laggy and will take around 2 seconds to get back to the lesson, sometimes making you unable to even see the ""five in a row"" animation and instead show a white screen for 2 seconds. overall though, great app! üòá"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Its great so far, but then you get stuck with a burst of new terms, with really no way to practice them. When you have a paid service, there is a training area, but it does not allow you to choose the lession type you want to practice. such as all/current/last 3. A lot of the time I get stuck on the same exercise for the entire day. Also for some reason there is no addition of note cards to or a way to choose to make your own test. That said, great second or third tool to use to learn."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My wife (who has MS) and I have been users and Super Duolingo subscribers for years. Apparently they've just rolled out an Android update that disables autosuggest/correct and voice to text on your keyboard while using the app, presumably believing that this helps you learn better. It doesn't, this is a bug, not a feature, and not only that, it's an accessibility issue for people with disabilities like my wife. It's now unusable to us, and we can't even get a refund for the next year we paid for"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Its great for getting started and motivated learning a new language, and if said language has a different alphabet, then Duolingo is great at teaching you said alphabet. My problem with it is that progress is extremely slow. Even after you're done with the course that takes you >2 years to complete, you aren't fluent in your language. I wouldn't even say you're halfway. The best way to use Duolingo is for getting into a new language, or as a refresher. It's mostly just a fun app game"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is an easy way to learn a new language. I think that this application could be improved by having personalised lessons to strengthen your weak parts in the language. Also, I think this app should have a 'What have you learnt?' challenge, where, at the end of each level, you answer the questions based on the level you have just finished. The language I am learning doesn't include speaking exercises or stories, which is a bit disappointing."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I actually like the concept and I even got a subscription. But after using the app for a while I may not renew at all. While I like the game-like structure for motivation, it is at times way too annoying, pushing for FOMO instead of real learning. Lessons rely too much on translation and penalise user by errors not in the target language. I'd rather prefer that a question or answer is presented in the target language, and the user needs to enter the counterparts in the target language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'll say this is a great app. You really learn a lot if you think about the patterns you are noticing and don't just memorize.It's a very engaging app. The big issue for me was a glitch with the voice recognition. There are voice lessons where you need to speak into your phone. Duolingo just won't recognize anything. Even if you're screaming into the phone. These glitches aren't frequent, and lucky doesn't impact your lesson progress. But it is infuriating."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The free version is very good for the price, the price being ads. The ads are well int√©grated and don't glitch and are mostly harmless. Unfortunately, I lose progress regularly because of my internet, so the gaming/progress features only sour the experience. If you are good at pattern recognition you can pass questions without actually understanding what you just read. I hear they are replacing translators with AI so I've lost a bit of confidence in the quality."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The quests system is very bugged. Sometimes I will complete a daily quest, but I won't get the reward nor a point towards completion for the goals for the month. Sometimes it will randomly update later in the day, but usually not. This has been an issue for months. For some reason I also need to meet 50 quests a month, whereas my friends only need 30. Not sure if its because my XP is higher, but I feel like it should be the same for everyone. I do have Duolingo super, but I won't renew as of now"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This has been a helpful tool for learning foreign language for me, and the experience has been mostly positive. Voice recognition leaves a lot to be desired. Sometimes it doesn't work on some words, other times it needs something pronounced incorrectly to work. The leagues system doesn't reward progress in languages as much as it should. To stay afloat against other users, there seems to be more benefit with spamming review lessons."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app really helps you learn a language, or if you already know a little of the language, you can practice more on what you already know. Btw, as a person with a busy life, the exp challenges that you do to rank up are really like if you have Super Duolingo, you're set to get the top three. I was racing somebody with super, and they got 200 exp in 10 minutes. I only got 30. It's pay to win."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Doulingo is rapidly helping me learn French, and is fun and easy, especially since you can make things repeat if you need. I highly recommend duolingo. (Edit:) Not so fond of the new update, I have not even seen the characters that make the app seem so alive. Also, they just extend the courses and make them more dragged out. If they changed this back to the way it was before, I'd appreciate that."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,They've suddenly become more interested in making money and making poor decisions. They greatly increased the event difficulty several magnitudes beyond what it was so it's no longer useful. I keep getting content in practice mode that I haven't even gone over yet. I often accidentally hit the can't listen now. I would like the ability to at least have to confirm or cancel that out. Maybe even move it somewhere else.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great for learning vocabulary but awful for grammar. I'm using it to learn Italian and I'm guessing the order of each word and what version of ""the"" to use 90% of the time. Very frustrating when there's more than one reasonable option. A lot of the audio is incorrect as well so the ""type what you hear"" exercises are redundant. I've learnt more Italian grammar from my friend than this app, and we've had around 5 conversations about it, compared to my 195 days using Duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love Duolingo, but the app is glitchy and causes unnecessary frustration. For example, if you finish a lesson at midnight it clears all your daily goals with no chests to open, or on the ramp up XP challenge it will randomly make me start at the beginning, even though I made it with time left. I wish it had more options to keep me involved, love the matching game, but it isn't always available in Japanese or other languages. Also miss stories. Wish all languages had these options."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I am on level 2, and there was an update. When I looked back onto level 1 all if the exercises were totally different! Even the subject matter. So I have to start from the beginning, but because it thinks I have already done it, I can only do reviews, so can't see hints. I do think the app is better since the update, apart from all the work I had already done is now replaced with totally new content. It would be fine if U could start again but it not register that you've done it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Errors in lessons are no longer being corrected in a timely manner. I've reported a couple that I'm 100% certain are wrong, but they continue to show up. I'm not sure if it's months later, but definitely weeks later. It's still useful at this point, but if something looks questionable, don't assume it's right. Update: I've discovered that listening to the intonation in Duolingo is interfering with learning to speak correctly."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's actually not a super effective type, however, the app teaches you enough to speak and write at least the basics. I particularly like learning on Duolingo. And some of the defects that affect me the most when I use it: there are no stories in most languages; Duolingo Super is very expensive; and rankings hinder teaching. And also, the best things about the app: the characters have animations during the lessons (I think it's really cool :]); messages of encouragement! Conclusion: Pretty cool!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Personally I find that it does help me to advance a language. however I believe that it is not the best for teaching grammar rules and tutoring should instead be used to memorise those. apart from just teaching a language I think it is also a good, fun and productive way to waste some spare time therefore even if you are not serious about learning a language this app will still be good for you. the ding sound effects do get annoying eventually."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm studying Russian & have also used Duolingo for Spanish. Most activities are fine, but the voice activities can be frustrating. Sometimes they work fine and other times no matter how much you say exactly what the sample says, it still doesn't count it as correct, even words ive done before w/ no issues. This is frustrating because after so many tries you lose a heart. I think the program is set to do this purposely so you run out of hearts and have to buy the app. Busuu is much better."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Been using this app for more than 30 days, i was really enjoy it, this app helps me to improve my chinese. However since they changed the sequence of hanzi, it has become harder to learn and practice lessons. The words are no longer linked, makes it difficult to focus on learning new words and sentences at one time. Hopefully the team listen and aware about this impact and restore the structure to prev version :)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The absence of being able to turn o the characters from talking is infuriating. Plus its mapped to the media volume, so you can't listen to music while using the app. It once went of during a funeral by accident. Being in that position only for a big bear to start wailing of something in spanish is enough to ruin a timeless experience. Please change this. I remember how duo was better at explaining grammar before. And you could use it offline. Its become greedy over the years. An ok app though."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Been using longer 6 months. The quality has been dropping steadily. Many of the sentences have become very odd. I am a native English speaker, and either the sentences that are created are bizarre, or the translation is just weird (but 'technically correct'). Example of a translation to English: ""The kilo of meat is very expensive"". No one who speaks English would consider that a normal sentence. I am disappointed that my family just got on a plan, and I expect we will not renew it when it's up."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have been using Duolingo for Spanish since 2022. It was great and very easy to learn until the ads started showing up one day. Without the super subscription, it's just too hard to keep practicing for a long time. I was forced to take a subscription and it was really helpful. But over the last few months, I have been facing a lot of bugs and glitches that are making me furious The lessons don't register in the friend's quest and XP boost sometimes vanishes. I hope the team fixes it!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new layout is catastrophic. I know your goal is to implement spaced repetition, but that would have been possible in the old layout without imposing the new one. It's not user-friendly at all. What else, I just lost 20 ""chapters"" worth of lessons, because the new layout imposes that we SKIP lessons and mark them as finished whenever we do a chapter further ahead. Counterproductive. And I didn't even mean to jump ahead! Bring back the old layout."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! It's consistent, it always give reminders to tell me to keep learning. It has amazing techniques to teach new words. But that's also the problem with the app, it only teaches you new words and gives you only a few tips in the guide book. It doesn't teach you when and where you can use the new word, and it would be so difficult if your language has a lot of rules. You have to Google the rules of your chosen language yourself. But besides all that, it's the best app to learn with."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It is an educational way to waste time but not for serious language learning. The biggest annoyances for me are the mistakes. It has the option to report them, but it is a waste of time as they never get fixed. It really is shocking how many grammatical errors I have found in the English translations of phrases. It tells me I am wrong and gives me a version of the sentence that is grammatically incorrect. Next time it pops up it's more of a quiz on what Duo thinks the answer is."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"EDIT: Duolingo repeatedly tells me I'm wrong even when a native speaker sitting right next to me tells me I'm right. Do not bother with this app! The new interface is horrible. I was thrown back so much, when the new interface was introduced, that I'm considering quitting all together. Why would you make the experience worse? Just give me the old interface back!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Useful for getting exposure to a new language, good for getting your feet wet. The timed matching exercise are okay, but the words don't load fast enough. Can't possibly complete it in time if I'm waiting for the animation to finish and the words to slowly appear costing me seconds. It forces you to use a power-up to get three stars, which feels like cheating. Just my opinion."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Makes learning a new language addictive in the best possible way. Premium subscription is very reasonably priced for what you get, but I personally am happy to put up with the short ads. Trick is to use your streaks to motivate you. The larger your streak is, the less you will want to loose it and the more you will practice. Build it up to begin with, and you will never let it slip. Excellent tool, 10/10"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"fun and engaging, like a game. Nice team challenges. Too bad I keep getting 2x potions to use right away, despite I am already using them at the moment, which makes the game too long. Freeze days could be a valid alternative or 2x that I can use later. The French learning from an italian speaker also misses of table of content, there is nowhere I can check verbs conjugations, just new vocabulary. Do not expect to actually learn a language with this app. It's more about learning some more words."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's definitely usefull and i love it so much, but it does seem to be more difficult if you have a learning disability and need a bit more time for the timed things, among other small issues. I have been progressing rather slowly in mine due to my learning disability but with a bit of tweaking / adding of a feature for those people with those learning issues, it would be even better."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It is nice to learn, but it has its cons. It keeps spamming me with super doulingo ads, and it says that I can get it for free, and one second later it asks me to buy it for what, 12 dollars? Also, it is laggy, and it has streak-saving problems. I did a lesson, and it tells me that I didn't, even though I did, leading to my streak being lost. I wish that you could add more widget themes and types. I sometimes enter the lesson, and when I use a more formal version of the word, WRONG! üëé"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"used to be excellent, but has steadily been getting worse and worse (enshittification is real, y'all). january last year I could see the forum discussion on each excercise, and it was full of excellent things like links to resources or corrections when duo was teaching awkward or outright wrong phraseing. they got rid of the forums, which were the best features, and now they are getting rid of actual translators trained in the languages that used to make the lessons, and trading them in for AI."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Greed has won over quality. The revamped interface that replaced the old platform around a year ago, leaving us with limited features has made it more difficult to learn new languages. Translation is not always available. The discussion forums are no longer accessible through the mobile apps. The audio podcast modules that used to be included with the mobile app, gone. Instead, you are bombarded with long dodgy ads. Very sad."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great language learning app. I feel like there are too many ads and not many lives. Also, I thought you were supposed to get duolingo premium for reaching a streak milestone. That doesn't work for me. Whenever I try the 30 day challenge, it never let's me get past day 7 then it resets. It gets pretty annoying. Also, why are their features on one type of mobile device that aren't on others? For example, there is supposed to be a music thing that my friend has but I can't find it anywhere."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really have enjoyed the app so far, the lessons are entertaining and the culture around Duo and the ""silly sentences"" is hilarious. What I wish I could do is toggle off the option to partake in the weekly leaderboards. I don't have time to sit there and spam lessons, nor is it conducive for actually retaining anything. I'd really like the ability to opt out of the weekly challenge against other learners so I can just focus on meeting my own personal goals"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've tried some other language learning apps but Duolingo is definitely the best one so far, it's fun, interactive and easy to use. I mean, really easy, my 8 year old sister knows how to use it- it's AWESOME It would've been 5 stars but I've come across a little issue. Other language learning apps I've used have this thing where you must say the word out loud, into your microphone, and helps with pronunciation. Duo doesn't have that but I'd change my rating to 5 stars if it could be put in!!!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The lesson methods are fantastic, the graphics and interface, clean and intuitive, however, after a while, it feels like you are giving yourself the lessons without any linear directions, and may get overwhelmed. The pay version is VERY expensive, wanted to see if it was better, and really just support the developers. I decided against it for the price, don't get me wrong, I want to give them money, but the value for the price is way out to lunch."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This review is for the paid service. The big warning I would give is that customer service for this app is non-existent - I've emailed questions about my subscription multiple times and no response, which is pretty poor considering how much it costs! Also, in the Italian course the content of the units seems to have suddenly changed and become far easier (going from complex tenses to colours, for example. I wouldn't have paid for a course that was so basic, so I feel like I've been cheated!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Rubbish if you actually want to learn a language. I've used duolingo for ~600 days (learning Italian) but the game-ification of the app means that actual learning takes a backseat to streaks and xp. The old style layout was much better. The latest updates have removed any explanation of language concepts, instead giving just some ""examples"" of the grammar used with no context. You're much better off listening to podcasts in your target language or trying another app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Replaced human translators with AI. Which is the primary reason why I'm rating so low. Also generally poor quality language learning. I've found myself being able to learn the grammar of some languages fairly easily. But aside from that lessons are overly repetitive, boring and rarely offer any real challenge since most lessons are multiple choice. Also an over-reliance on translating to your native language instead of focusing on synthesis. Use Mango instead, it's not as frustrating."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The graphics make language learning fun! However, since I have been doing 4 languages, in the words section, the app confuses German words with Spanish ones. Also, the audio is really glitchy, most times not able to be heard at all on the section matching the sounds with the print. The only option is to say I can't do listening right now....because I can't hear anything!!! This is a new segment, and I hope it gets improved soon."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"An app that seems great, when you're starting out and don't know any better. The farther you go, the worse you realize it is; lack of clear explanations, lack of context, sometimes using archaic or overly formal phrases that native speakers would never use. They used to have a comment section for each lesson, which would let you turn to the community for deeper answers, but now that's gone too. The app is essentially useless in its current state. I am moving on, and will not be looking back."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app, but I can't see an option of a mini dictionary for words that have been learned in different sections. My problem is I get through a section but quickly forget them. Other than that, it's very useful. There was a flashcards section for some languages, and it's included in the photos of the app above - but I've not encountered it when learning the Ukrainian language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Updated: Great learning app, but... Pros: Progressive, bite-sized lessons, frequent updates (content as well as format), lots of languages to choose from. Great for beginners. Cons: multiple curriculum rewrites have led to mixing of old and new information: long term intermediate learners like me are stuck / unable to make progress. It's like being half way through 2nd year university and being told to restart the year becaue they changed the curriculum. Also way more bugs since ~2022/23"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Very bad content in a great app! I feel like I've been practicing 20 words for 2 months. Every once in a while there is a new word or two but then they're gone in the next lesson and we're back to practicing ""car"" and ""bread"" for the 500th time! It's really a shame because I actually like the app and the gamification keeps me motivated to come back but then the unnecessary repetition and slow pace makes me feel like I'm just wasting my time."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"As far as an app without text/work books go, this is an excellent way to learn phrases and vocabulary fairly quickly. For those who need grammar and sentence structure, this app is not for you. I used to teach English so I am very familiar with verb tenses. This app makes little distinction between simple present and present imperfect structures so a person who is not familiar is not going to understand what the difference is. Excellent otherwise."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"A few updates ago, they made everything work, then they updated it a few more times and trashed it. There are now too many problems to list (including on a new phone). In addition to app issues, the problems include a decline in actual course quality. I used to recommend Duo to everyone, but now I am embarrassed that I did and steer people away from it. At this point, I emphasise DO NOT pay for it. If you want to use it for some basics or to brush up, it's ok, but don't trust it fully."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Such a great app. The metholody seems too repetitive at the beginning, but then you suddenly find yourself knowing the grammer and hundreds of words and understand why it was this way. Also, the game like structure motivates to come back regularly. If you don't have time to go to a physical course, no I'm correcting myself, even if you have time to go to a physical course, go for Duolingo instead."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Lots of repetition, great way to learn a language. Everything explained really well. Several years later, the endless repetition is very boring, the English idioms are American ones, there are virtually no new words, no more instruction on grammar or tenses. A couple of weeks ago, despite practising every day, it said I'd skipped a day and used a streak freeze. In the last 24 hours, it started telling me I'm offline (I'm not), and returned me to day one! That's the last straw - I quit."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Update 31st jan 2024: Duolingo today made life difficult for those using Gboard who have trouble typing, or for others who need to use voice input - they have disabled the ability to use predictive text and the audio input microphone (which is on the same row). For those with reduced dexterity, losing swiping and predictive text is a major reduction in functionality. Original review: terrific language learning app. very addictive. a much better use of your time than playing a useless game."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Path system is an abomination. Used to be so much better. Arabic alphabet function is useless, makes you repeat the same letters for 100 times. Skipping is made overly complicated. Stories are way too rare. It's the best of the worst. But getting progressively worse. Developers should stop substituting their own ideas and ambitions with big data."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Text often too small to read kanji. App is prone to getting stuck/not saving. Often won't accept right answers for things with multiple translations. Sentences are repetitive to the point that you know the answer without actually reading or understanding. The ""correct"" English translation for Japanese phrases is often not how an English speaker says it. The placement test uses phrases with subjective translation (their translations are quirky at BEST) and can't be repeated. Pro: it's free."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've only been doing it for a few days, but I have already found it incredibly enjoyable. I do think that (as a suggestion) that there could be better ways of remembering the hirigana. For example, in school, I was taught 'ka' as car off a cliff because it made it easier to remember. Just an idea. Overall, good app. Edit: It's really annoying! I did my lesson yesterday and the day before that and yet it used up a streak freeze, saying I hadn't done my lesson! Really frustrating! Please fix it!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have enjoyed this app in the past for practicing languages, tho I never picked one up successfully. Made some progress :) They fired their human translators though, and are switching to an AI model with humans editing. I have no interest in the types of misinformation and quality compromises that AI language models introduce to students who are learning still. This app has lost any value to me it used to have. Too bad, DuoLingo was big enough that they didn't have to compromise everything."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Love this app but since a few updates ago it has become impossible to switch the order of words by dragging them, which is a massive headache because if you missed one thing you have to remove all the words and reinsert them. Please fix this. The above was posted in 2020 and never addressed. Now I've also been unable to do speaking exercises on the android app for several months if not over a year! Microphone settings are fine! Just fix the app!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"- Can't earn streak freezes anymore with daily challenges. - Course has changed multiple times over the past year. - No grammatical explanations or lessons. Also not in higher levels. - Support is absolutely useless (non existant) when you have an issue. I'm done paying for Plus, and since the ads and limitations in the free version are probably even more demotivating, I might as well put an end to my 2 year streak."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is great, especially the fact there's a free version. But it's SERIOUSLY lacking in features. How there isn't a flash card section to easily practice vocabulary is mind blowing to me. Apparently this was discussed as a feature and never executed, quite dissapointing really."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I don't like the change to the learning path. It doesn't feel well structured. XP is harder to earn. Lesson states XP for a specific lesson, but after completing it I was awarded less XP. In some cases XP was not awarded at all. I have lost interest in the app and now feel unmotivated to do multiple lessons. The changes seem geared towards forcing you to complete the learning path in order to earn any XP, and penalises you by awarding a tiny amount of XP for practicing earlier lessons."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'll give it a five star. to be honest it's absolutely amazing. I couldn't have asked for more. I like how it always reminds you (widget home screen and Gmail) to take a lesson even after months of not practicing. Duolingo always wants to make sure you're learning. Jsyk they're offering a 60% off to subscribe to a premium plan. however if you don't want to, the basic plan is really cool and I'd recommend it anyday! It's UI is lovely, friendly and easy to navigate."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app overall, but it would be nice to be able reference past lessons without having to complete them again. Plus the speaking parts can be a little glitchy - I sneezed during one and passed, and in another, I had my whole family say the word ""l'oeuf"" and none of us got it correct. I can't find a ""report problems"" feature, either."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"User for 10 years. Used to be good, but no longer. Keep making frustrating changes. They just disabled Gboard keyboard support. Plus, way too many language mistakes to count. A few years ago they completely stopped correcting errors. They just teach you wrong and aren't accountable for poor quality. You're penalized for mistakes on new material. This app is more about bilking you than helping you learn."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They're implementing AI and recent news of them FIRING linguists and everyone but IT has made it obvious it's about to drop in quality. I had been nearing a 600 day streak but since the language I'm learning is an essential, I'm dropping the course and going to more official sources to learn. Considering how I've been on the course for almost 2 years and I've barely managed to be able to pick apart phrases in the language, maybe you should too."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I recently found that the iPhone app allows dragging words. On Android, I have to tap a lot of words to remove them one by one and then add them back if I made a mistake in the beginning. Also, the timer pauses in between questions during the ramp up challenge, but it resets to 0 when the app is put to the background. Make sure you restore the remaining time, when the activity restores. Update: sometimes I use a chest and it disappears, with its effect applied with a significant delay or never"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm currently getting hiphop music playing over the top of all exercises. I keep getting ads with the ""close"" and ""buy"" buttons in an Asian character set (i think maybe Chinese, but possibly Japanese). In learning German, French, Italian, and Spanish. 90% of my mistakes have no real indication of what I got wrong. E.g. I'm trying to use the feminine form of the sentence, and it suggests that the answer is masculine even thought the input question has no gender markers"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I think it's a great app, really fun and not to mention you can learn different languages at the same time. OK this is an edit.. nearly a year later! OK I think it is actually good. They have changed it alot but honestly for the better. Also pro tip get duolingo widget on your home screen, believe me it really helps you practice. Who knows maybe in a year I will write another review."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a solid learning tool. You're not going to become fluent in whichever language you're trying to learn. Learning Japanese on this app wasn't as good as I thought it would be. The kana learning needs work. It's great as a recognition tool, but it doesn't give you many options to write. The AI pronounciations, the lack of explanation of conjugations, and no virtual speaking practice as is done on the Spanish lessons, severely hinder anyone that is trying to learn any of the CJK languages."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it's quite a motivating app to learn languages. somehow I have been using it for 3 weeks everyday and look forward to it. The only downside is the subscription fee. It is quite high. There is a free version with ads. however, the free version is filled with ads of games which may or may not be scams. In the free version one can only make 5 mistakes a day. So be certain of your answers!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Multiple times I don't get credit for the lessons I complete which makes the friend quests irritating. And when I get paired up with someone at a lower level than me, it puts the quest amount to a ridiculous level. We need to take 30 lessons in four days! Also, The rapid review sections are literally impossible without guessing before reading the questions or buying more time."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Why can I still not access the new music lessons that we were told about last year? I like your app and have used it for years to learn a language, but I was excited to try the music lessons. I've waited patiently, but they never show on my app. I've tried updating and googling solutions. Nothing has worked. I'm very disappointed that it's not accessible. I'd rate your app higher if I could access the music and math that I was told about months ago. This would be a '5' if not for this."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I really like this app. But it's annoying that comments have been disabled and you're not allowed to make more than five mistakes in the free version wich I know is supposed to be motivating but sometimes it's really frustrating. Making mistakes is a major part of learning and shouldn't stop one from doing so. Also you can only get the correct awnser with one sentence structure when there's multiple to use in real life. So I almost always have to guess what the app wants me to say.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's really AMAZING!! I've been using this app for a couple of months, and it really helps you to understand and learn languages in a fast, effective, and fun way!! I do suggest this to everyone, especially to students, if u wanna learn a new language, but another thing that I'm quite disappointed with is that it has a bit too many ads. Many of my friends also suggested that it would would've be better if it had tamil, too."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is an excellent and fun way to practice and learn a language. It's sometimes repetitive, but that's a necessary part of the learning process, or you easily forget. At a free level, making silly or accidental mistakes can be really frustrating, ending your day's progress (no more credits), but you can still practice without advancing. I find the format mostly clear, useful and amusing. I'm improving my French, even after living in France for seven years. It's giving me a lot."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"App is usually simple to use, I am using it for Japanese. The biggest issue is the AI voices it uses, for a language like Japanese that has many similar sounds, it often makes me miss because the voice was not clear. It's also rather poor at teaching nuances it just gives you the questions and you tend to need to trial and error through. I am learning slowly, and the bite size lessons are great, but its sub to get more functions and less risk when getting things wrong is very pricey."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm on a 1300+ day streak with Duolingo and what it's offered has been well put together in terms of lesson content. But the app itself is often so glitchy that it's unusable. Crashes frequently sometimes crashing my whole phone with it. Sometimes the keyboard won't come up, sometimes it won't go away. Has got worse recently to the point I'm on the verge of giving up. Such a shame."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Easy to get a lesson or two in each day so you continually make progress. But when you make a mistake, the app isn't helpful in explaining why the mistake is a mistake. The app does too many multiple choice exercises and not enough writing and listening ones. It's a lot harder to recall words and write them on your own than it is to pick from multiple choice. I don't have multiple choice when I'm trying to talk to someone! Also why need listening exercises to learn how words are pronounced"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Over the last several months, Duolingo's lesson structure has fallen off big time. I'm using this everyday over the last two years and more, and I still see the same sentences that I saw over a year ago, although I have done 100s of lessons since. No new learning material, it just says 'personalized practice' as the topic of every lesson, and it's basically just redundant words and sentences. What happened? Product team needs to wake up. ML models are good, but have some supervison please"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the way of learning and encouragement on Duolingo, it's so easy! Just when you do it for some weeks, it's starting to get a bit boring, cause they use the same style of lessons, the same characters and it seems to be repeating over and over again. Guess that's when people start to drop out. Please, feel free to add some new styles and approaches, especially for the Super Duolingo version that you pay for. PLEASE!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I've paid for this app for two years. I've become more confident in speaking Spanish but it's a far from perfect means of learning. It seems to concentrate more on league tables and streaks and its use of the language is very inconsistent. Some of the voices are incomprehensible. It's now stopped working. All attempts to contact Duolingo have failed. They don't respond to any means of communication at all. I have only just renewed my subscription and feel I've been cheated.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The computer voices don't pronounce certain sounds with enough differentiation. For example, ""ri,"" ""mi,"" and ""ni"" sound so similar, it can be too easy to lose points on listening tests. Also, I read the news that they recently laid off a large number of people in favor of AI, which is unacceptable - translations are notoriously inaccurate when not handled by a real human. I was going to purchase Super this year, but I'm not giving them a cent now."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm trying to get in contact via your email but keep getting blank auto responses? Great app! Would be better if it gave option of learning European Spanish with vosotros. I also get annoyed with silly spelling mistakes due to clumsy fingers on little phones such as an s where the a should be. However, all in all its fun, the repetition works and that helps me learn. It only when getting the opportunity to talk to someone Spanish I really appreciate how much."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've been using duo lingo for a few years now and I like it. I'm learning several languages. What I really appreciate is the ability to learn different writing systems. However, I wish they included the same function in languages that also use the ""English"" alphabet with wildly different sounds. For example: ""bhuifl"" in Gaelic sounds like ""whil."" You don't get to practice that anywhere, you just have to figure that out as you go. It's infuriating and makes learning it so much more difficult."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I qm sad that they got rid of the comment section, as it was VERY helpfull with some things. And also i would love to be able to practice each unit as a whole. You can only practice the exercises each, which is a bit annoying. Would love to practice every unit as a whole. And it also would be awesome to have those timed challeges to not be timed. Like matching words but have time for it. Helps a lot for practice and learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Although this app is great for learning some basic words and phrases, it doesn't teach you any grammar at all, sometimes I feel like a kid jamming a square block into a round hole trying to figure out what the correct answer is. Also duolingo has just fired 10% of their translators and replaced them with AI which is vile. Also the free trial for the subscription has no reminder to cancel and charges you for a whole year with no chance for a refund once it's been paid, which sucked massively."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Still okay for the most basics however it's become inconsistent, placement tests when you return are obscured away and you have to go to the website to drop the course and get a new placement, even with that it still drops you back at the basics which isn't bad to brush up on but expected more new content. Kanji being accepted in text entry has become hit or miss and the app keeps changing in less and less convenient ways. They let go a significant portion of staff for AI that's not trusted yet."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I got the app again after seeing screenshots of the Duolingo Owl judging you on your homepage when you haven't done your daily streak. I'm really enjoying learning Spanish again and I think the lessons are very helpful! Especially that they are all spoken. I repeat the phrases and it helps with my memorization. The stories are my favorite! Some are really funny. I'm also really enjoying Super Duolingo without ads, but I have a free trial, so we'll see how long my streak goes when it expires."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I was learning chinese over 2 years ago and recently picked it back up with the app, the older version when I was learning had basic speaking exercises to help get you to use the correct tones which I really liked! I come back recently and find that feature is gone unless you pay for it, I was going to pay for it when I realised it was going to charge me more then I pay for netflix or any of my streaming services! I tried the free trial and I can't even access the speaking parts still!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is not only cute but insanely complex. Yes, you can learn over 10 languages but there's also a psychological memorization algorithm to how this works. It starts by putting basic information into your brain and giving it a good bit of work to slowly seep into your memory, then it gives you more little by little until you can remember the language clearly. That's only the simplified version of what really happens but it's so well thought out and really ingenious. Can't see notifications."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is great for building vocabulary, not for truly understanding grammatic structures though. It lack grammatic tables, explanations, focuses way too much on competition. The platform's cute, but it's not the most important aspect of a language learning app. Overall, it's a disappointment, since I have to guess the grammar, instead of learning it based on a thoroughly explained set of rules. There are also 10-point grammatic errors in the English translations."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Please stop forcing Super Duo trials on me. I don't like/want it. Wish they'd add story time + speaking to Hebrew. Good for getting a grasp on a new language, though. Update: Newest version took away all discussion boards, which were a great way to get advice & be able to hear almost every sentence. We now lose hearts practicing old lessons if we click into specific ones, which disincentivizes practicing old lessons. The path update forces you to new materials too fast, so you don't learn well."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's fun to play the Duolingo games and it helped me learn vocabulary and some basic sentence structures. However, after one year, I still find it challenging to integrate everything I've learned and bring what I've learned into everyday conversation, so I think there's room for improvement"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,it's amazing I love it soo much. it's such a great app I 100% recommend. the ads are what you want them to be they are like every 5 to 10to even 20 mins and it really did help me learn a little of JapaneseüáØüáµ. although I don't believe any app of any kind can teach like to speak any language fluently without someone talking to you that is experienced. I think this is an amazing app. and if you're looking to download it.. YOU 100% SHOULD! ! ‚ú®(I hope this helped)
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm 152 into learning Japanese. Overall, it's not bad, there are times when it's frustratingly slow, and teaching me words that I'm obviously never going to use in any scenario, but I am learning from it. My biggest gripe is with how it teaches kanji, it does it completely different from anything else, and fails to explain a lot of things that would make it easier to understand and remember, but unfortunately, I also haven't come across anything else that teaches kanji much better."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is fun,educative and so easy to use.It is clear and precise.I love it!!! However,I have realized that during the practices,when you have to translate mandarin to English or vise versa,some words are not there so it makes it hard for you to complete the exercise. I think that could be one of the things to be fixed and/updated."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like the app, but the constant changes are annoying. This past one, they got rid of all my medals I earned. Like the streak medal, and a bunch of other stuff and now its replaced by achievements that def werent there. All my work, down the drain. Not to mention, you shouldnt be FORCED to make am avatar and then not be able to change it later. Thats so stupid. The only thing I have from before was my 401 day streak I had. E: I just went back to my stuff, they got rid of my legendary trophies."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This new update is horrible... It looks like I'm tossed right in the middle of who knows where, because when I look at previous lessons I believe I did, I'm totally lost. I get wanting to stay updated & fresh but... this is confusing! It's as if you're taking a language class in college & mid way through the semester, the professor completely changes the syllabus."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a decent app, but I wish you would reduce the ai pronunciation content on the Japanese course. It's outright wrong a lot of the times, the grammar explanations are also very lacking. I wish the text was read by a human instead of the robot voice, it makes horrible mistakes and some letters like Chi vs Shi vs Ki are virtually indistinguishable to my ear when the A. I. is reading it. Please use more humans for a higher quality experience."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It does force you to push yourself and learn more (with new format). I am using it twice a day to get the two daily XP boost. They have glitches when offering an extra heart or an extra chest that after watching the ad, it doesn't actually give you the heart or the gems! Someone needs to get on top of fixing the glitches before continuing to roll out new features."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There are better apps to learn languages. This one often has bugs so you can't complete responses and repeats phrases that I already know very well and I waste hours on content already learned. They don't have a good SRS method for bringing words back that were new in previous modules so you'll never truly have them down without creating your own flash card system. I really like the app Lingq so if you want to start with this one for free to gain basics, quickly move to a different app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"A good app, but I have concerns about the direction of the program. Duolingo has removed its best features. I can no longer ask other people about a weird phrase and know why I was wrong. I can no longer go out to Duo's language events. I can no longer expect updates for small languages or expect any new courses. My best most immersive language learning experiences via this app (and accompanying website) are now impossible. Now Duolingo is the same as every other app. For beginners only."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love this app for my German studies! I bought super Duolingo and it's been very helpful and fun! Although, me and my roommate are both studying German and we agree it would be very helpful if Match Madness included der/das/die in the matches. We both struggle with memorizing the articles and it would be a cool feature to add in. Thanks for an awesome app!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a very magnificent app for building health habits of daily learning, with focus on languages! The choices of languages to learn is good for now, even though they still have to include so many other local languages and popular dialects of languages! One of the few improvements I want to find there is the interaction with community, which will help in language immersion for learners, and this way they can grow in their learning! This way the material will diverse and more interesting!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"seems to be a great way to learn a language but the app is pretty buggy, at least on Android. Mine refuses to give me speaking exercises even though I've made sure it has all necessary permissions for microphone access. They also clearly have issues selecting which words to give you to practice. I seem to be reviewing the same words over and over again while a whole bunch of ones I don't remember well never come up."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,When starting out Duolingo (Italian> it keeps you at the SAME questions for way too long. To try and skip ahead with quiz almost works but they throw in one word you don't know & it keeps you there . I have answered the same questions 100 times successfully & then they continue with the same questions even as level up. makes me nott want to log on. However when I did French at a higher level it moved faster. and gave NEW knowledge and challenged me Instead of wasting my time .
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm a long time user but I haven't like the heart system. You can only make 5 mistakes? That's insane and really discouraging for people who want to learn. And paying for it isn't in my list of financial priorities. Edit - new update switched up all the lessons for me, disappointed again. At this point I'm just logging in to continue my 2+ year streak."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Cool app if you want to repeat sentences instead of learning the actual rules of a language. I feel like the curriculum should include the rules of the language as it goes on, but the only help it offers is a small button in the corner with maybe 3 examples. May or may not even be what you're looking for. Repeating the same 5 sentences every day is causing problems in my progress with this app, and I only open it to do a practice lesson for my streak."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Regardless of the quality of the language teaching, which is so so, this is not a finished app. Quality of performance is worse than any app I've ever used. Can't use it for more than like 10 minutes before it slows my entire phone down to a crawl (no other apps have this problem). To even be able to get a modest amount of learning in in a day requires 1-2 complete restarts of the app. I know this is a common problem with others, but they refuse to do anything about it. Cannot recommend, fix plz"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app for learning. I am currently learning Italian because some lines in one of the books I read are Italian. It's great and I love the speaking exercises. My only complaint is that the widget is a bit glitchy. Like, on the app it will say I have a 138 day streak but when I look at the widget it will say 136 or something. Not that much of a difference, but it's still there. Other then that, I love the app!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"After using this app with Hebrew for almost a year, I dropped a star. They are very, very good with some things but not so good in others. For the Hebrew, they have ""practice your words"" launched, but it doesn't work at all on the Android app and is only semi-functional on the web (no audio). They are not good at responding to user feedback, either. After I have completed a year, I will probably drop my paid subscription and move to a different platform."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They removed profile photos, with no options to change them to anything but a Mii. Also, the Spanish audio is horribly synthetic and hard to understand at times, yet the Polish is almost flawless. I don't understand. Also constantly begs you to sign up for the subscription after every lesson, as if ads aren't enough already. Used to use an old version of the app, until they forced the changes to update."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Not a great fan of the app so far. It is more focused on a game and collecting than learning. Mistakes punished with not being able to go again due to no hearts. The app also does not progress for me after each level and gets stuck on loading screen so I have to reset the app between every single level. Poor it has became a pay to play course whilst losing a lot of its old self. Very repetitive and slow progression on words that would not be very frequent in conversation without much emphasis on
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I get that it costs money to keep the app running but they excessively keep advertising the super version, which is annoying because in order to do most of the activities that give you more XP you need to pay for the super version. It's like rubbing it in your face that you could be rid of the annoying limitations on mistakes and needing gems for everything. I'm definitely not gonna pay for the super version if you keep reminding me of it after every lesson."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Pretty good with regards to the basics but you pretty much hit a brick wall due to the lack of or no speaking exercises. I've been learning greek for 7 months now and I do pretty well through the exercises. I went to cyprus and gave them a phrase I'd learnt. The waitress didn't understand me and said my pronunciation was off. Speaking is a huge part of learning a language and the most fulfilling part as it feels the hours spent learning are paying off! Sort it out duolingo
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Getting worse by each update. Now the discussions have been removed from the app also. That was the most useful part as Duolingo does not provide much explanation on its own and native speakers could explain the actual usage of the language. Please bring it back. Also, there is no detailed explanation given on the grammar for each unit, everything is just thrown at you randomly. Cute game, but not a thorough learning app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I really like learning languages but it's sometimes unfair to me lately. It's because I am literally Deaf and I often see that they try to get me to practice any audio lessons. I wish that there's a switch ""no"" on all audio lessons/tasks for deaf learners to pick for future lessons. It's really annoying to see them trying to get me to practice it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo free version is not a good experience. However, getting the paid version (discounted) was a pretty good deal. I use this in combination with Mango Languages through my local library, which has been the best experience I've found after trying other apps over the years. Duo has a few things that bug me, but overall I think it does pretty well with content, accuracy, and accessibility approaching a new language. It's a pretty good value for something I use every day."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Not impressed. There's a lot of repetition, which is good, but it will randomly throw in new words and expect you to know them. It will also speak the words w/o seeing how they are spelled and have you try to match them to the English translation through multiple choice. At that point it becomes a guessing game and frustrating. There's also no explaination on how sentences, words or sounds are formed in the language you're learning. Not sure how anyone can learn a new language from this."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"very good app to learn a new language. im learning quick and efficiently. you get daily reminders to do lessons. the lessons go from typing in the language, speaking, hearing and matching etc. you can also have a friends list to compare with your friends or contact you know. very good feedback. keep up the great work Duolingo, and all the best with the languages. Ich lieben Duolingo!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is making me learn Russian so much easier! it's been hard for me to learn Russian by my parents, But now using duolingo, It's so much easier. But there's just one thing, there's no Latvian option to learn. but over all, 5/5. I recommend you use this app although it doesn't have much languages to learn, Still use it! It makes learning languages much much easier to learn new languages. I recommend adding more languages to this app so people can learn more! Thank you for reading! (if you did.)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good idea and realisation, if you want to pick up a new language, you can try this app first, it will give you a taste of the language and give you basic vocabulary which will be useful if you decide to take a proper course later. Since recently there is a problem with the app where the app freezes once the timer runs out during rapid review. Once this is fixed I will give the app 5 stars."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's mostly good but there are some bugs. I'm in Indonesia and it gives the night owl chest at 6am and it gives the early bird chest at 6pm lol. And now it doesn't give the chest at all, it pops up with the message but then the chest is locked and doesn't give the XP boost. So it's not fair for the leaderboard that I can't get the XP boost. Also there should be more variety for the sentences because you end up memorising the sentences rather than the vocab. Randomise it more."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Doesn't teach you things, then dings you when you answer incorrectly. Doesn't give you all the grammatical rules -just examples. No explanations of why - just expects you to absorb from repetition. The heart system hinders learning, you want to keep going, but have 0 hearts. Tips usually not relevant to the errors you make. Near impossible to find help with any specific grammatical troubles you may be having. ""Report a Problem"" drop-down menu doesn't have all the needed reasons."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is really great, but currently, I'm having some difficulty to progress as the app may bug When I finish a level, the progress is not immediately displayed and sometimes we have to pass the level again and again to see the progress. Please solve this issue. Thank you ‚ô•Ô∏è"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There are so many problems, first the AI speaking sucks, I can't understand it at all, you remove great features that should've stayed and helped like the tip feature and people talking to each other. AI replacing everything doesn't make sense for something that is meaningful to humans and how they can share their culture with people be replaced by AI? This sickens me, if I didn't have to use duo for school I would stop using it immediately because I'm sure there's way better apps out here."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"4.5 stars good language app, understandably ad driven, learning is relatively easy and I can see that it teaches more than simple a few words or phrases but rather builds a strong language base around sentence structure and otherwise. learning is game-i-fied which appeals to my competitive nature. generally compelling lessons and lessons designed around mistakes seem like a great way to improve on repeated errors."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love duo! I use it mostly for Spanish learning and practice, but have occasionally tried other languages. I've learned so much with duo, but had to doc a star because new alphabets are hard to learn from duo. I think they need an alphabet chart that you can reference in and out of lessons, especially in the beginning. Otherwise, I love how it slowly builds grammar rules, allows for essentially unlimited practice, and is very encouraging. Amazing especially for a completely free app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like it. I find it hard to learn things a lot of the time, but the way they teach is easy and understandable for me. I do hate that Im not able to make more than 4 mistakes without getting super though. And the personalized practice stuff bieng limited to super is also frustrating, but I understand they need to make money somehow. if you want to learn a language, I think this is a good start."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Edited: I have been using this for over 700 days (French) and there a few things I would love to change. I wish it was more consistent. Sometimes it allows for typos but not consistently. And it's very repetitive. I know that's how you learn but 10+ of the same lesson gets old. I also really wish you could choose the subjects. I don't want to discuss social issues or news related things. I use this app to use my brain to learn but also to get a break from normal life.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app makes learning a new language fun. The only thing I don't like is that there is a heart system which you have 5 hearts and everytime you get a question wrong you lose a heart. If you lose all your hearts you can do a lesson to gain one back or use 250 diamonds to gain all back. If you don't want to have 5 hearts you could get Super Duolingo which gives you infinite hearts, but I think the subscription is pretty expensive for learning a language. The rest of the app is great though."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good but very repetitive, there could have been a lot more vocabulary learned. There isn't much variation between lesson styles. Also the way hearts refresh takes a long time and unless you are a paying member, the gem cost is very high and not many ways of gaining them in order to complete the extra levels. Over all seems good, would like the option for European Portuguese."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"i like it. It's a bit of a pain sometimes to repeat the same lesson 5 times in a row. I would much rather have something that sees you struggling, and repeat the lesson, or sees you getting perfect lessons, and letting you go. Instead of fixed N¬∞ of similar lessons. That said super is a must! they had an excellent deal for new commers I do not regret 1 single bit this"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app has a less knowledge about the words .. If we go in deep the app has a very limited word collection.. And the second thing is that there are so many ads literally after each course we get a course automatically. The third is remove the heart system as it is disturbs the flow of the game which irritates me..
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The newest update seems to have fixed my previous problem with slowness, but now the animations won't move (I've checked the animations setting, but it's on), and it's constantly behaving like I'm in battery saver, but I'm at 100%. I see no battery saver setting in the profile. Please let me know if there is a setting to get me out battery saver mode."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's fine, but the match madness daily is very clearly trying to be to win instead of learning. It's a tight timer, but they offer you more time if you pay, they also offer you fewer options, making it easier if you pay. I'd be happy to ignore it, but they're pushing it as a daily task. It's just grubby to transparently push the money option. I already pay for the year, and they're trying to nickle out more."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It was great, i wouldve gave a 5 star review but they updated the course on a language, which added characters that are completely out of my level, and it was extremely confusing and i dont want to restart my progress. I wish there was an option to choose if I wanted the new course or not."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"this is an amazing app that let's you learn many languages but it doesn't have all of them. For example, my mother language, tamil is not in it. It even has fictional languages but it does not have the Minecraft enchantment table language. Also, the prices for duolingo premium is too expensive, at least in my opinion. Everything else is amazing though."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this to learn Japanese for almost a year and I'm not sure it suits my learning style. The biggest problem is that it's just rote learning with explanation of why phrases are the way they are coupled with the rote memorisation method being used just not having the repetition required for the lessons to stick. You'll see a phrase maybe 3 or 4 times before the lessons progress to new, unrelated, phrases."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's pretty cool when you get that sudden realization that you are beginning to understand another language, but after more than 3 years of everday app use, I have become disgusted with the app. They say you can learn a language in just ten minutes a day (for twenty years maybe), that isn't what I hate about it. It has many errors in the language hints and doesn't explain why you may have gotten an answer to a lesson wrong. I also dislike the competitive environment. I would not subscribe to it!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Before any feedback, I highly recommend using this app as a training platform, it is very well done! A very good way to start getting the general idea of a new language. I think that the best language to learn on the platform is still English. The other languages tend to have less grammar material to access in the section workbook. Some exercises related to plurals become tricky and it's not clear why both of the phrases are not correct. Pronunciations are weird or inconsistent sometimes."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This program is incredibly repetitive with the same exercises over and over. I have translated the words China, Holland, Chinese, Dutch, salad, heart and tower at least 1,000 times, as if they are the only words in the language. Some of the sentences are also incredibly repetitive. If I have to translate, ""Were banana shoes ever in style"" one more time, my head will explode. I could be learning sentences that might some day be of use in conversation, not discussions of banana shoes."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is great for basic level skills. My son is doing the duolingo em portuguese, I found some errors in the translation ex: A borboleta e um animal, instead saying the butterfly is an insect, says is "" animal"" which is wrong! . So I always correct him. I find some the translations are wrong too and does not make sense! I think is a great concept just need to revise all the portuguese translation."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They removed offline lessons, you can only do one lesson offline before you have to reconnect to the Internet. I'm going to keep using the app but I can't give this app a good review until they add back such a basic feature. They could make it a paid feature for all I care, just add it back. It's really disappointing to pay $80 for a year of premium just to find out they removed the premium feature I most excited for. Let us download courses!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Annoying and distracting amount of American words in the English translations. Often you get something wrong and there's no feedback or help as to why. I find myself guessing answers and not actually learning. The daily challenges, motivations and leagues are really annoying. On the plus side, I am learning a little bit, I'm just not sure how much. Trying to listen to French videos and cartoons online and I can't keep up with them at all, so I think I'm learning to read French but not listen."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Duolingo for a few years to learn French and Japanese, so I can at least say for those curriculums that they're excellent!! I've learned so, so much- and all for free! On top of the language learning aspect, I love the graphics, animations, and sound effects, and I think the UI is very polished! Highly recommend this as a first step if you're considering learning a language. Duolingo devs have made something truly incredible! ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love DuoLingo! I knew some very basic Spanish but wanted to improve as we were headed to Mexico for a month. I've been able to have conversations with the locals! Amazing. I love that there are different characters with different accents, tone, speed, etc. Different ways to reinforce the learning and very motivating with the challenges. Highly recommend!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I pay for the extra only because I make a lot of mistakes. I don't like how quiet the app is; I have to turn my phone volume so high. Nothing is explained phonetically, so you end up making the same mistakes because of a lack of understanding sentence structure. I turned off the leagues. People def cheat the system. You won't be able to use this app to become fluent. It's good for vocabulary and memorizing words, not actually speaking. Very school based vocab not what you'd use in everyday."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app makes me weirdly anxious. Ad revenue is obviously understandable to fund free education, but for a serious learner it is too restrictive unless you get a paid subscription. As lessons get more complex, each phrase holds more potential for several mistakes that feel traumatically like life or d‚Ç¨ath. You have to quit your progress and break that momentum by having to stop and regain hearts. It is putting me off of wanting to invest the time and focus if it is just going to be go-stop."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The lessons are fairly easy, and you do learn quickly. I'm not really sure how accurate some of the words and phrases actually are because they don't match up with google or bing translate programs. Also, to be in constant competition with other learners is boring and distracting from why you want to learn a language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a great language app that gives subscribers an unfair advantage over nonsubscribers. You'll love it if you subscribe to ad-free Super Duolingo. But, as the app warns, you will likely not complete a course if you don't subscribe and pay the lump sum annual fee. The ads are many and distracting. Features and points are fewer, lessons take longer and it's just not as much fun using the free version. Still, it's a good learning tool‚Äîif you can stand the nonstop ads and nag screens."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Excellent app to learn a language, yes. Have been using it for over a year and am glad to have chosen it. I do have a small complain: When you update your lessons' order, please do NOT push us ahead in the course. Pushing us back is fine, but ahead? There are so many lessons that I have no knowledge about, and I wake up in the morning to see that I've skipped through all of them overnight."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am required in the daily quests to complete stories, but the app has skipped the last three stories without my being allowed to do them. In the past year, every single helpful feature has been removed. You never get an explanation for why something is wrong, only that it is. Most of the hints are misleading, so there's actually no teaching at all. Since the last update, I constantly get quests for speaking exercises even though I've had them turned off for months."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app, I have a 50 day streak so far and it's really helped, I'm learning German but for some reason the for 1 and a half units are talking about things like ""The elephant is smart and tall"" like when will I ever need to say that ever? Also when trying to do the XP ramp up challenge for the leaderboard, I got the the very last challenge, I have done it like 5 times correctly and it refuses to complete it even with 100% accuracy and completion within the time limit."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Good, but still needs improvement. I still occasionally get glitches, most common is a lesson won't load and I have to restart the app. Would also be nice if Stories were integrated in a tab on the app. Jan 4, 2024: The constant ""updates"" that take away useful features, change or eliminate progress, integrate extremely long ads shilling microtransaction based games, extreme price hikes, and now the addition of bad AI and layoffs of important staff have made this practically unusable."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Fun, but not deep. Some errors in the lessons. Also, not as customized as they want you to believe. For instance, from time to time, it will want you to practice your ""weakest"" words. This is bogus. It randomly generates words, most of which you have never gotten wrong even once. But it's a pretty good app to get started on a language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,As im using this app more and more I keep finding some features being annoying for example when I'm typing an answer on my keyboard on timed lessons sometimes the prompt for buying a timer boost pops up closing my keyboard and me miss-clicking to buy boosts even though I did not want to.. There also could be some explanations to why a word changes in a sentence now its just learning words. BUT over all its a great app to get started with most of the languages
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I wish I could give 4.5 stars. The app is fun and educational. We sprung for the subscription. My wife and I are on German. We started with Spanish for awhile and then she did Greek an I did Italian. We prefer German so far. Less nonsense and more useful words. For instance, she had lots of pink stuff. I also think there is too much exact repetition. For instance, using the same exact picture and sentence to enforce a word. You just can do that without thinking at some point"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I recently started the Japanese course, and reached a streak of over 70. There were small issues I was able to overlook, like inaccurate pronunciation guides due to different phonetics in English and Japanese. There were also more major ones that I put up with since it's a free, casual service. What finally put me off the app for good was the decision to lay off translators and rely almost entirely on AI translation. The ethics issues are bad enough, but this will also make the service worse."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am giving this app a 1 star because they recently make some horrible changes they NEED to fix. They made the achievements so that you can't track your progress which makes it VERY difficult to set goals for yourself! I KNOW they can fix this because it tracks it until you get your 1st achievement and then you can no longer see your progress. If they fix this, I would give them a MUCH better rating. For now it is SO frustrating!!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It is an easy and great way to learn another language. The notifications are useful if you are busy. Edit. If I wanted to learn Arabic the first words to learn would be how to greet people, not noises used within the language and how to write them. Also, how many times in Spanish and French do we need to be reminded that the words taxi, hotel, and pizza are the same or very similar as in English. I have to watch adverts, I pay for super duolingo and it sometimes switches to the non paid version."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Pretty nice approach towards language learning. But some obvious flaws: 1. Flash cards missing. 2. Grammar explaining missing. 3. When you rehearse old lessons (for gaining new hearts), you keep getting the easy words in the beginning over and over again. 4. Each lesson often ends with ""Now it will get hard"", but that does not happen. 5. You are expected to put sentences together before you know the individual words. It could be a really great app once these basic flaws are corrected."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"this was a great app, for some reason the last update is making the speech tasks very slow and it isn't properly counting XP. Also of note, there is no in-app help or trouble ticket system, and they are not responsive to emails. I used to love doing lessons every day, it has started to feel like a chore because of the bugs."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a good enough app to learn, but there are certainly some problems. It would tell me I wasn't pronouncing certain words right, even when I got a *native speaker* to say those exact words. And there are challenges - especially ""Matching Madness"" - that will be timed, yet rely heavily on vocabulary the app hasn't even given yet. Also the difference in their premium and standard services is like night and day."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Overall it is a good app to learn the basics (only at the beginner stage) the only part that's frustrating in on the what do you hear sections that give you 4 options to pick from you don't get an Idea of what the words mean, just a sound to select and a correct or incorrect result... hoping that as I progress its more of a day to day conversation lessons that will be more helpful"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It teaches you new words every day, but if you are new to learning Spanish or another language. I think they should give a wider range of words for each category and much more study time to memorize the words, there spelling, translatiing from English to Spanish and how to speak that language fluently! It all takes good time so the lessons will also!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"seems to no learn as fast as I was hoping to, especially in hearing. maybe it's just me. The ads sometimes take me to unsafe apps according to my Norton. Also, why don't you have ads in the language I'm studying. Af/er two years, I can have a basic conversation. But your Ads! One long minute of boring ad that is loud. Gime me a break!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ads that don't respond to pressing the mute button and are loud enough to wake the dead every single level, 3 second lag, missing audio in listening exercises, no indication of what local time the clock switches days(making people miss their daily streaks on, for example, switching from daylight saving to standard time). Sentences that make no sense(neither grammatically, nor semantically) in either of the languages. Barely usable without the paid subscription. Wish I could give 0 stars."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Learning Japanese is the worst on this app some of the characters don't match the sounds they try to romanize things that don't make sense then they put impossible challenges for you and if you want to make any progress it seems like they will like for you to upgrade. There is not a time where they don't ask you to upgrade a super lingo so annoying.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Although I'm super appreciate this app being free it feels like a waste of time at the moment. I finished section 1 and it felt a little slow but I made good progress. Now I'm section 2 where I should be learning more and advancing my language skills, but I'm getting the same section 1 words presented as new, out of 10 ""new"" words there will be 1 actually new one. I can pass sections without mistakes by translating the 1-2 new words I'm supposed to learn in this ""level"". Looking for alternatives"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a very amazing app helping people to learn a new language ,but I would appreciate if you just don't refresh the course and the progress daily because you have to start over and repeating everything again. it feels like you are not making any progress and sometime you loose the motivation to learn because you want to learn not to open the app everyday saying we refresh the course for you and I have to repeat everything I know already"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"now I've been using it for a while. I still think it is good, but extremely annoying . it's South American, not Spanish. It's designed to annoy you into paying for. the main encouragement is the competition, which is addictive but impossible to win without paying. they also give you rewards, but also remove them often. then we have adverts that regularly crash to delay and demotivate you unless you pay, but then who could expect more?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love learning Japanese on this app, but that was only until the update 2 days ago. When I logged on, I noticed I was pushed forward an ENTIRE SECTION and 20 something units! When I look back on all the lessons, I've realized that there are around 200 or so words it skipped me past that I had no chance to learn. This new update is infuriating, and I forsee a terrible outcome for this app. Once the best, now the worst. Please fix this."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Learning mainly Japanese. Used to be a good. Quite trash now. Every now and then there is a huge update where it changes the structure of the lessons. It introduces completely new words in previous lessons I've already completed. So, when I do a revision lesson sometimes it would just give me new words, grammar, verbs and tenses without any warning. Very disappointed that the ""updates"" do not account for this. Unfortunately my streak is too significant to stop now."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Too many ads on phone!! The whole experience on phone has changed, ads are more present, I get it (not that I approve, it's why I use as little apps on phone as I can) I also understand that I can pay for premium, so let's get that out of the way. Being forced to watch 1 or 2 ads per little mini exercise is torture, instead of learning new vocabs I find myself able to recite by heart the whole damn videos shoved down my throat."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"As of writing this review, I have a 1080 day streak running. I've used this app to help with Spanish classes, brush up on Polish, and more recently, learning Japanese. The app is great at reviewing grammar and its applications within sentences, but I found it to be tedious when it comes to vocabulary learning. The lessons are very repetitive, and you go a while before learning new vocab. I would absolutely recommend using this app with other vocab learning apps, like Anki."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Was great at first, but now that I am advancing, it is not very helpful. While it has you memorize use of words in different context and tenses, there are no explanations of why or language rules. I am constantly trying to figure out when changing tenses why some words you use on o and others you use an e or an a. Good for memorizing a language but not very helpful in understanding the structure or rules of a language. I think they are trying to make this a game rather than a tool."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Duolingo updated the course yet again and shuffled around all my progress but yet again they failed to teach me these words and phrasesthat apparently I'm supposed to know. So now there are even more questions that I don't understand but are popping up in the leader board challenges and other exercises. Extremely demotivating and annoying. I'm reconsidering my Super subscription.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am just shocked how most of the lessons in almost all the units are organised. When you run out of heart to use, you can practice even more to gain heart I've learnt a lot from this app but the only short coming that I think it has is that you cannot get to know your (Quest) buddies unless you've meet in person or know each other from somewhere It would have been good to have some quest that you can complete with a friend that is active. But all in all, this app is Maverick. Merci, DuoüòÅ"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it's a great app. the graphics are cute, the layout is user friendly, the repetition makes it easy to pick up the language. that being said, the Match Madness excersizes make me want to kill myself. but whatever. I suppose I'll get more gems so that I can keep buying the time boosters because there is NO WAY TO DO ALL 4 MILLION MATCHES IN 1 MINUTE."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great way of learning a language. The hearts system is confusing and the badges thing should be optional. There is just 1 thing that would bring duolingo to a higher level: there should be buttons all over a lesson that would explain the grammatical rules of each practice. I am learning French and I'm not sure I make the same progress I would make if it would explain the complex system of times, clauses, and silent characters. After 50 days I still have to guess most of the grammatics."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,been on DUOLINGO for about a year and some change took a two month break and came back to a pretty decent update. Vikram radio is cool and a welcome edition. I just wish I could play pass my 5 hearts. :: (update) I can practice as much as I want and still level up!!! Duolingo is a great learning experience and also very fun.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I feel like the ads after EVERY lesson are a little much, and you should learn numbers, conversations, and greetings BEFORE learning food and accessories. Other than that, the app is pretty good, I've had it for nearly 5 years, and it's helped with my German and Italian quite a bit."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Makes learning fun and easy, but I wish they would explain grammatical rules instead of leaving you to figure it out through trial and error. I would also enjoy using a vocabulary practice feature. Also, they insist upon using homosexual references and situations, which isn't typically enjoyable for people who don't subscribe to those beliefs, and shouldn't be included if children also use this app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love Duolingo, but I'm not a fan of the recent updates. Also, the courses for languages that aren't major languages like French, Spanish, and German are hit-or miss. Latin is short and low-quality. Danish (my language of choice) is a hot mess - the English sentences are poorly edited and rarely make any sense. Not to mention that even though I'm on the family plan with two others who can access music and math, I cannot because I have an Android."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Most recent updates to the app taking away predictive text makes for a poor user experience when a user knows the sounds of the words they're trying to spell in lessons, but may not necessarily know the spelling. Additionally, the shift in focus from humans creating lesson content/practice help to AI doing those things has tanked the quality of the language learning experience. Incredibly disappointed in the changes that have come through in the last year or so."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I was a long-time user of this app casually. It was never an optimum way of learning a language, but used to be a nice way to supplement other learning methods. However, Duolingo has become progressively worse recently. Firstly, they removed all grammar explanations from the app. Additionally, and increasingly, previously free features are now behind paywalls, and un-skippable ads play frequently. The result is that duolingo is certainly not worth using now."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"While it's a decent system to do maintenance on a language, I don't feel like it's the best to learn an actual language. Recent changes made ads ridiculously long and make the app experience just a chore. It's all a bit expensive, plus is not worth the money. I might be done with this."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Working great but I wish there was a setting to disable the exercises where you have to write / type words or whole sentences. I can't install another keyboard, already have 3, and I also don't want to learn how to write the language, just interested to read, listen, and talk. The constant writing exercises make this cumbersome. Not fun."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like Duolingo so much. It's an excellent way to introduce us to a new language. Even when I support the gamificating as an funny way to learn the app doesn't necessarily must be focusing on competition. We need a part where grammar be explained, please. Guessing the way a sentence must be written is frustrating. So, less competition and more explanations. Thank you."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's fine to get a basic on pronunciation but if you're going to try learning a language with a very different grammar structure to English you're eventually going to stall out on here and have to find another source to learn. Throwing sentences at people with no context on why one works differently than another is not helpful at the end of the day.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's really good for learning languages, I'm learning gaelic but considering the spelling is always not what it seems and there's a lot less gaelic letters than English it's kinda confusing when they throw in random names, as well as the fact the audio is very low quality and seems poorly recorded when listening to words for putting a sentence together. Aside from that really bugging me, I enjoy the app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After the recent update, I can't play because it always says ""you are offline"" even when my wifi is on. I'd like this to be rectified and what's up with the constant update, New problems keep arising for me after every new update. With the new update, the app just got worse, I can't practice, it keeps closing and now my streak has been reset, I think I'll have to delete this app it's becoming a total waste of space"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app has been crashing a lot lately, especially when loading tests that you pay 100 points to start, or when playing ads, which wastes your time when you're running timed XP boosters. Also, the Russian course does not recognize numbers spoken into the mic, even if you cheat and click the button to replay the sound clip that shows you how to pronounce the numbers in Russian right before you click the button to record your attempt. It makes you fail any speech lessons involving numbers."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Not one of, it's the best app I've ever used for learning languages. Its definitely not like the other apps that bore you to death and make you feel like your as useless as a life guard in the desert. Since it's designed like a game, its not only gonna keep you consistent but also gonna help you to learn which language you want, whenever you want. Let duo cook."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Messy update ! I was about to conclude my Italian course. I knew exactly which modules to achieve and suddenly after the update all the remaining lessons dissappeared. It turned into a kind of a review from the beggining of the course and in a few lessons it came to an end. All my effort to keep until the end, finito!!! Over 900 days streak I've accumulated within 2 years of subscription simply faded away!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really love Duolingo, it makes learning a new language fun, easier and quicker. I like the streak system, the different modes of learning (writing, listening, selecting). I love how there's also an option to select 'Can't listen right now'. I feel like Duolingo in a sense has revolutionised the speed & learning languages. The challenges, leaderboard, badges and quests keeps engagement and a sense of healthy competition. I've learnt so much in so little time & felt so accomplished!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really like Duolingo. Learning Dutch and this is the app I keep coming back to. It's fun, has great variety, and keeps me engaged. There are a few annoying things, like: 1:45 seconds for Rapid Review is not enough time. It feels intentional to get you to buy time extensions. Not mandatory but the completionist in me weeps everytime I see those empty stars. Numbers are also difficult for the voice recognition (at least in Dutch) Overall though, very satisfied. Ik kies jou, Duo!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"overall, I enjoy it. i wish there was more one on one conversation to test skills. like chat bots. i also did not like that my whole course was changed with no heads up, and I know because I double-checked my email. I enjoyed the course more before the change. now it seems overwhelming."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"a fantastic app recommended for all no question! however as advanced foreign language speaker finding it hard to tailor the curriculum to my specific needs. breezing through most of the levels, occasionally picking up a new word or concept, being unexpectedly challenged before dropping back to basics. a more advanced AI might be able to cater to the learner's level more quickly and accurately and facilliate more targeted learning? still, one of the world's greatest learning tools. thank you"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is a great app if you already do know the language you want to improve or know a language that is similar to the one you want to learn. It is also good enough to learn a basic conversation level which can he useful. it is not a replacement for learning grammar / pronunciation in a classical way. The quality of the spoken language differs from course to course. The most widespread european languages seem to have a very good level, but you are stuck to one ""dialect"" like Parisian French."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's not perfect but it's free. It sometimes makes mistakes and mixes up words like pen apple and house but only rarely. It's possible to get infinite hearts without hacks but you still have to watch 1 or 2 seconds of every ad. I was gonna buy it when it said it had monthly options but when I went to pay it only takes yearly payments
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have 3 issues. I paid for a year subscription, yet the app is blocking me from accessing my account due to a bug in the app. The app is drilling the earliest words over and over while only repeating new words a couple of times. 3rd, I'm trying to learn Chinese and I find it does a terrible job at teaching both pinyin and the chinese characters. At this point, I think simple flash cards would be much more effective."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was a literal rock at learning languages, I even had severe memory issues, Duolingo fixed it all! I am already learning languages fast, easy and happily without any difficulties!, it is easy to use and highly motivational to help you keep going! I hardly knew ever a letter in the hangeul (Korean) alphabet and only 2-3 words, but now, I have gone from 0 to 45 in nine days! nine days only! if you don't have a teacher then Duolingo is definitely the place to start your language learning journey!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good but with lots of technical problems. I'm learning Japanese and there are numerous problem, words don't should correct, words and sounds are mismatched, there is no attention to the pitch control is the audio files which is a big part of Japanese. Sentence structure is not adequately explained, you can not use the letter drawing part of the system which is a big help learning it and some other problems but otherwise good"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really love learning languages with Duo. There is much variety so that it doesn't get boring. The only reason that I didn't put 5 stars is because I would like there to be an option to choose, for example, European Spanish or Mexican Spanish. In the end it seems to teach both because I have seen multiple words for some things, but as I travel to Mexico often for work, it would be nice to tailor the learning in that way. All that being said, I can't think of an easier, more fun way to learn"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Duolingo for 5 years and it used to be really good, I used to get responses to feedback on whether sentences were correct or not, users could interact with the lessons to review what was an error among ourselves, and there was no consequence for taking your time. Now that's gone. It's clear how much AI is used to write the lessons and when AI gets it wrong there's no way to inform the app about it and you're forced to continue the lesson incorrectly. It's a shame how much changed"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Great app to start with but as i move further up the levels there is lot of written questions what isnt very helpful for learning if you have dyslexia like myself its put. Me off the app and learning i would like to see more spoken and put the letter in the correct place exercises. Or maybe put an accessible option on the app.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, but I don't love how they reorganize lessons when you are mid unit. It may add more to the program, and I'm all about improvement, but it really makes it difficult when previous units that you ""completed"" now have vocabulary and concepts that you never learned and you have to try and double back to learn them."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've used Duolingo for quite some time, and coming back to it has been awful. I understand the need for ads, but this is just insane. Ad after every lesson. And almost every ads is telling you to get super Duolingo. Because nothing says learn a language like pay us $12 a month so you don't have an ad every couple minutes. There's using ads to stay up, then there's this."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app used to allow you to read up on some aspects of the grammar in the upcoming lessons, so that you could understand what it is you're supposed to be learning. Now, if you get a question wrong you just have to guess why. Duolingo is serviceable for helping you memorize some vocab, but nothing much past that. What it really excels at is teaching you to memorize an answer and spit it back out."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I pay for the family plan. Using for several years, an engaging way to learn a language if you have only a free minutes per day. A big compliant is that it occasionally forgets my progress, i.e. wipes out months of effort to complete the levels. Very frustrating. Just did it again and since last time they were not very responsive to my direct contact I am making this public post, which I would prefer not to do."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Personally, I love this app. It's totally free to use but comes with ads, but that's not really a problem for me . You get a free week of super duo, and that helped me strengthen the base of my learning with additional support such as no ads, unlimited hearts, and things like that Overall, great app 10/10"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"used to be good learning app when i started with it few years ago but with updates the course progress is basically none, repeating boring, absolutely nonsensical phrases and situations, (there are also wrong translations which are not getting corrected after flaging, AI doesnt care..) , there is way too big hurdle to skip lessons to topic you are interested and i could go on. Also more and more intrusive animations TLDR: used to good, hard to actualy learn anything now, no grammar explanation."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's amazing how things start sticking in your brain with plenty of repetition. Fab how you feel young again as you manage to work things out. I like doing bits of very different languages to challenge my brain and to learn at least a little about the sounds, structure and writing of them. It's great how much you can do for free. Thank you to the creators!! üôè"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,In my opinion I see that duo is a very goodapp for learning any language and its one of the most rare apps that if you tried the upgraded option it will give u a super experience in learning any language and it makes u hear the language from different sounds and that's incredible +it always reminds u with your daily streak which can help u reach your language goals but I wish that you can make the microphone a bit better cuz sometimes it doesn't give me the accurate check of the words k.going
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really loving the app and the way it teaches you, its like having your own personal teacher! My only issue is that it should have a section where you can see all of the ""words"" you have learnt. Ideally in the review section under ""Your collections"" alongside ""mistakes"" and ""stories"" should be ""words"". I dont understand why it does not have this. Also since the latest update it is having serious trouble trying to hear me speak in speech lessons, before I had no problems with it. Please fix this!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"If you are trying to learn a more unusual language it really doesn't help at explaining either the grammar or structuring of the language. The words aren't always pronounced especially if there are 2 words in place of one in English, the slower speak seldom works, which makes it difficult to understand. It seems that it is a one size fits all approach to language learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I was learning chinese, but recently, the course seems to have updated. The sync that happened wasn't done properly and the course has worsened. I just started unit 3 of chapter 1 before the update, but now this unit has been shifted to become unit 1 (which doesn't make sense). The biggest problem is that Duolingo thinks I have completed the current unit 1 as well as a part of unit 2, while I had only done one circle of unit 3. Now I can't continue learning properly. Please don't delete units."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"fantastic, has voiced words mostly from what I've seen, with some A.I. filling in. lots of repetition and callbacks, fun little characters that are animated but don't interfere with learning, great stuff. ads dont interfere, just sometimes played at the end of lessons - catchy little ads for duolingo plus, wish it wasn't so expensive... you can totally still learn without it but it would be great to support an app that makes it so easy to learn"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Fun, but the competition to complete lessons can be too distracting from the actual learning. Pop-up suggestions on how to remember what you learn are good tools. After completing several levels, still can't speak to anyone who knows how to speak Spanish. Lessons go quick, and knowing how to create and speak sentences in Spanish for a conversation is slow. Reading and writing Spanish developed quickly, but lessons make it easy to guess. On it's own, this app probably won't teach fluent Spanish"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Was a great app, was very thorough and lots of material. Has ads but they're actually not that obtrusive. Unfortunately this app has deteriorated, with previously free features being stripped away, poor running with features load-locked and gems being taken for exercises that either won't load or won't complete. This is likely to push people towards super, which I actually would've bought if not for the poor quality. If it weren't the only place to learn Welsh, I'd avoid it entirely."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Fantastic app and a great system to learn a ton of different languages. The free version is completely tolerable and you can learn a lot even without a subscription. I ended up buying one after using it consistently for a year and it just makes the learning process more seamless. If you need things ""gamified"" to stick with them, this is the language app for you :)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Learning has never been this fun! I am learning Japanese language through Duolingo for past 15 days and it has been an awesome experience for me. I have not gotten bored or overwhelmed. However, at some places things can get repetitive but can be used for revision. I only urge the people at Duolingo to (ku da sai) add more Indian languages apart from ""Hindi"" which is already present. I wanted to learn ""Telugu"" my native language, but couldn't find one."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The basic idea initially seemed very promising, could have been perfect. But regrettably the infinite patience of the machine is driven to an extreme, resulting in an incredibly slow learning pace. The same handful of sentences are repeated over and over with very little, if any, new material introduced. As if the over all goal is too keep the learner stuck with the application as long as possible. That was really not what I expected when I enrolled."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Very easy to learn a new language with super duolingo. However, there is no way to get technical help or contact a rep. I lost a 1560-day streak because of a phone issue, and after many failed attempts to find customer service (I don't think they have one), I could not resolve the issue and lost the streak. Also there did not seem to be a way cancel the account,and they continued to charge me.After about a month my old info miraculously appeared, except for the streak. I dunno..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is nice to keep up with practicing but really suffers because you can't choose what to learn or focus on, and it really only does one kind of language learning. I am also not motivated by the artificial mechanisms that boil down to just allowing you to practice more, and all the gems and streaks and ""competition"" don't meaningfully affect the outcome of my learning. I pay for the app, and don't want all that not-what-I'm-here-for clutter and menuing."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Used it for a few months a while back for Spanish. Picked up again recently and not the monetization is pushed way more heavily. It'll throw a single word that's new, no sentence for context, and ask you to pick what it is and you lose a heart if you get it wrong. I end up just thinking to myself what the answer is then clicking the question to reveal the meaning to check before submitting my answer. Still good, but used to be way better. Rating low just because of how much worse it feels."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Since my first review more than 2 years ago I'd still say it's a good introduction to a language. Using the free version I must mention though that it freezes constantly, starting after about 2 lessons. As this doesn't happen when I get the occasional free days of + I assume it is to do with the ads interfering. This has been happening for the past half year or so."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"generally I like the app and it helps me motivate to learn despite busy life.yet I find some part of interface unintuively placed but most of all I'm missing the lessons - regular readings and explanations, beside learning by choosing. it's also better for total beginners and quite boring and discouraging if you already know some language and whant to skill up. podcast app is only for iPhone! and nag screens about the app are diaplayed on Android - what is it? free apple add?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall I like the app, but I don't like that you have to guess your way through a lot of lessons. Would be nice if there were multiple choices rather than to have to write a whole sentence. The spelling of words is the most difficult part. Also the option in each section where you can collect extra stars should actually pertain to that that section as a refresher and not be random."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Learning Chinese. Great app but very little to no focus on writing. Reading, writing, listening, talking and character recognition all shows improvement from the app. UPDATE: changed the number of gems for events from 10 to 30, another blatant move towards money grabbing, also just feels like app is trying to force you to chase XPS to stay in the leagues, instead of learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I studied linguistics in uni, so I thought I could always learn languages better on my own. I didn't really know how Duolingo worked, but once I tried it, I loved it. Fantastic language learning app. The only thing I wish there were more of were more opportunities to practice writing and speaking at lower levels, and not just direct translations, but ways to challenge us to actually make our own sentences."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love it and would give it a five star rating except for one thing. It keeps saying I'm offline, even when I'm not. My network would be fine, with very other app would be working, but Duolingo would say I'm offline and I'd lose access to my lessons. I've ruined my streak because of this problem. I dunno how to fix it"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm already bilingual, and decided to learn a third language while practicing my second language. It offers a great balance for new learners and the ability to jump ahead to your current skill level. I seriously appreciate the pace. I do wish there was a French Canadian option since spoken French is different between the two but hopefully at a later date."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app used to be very useful. However, since the interface has been changed, it has become not much different from other apps, which is very disappointing. It used to be very flexible in determining answers, and best of all, you could type in answers from the keyboard. However, those features no longer seem to be available. I don't even use it much these days, but Duolingo has inspired me to learn other languages, so I guess it was a good software in that respect."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a really good app for learning languages; I would recommend. Update requests: Add stories to the Indonesian course. Morse code as a language. Also, Pig Latin and Auslan (Australian sign language). That would be really nice. Thankyou! Or dare I say... Terima Kasih :) P.s I haven't for a while but I have had a few scam ads... Dk if that was fixed so just thought I'd let y'all know."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"it's a fun way to learn, but like in a pay to play kind of way. there is an advertisement after every lesson regardless of whether it took 1 min or 10 and half of the adds are to pay for duolingo in order to skip adds. the non duolingo adds are skippable after about 5 seconds. However, the duolingo adds are unskippable and 30 seconds long amd every other advertisement. im convinced their business model is trying to annoy you into either paying for or dropping the app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a great app for learning a language and has great potential, but it gets a bit repetitive after a while, and most children these days don't have a long attention spam so they'd get bored quick while hence making learning much harder or even none at all suggestions I have 1. You can learn similar words first if possible and/or letters in the alphabet (if it is in another writing system) 2. Save streaks during famous holidays, cause it's harder to learn whole with your family on Xmas."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Duolingo. The app has taught me a lot of vocabulary and useful phrases, which is what I expected, but using it often (a few times a day) has given me confidence to speak Spanish to native speakers in both my work and personal life. The ads are annoying, but you can upgrade to Super Duolingo and blah blah blah. Despite the ads and my frugal app spending, Duolingo is great."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I already know a bit of Spanish, and having a bit of time on my hands, I decided to give Duolingo a go. I am extremely pleased I did because my Spanish has improved dramatically. This method of learning has really reinforced that which l already knew, but more importantly, is advancing my understanding, vocabulary, and accuracy of the language. Give it a go."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Spanish - 5/5 Japanese - 2.5/5 Japanese course: 1. Severely underdeveloped (for ~7 years now). 2. No speaking exercises. 3. Awesome new kanji feature, but no way to select and practice the specific kanji you want; you can only practice the ""family"" it's in (grab bag of ~10 kanji). 4. No way to ""test out"" of kana or kanji, so seasoned learners suffer, stuck practicing beginner/well-known characters instead of the ones they need. 5. Can't test out of a single level, even if acing it. Frustrating!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's ok, but it seems to rely on participation awards and shaming, which was pretty off-putting for me. I'd prefer it was more positive without being patronizing. It seems intent on pointing out mistakes and weaknesses, which often aren't weaknesses in reality (how do they come up with them?) And sometimes the mistakes are a clumsy thumb. I wish I liked it more."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"1)You give the double experience and then take it, and it doesn't count. It happens too often! 2) I often push ""can't speak/hear"" button by mistake! And I can't cancel it! Add the ""cancel"" button to overturn the changes! 3)The feedback on pronunciation would be great with the wrong sounds outlined"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy the lessons but wish we could revisit the whole of each past lesson, especially the stories, for new vicabulary and practice. There is short-term memory that only familiaruzes the student with the grammar, vocabulary, and idiosyncratic expressions. In order to fully and readily command any language or skill, repetition is imperative, or those previous lessons will be lost."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'd give super Duolingo 5 stars because I'm using the free 3 day reward right now and it's so fun and helpful. This is what learning should feel like. I'm giving Duolingo, the free version, 4 out of 5 stars. My only complaint is the crystals. I would prefer no crystals to do legendary challenges, but if there has to be crystals at least reward each lesson with enough to do a few legendary challenges. Either that, or let personalized practice be a free feature. Other than that I love it!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a good language-learning app, it just doesn't give you enough education in the language. And it is sometimes unhelpful, such as how the Arabic course teaches you a rarely used dialect and the Portuguese course only teaches you Brazilian Portuguese. But overall it was pretty helpful for me, I just don't know where to go to become fluent without having to pay."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Pretty good to learn a language, but the heart system needs to be reworked. The main problem is that if you lose all the hearts, you have to pay 450 gems. This means that if you make too many mistakes (which should happen if you're learning a new language) you get punished for it. The only way to avoid this is if you buy a subscription for at least $7 a month. And it's the fact that in order to learn better you have to pay, that kind of makes me want to quit Duolingo and look for an alternative."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great for learning about different languages, I really enjoy learning about Portuguese. Takes you in slow, steady courses, and is sure to help improve whatever foreign language you are learning. Not sure what all these other reviews are talking about, saying this new version is impossible to do, but it's very encouraging and fun for me. Would definitely recommend, even to those of younger ages wanting to learn another language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is probably 5 star, but I can't tell yet. The gamified learning environment is amazing! This keeps my interest Soo well! You learn words that all go together (like vocabulary to learn a full greeting) and this app has very high repetition! The con is I feel a bit stagnant in repeating the same words sometimes and learning slow, but that's probably a good thing. There's no interaction with other learners or people in other countries aside from leaderboards (that I have found). Enjoy!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,0 üåü they just updated the Chinese & it's all new stuff I've never learned. instead of letting me learn it as new it has it marked as review so I get 5xp instead of 10. it doesn't teach new words and hints are missing. words that have been taught 3+ years are now different. I reported issues for Years & nothing changed. now everything is different but they aren't allowing us to learn it as brand new. I pay for this and I'm really disappointed. I used to recommend this app. I don't anymore.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to enjoy the app, leaning a new language was fun and excited. but it sucks that you guys care more about money than providing a good, (mostly) free, accurate language learning app. getting rid of translators to use AI has made it unfun and annoying. hearing words pronounced incorrectly, being told my answers (which I know are correct) are wrong, the accents are odd, etc. I am undownloading, and will consider re-downloading if you bring back actual, human translators."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Japanese Section 2 Unit 5, when you finish a lesson the progress circle doesn't advance and your next lesson is the same one you just did. The only way to work around it is to shutdown the app and start it again, then you can see your new progress and start your new lesson, but when you complete the new lesson, the issue happens all over again and you have to shutdown again."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Unfair system, making you buy more. I have been a fan of Duolingo for years now and have made progress on learning different languages. Just recently I have bought my premium. I find it frustrating that the app would freeze on me from time to time. Especially during the time I have a Double XP on. After finishing a lesson, specifically during the listening game. I did it twice and have froze on calculating."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Has been very good up to now but it seems to have a major glitch in last 3 weeks and I'm stuck in a Groundhog day loop constantly repeating Unit 6 of the Spanish course! This happens after a screen message appears stating: 'We're syncing your progress to new and improved Spanish course content.' it's very frustrating. I've contacted Duolingo support but have not received any answer.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"it would be good to be told the rules as you go along. There used to be some help guidance but that that seems to have been removed. And also it would be nice to have an adult's version rather than teenager. Duolingo talks too much about things like teeth braces, exams, what clothes go with each other and so on. Not really very useful for adult conversation. Oh and it's very American. You have to learn two languages as you go along! I've slowly reduced my score because of these things."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Been using it 2015. But recently the high pitch voice of Zari in Japanese lessons really difficult for me. She is perpetually screaming everytime. I know the developers are trying to imitate Japanese animation characters, but it's really uncomfortable for people who are sensitive to high pitch. Please tone it down a little, real human don't speak like that."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to be so happy with learning on duolingo. It was a great way to learn the grammer of languages, and was extremely accessible for people to start learning. Even though it had problems, they seemed to try to improve their program. However, I am extremely disappointed that Duolingo has fired 10% of their language staff and replaced their knowledge with flimsy AI generated content. I want to learn from people who know and speak the language, not a fallible computer program. Very dissapointed"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Been a paying user for three years, but won't be renewing again. Suffered through two horrific updates that lose progress and make learning an absolute nightmare. I've tried using the new path and it is horrible, you get introduced to 20 new words at once and then don't see most of them again for weeks. Now comments section has been removed so there's no way to know what you got wrong, just have to guess and try again. This makes it impossible to actually learn a language outside duos phrases."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've been pretty happy with this for over a year now. I'd give 4, maybe 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that I'm losing what I've learned because the app is focusing on my ""five weakest"" (most commonly mistaken) words. As in, to the point where I don't get anything in five out of six lessons per day that touches anything but those words. I'm getting frustrated with that. I can almost copy and paste three answers to get through the daily review right now."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,(Downgraded from 5 stars to 2) I hate the new path. I've lost a lot of my previous progress and the lack of choice and inability to choose topics has made it boring. Previously it felt like a serious language app but now it looks and feels like a child's game. Perhaps the developers intend changing their target market to under 12s? Jan 2024: removed another star after yet another automatic downgrade wiped out a lot of the progress I'd made and badges I'd worked really hard for. So demoralizing!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Got the option for a 14 day trial of duolingo super. Duolingo promised they would notify me 2 days before the trial ended, in case I decides to cancel. I never received the notification about the trial ending. None of the emails I received recently had anything to do with it. I cancelled super the same day I was charged, and was told I wouldn't be refunded. I attempted to reach out to their customer support via email, but haven't received a reply."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The new update is pretty good. I love Duolingo. It has taught me so much. It is my favorite language app. The new parts where you have to listen and then answer a question are great. But, I have been using Duolingo for many years, and I am missing some of the older features they had. I liked the comments section where you could find an explanation. Also, the lessons at the beginning of each section were more detailed. It really explained to you what was coming in the next lesson."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Duolingo for years and have learned a good deal of Spanish. So, yes, I recommend this app. That being said, I am occasionally frustrated by the lack of explanations for some things that I don't understand. There is also a problem with being overly encouraged to do a lot of lessons in a day, to a point where it's becoming more about quantity of exercises than quality of learning. I think I'm starting to plateau in learning as a result."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to be a great app before the ""new learning path"" update back in 2022 (?) ... This update made me loose all my progress (it didn't correctly assign what I have already learned) and I miss being able to jump back to a specific topic for revision. Now that the old version is not supported anymore, duolingo is no more worth a subscription."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I think I really did learn a lot. it's not much yet and I would love to keep going, but I can form basic sentences in my chosen language now. the characters and style of the app is adorable. premium is cheap, it genuinely works, and having a long streak is cool too. you get rewards and can have friends. definitely recommend for anyone. perfect for first timers and people with some experiences, to anyone like just wanting to touch up your speaking or spelling in a language. üíû"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,good learning app. I have done Ukrainian for 3 years and can converse a bit with some Ukrainian speaking people. it's a fun game but I wish they had the old version back. I don't really like the new update. Also French stories are really good but it is now harder to access them. other than that it is a really good app that is fun to learn on. Kid friendly unlike Memrise.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Not a bad language learning app. Lots of repetitive lessons. But the notifications are ridiculous. I have uninstalled the app before because of the absurd amount of notifications through both device and email. This is my second go around and I've had to unsubscribe from the email listing. It's free and so far accurate so you get what you pay for.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I loved the app at first, but the more I use it, the worse it gets. At the start, I was learning lots of new words and phrases. Now, I get like 1-2 new words a week, the rest of the time just repetition. On top of that, it completely messed which words I've learned - some words I've already seen, and I get them as ""new word"". Others I've never seen, but it just assumes I know them. It feels more like a waste of time now, rather than a language learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is a great way to start learning a language. The gamification and streak count keep you motivated. But you can get a perfect score without actually learning the vocabulary, especially in later lessons. The platform could benefit from flashcards and passive listening practices where you don't have to be looking at the phone."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really love Duolingo, and have been using it for a while now. I learn Multiple languages and I'm finding it's coming along quite well! half way through Spanish and just started Hindi!!! Mucho gusto! Thank you. If I could change one thing though, I'd say maybe that it could teach you the accents aswell? That would make the words easier to say as most people have an accent. I mean I just feel like I'm not using the proper accent for some of my lessons üòÇ but it's still a 10/10 experience"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Cool app to practice some language skills and build basic confidence. I wish I could rate it higher, but at this point the app is more a mobile game rather than a language learning assistant. I really miss some features like: - Ability to build your own dictionary. Ideally with integration for adding new words to the list - More explicit topics for theory and practice - ""Forgetting curve"" reflection to optimize the learning process - I also really want to see the Serbian language in the list"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"They used to be pretty good, but now 90% of what you practice talking about is nonsense. Like for ""learn to tell stories"" it's about how a cat washed the floor. Subjects aren't real places or even fake people, it's just stuff that would never come up in conversation. I just have OCD about keeping a streak, but I have another platform to actually learn useful conversation."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app overall is great, however the speaking aloud into the microphone portion is terrible. It tell you your wrong and cuts the mic often before you've even had a chance to start speaking or as you've just begun to say the first word. Not a great app for learning how to pronounce languages aloud but definitely good for learning how to understand languages. I'd say practice speaking aloud with a friend or native speaker instead. But overall I'm enjoying the rest of this app and I do recommend."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,it's an amazing app that makes me learn so many symbols and letters in many countries but I wish they could have added basics and how it sounds rather then learning a word really fast without even knowing the basic sound and alphabets of the language but I'm still very impressed and comfortable with the app its an app where you could improve better and I know a lot because of this!! just hope it takes my advicee
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Japanese: This app is good for a couple of weeks, but it forces everyone to learn to read hiragana and katakana. Very quickly (unit 3) romanized pronunciation begins to disappear, which makes it impossible for users who only want to practice listening, because you cant do the exercises without being able to read the prompt in hiragana/katakana. I filed bug reports but never got any help from developers."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"There are a lot of glitches with streaks and the freezes for them, but the app is easy to use and enjoyable except for that. Edit, I'd also like it if I could undo leaderboard league ""fixes"" or at least that there was a check in there.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Too much repetiton, often answers are limited to particular combination of words an sentences. Progress is too slow. Many ads. I don't feel that I improve my language much, skipping to topics or levels you would like to try its nearly impossible, tho whole level feels extremely easy, but misstakes are counted to their very specific way of translating the sentences, its very inflexible and not smart at all. Stakes system is horrible. No regular updates or improvements. And much more..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a great concept and is incredibly engaging in how it gamifies learning a language. But it doesn't give you the tools to start speaking essential basics of the language right away. Rather, it seems like it took a Kindergartener's curriculum and converted it into a language course; teaching obscure animals names at the start instead of how to converse about someone's day, order food, or ask for directions."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy lessons, reminders, challenges, notifications. There are all kinds of exercises, you speak, translate, guess, match pairs of words. Rewarding experience. I suggest to try it at least one week and see how you will progress. It's been awesome so far. Honest review."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Good for learning. But some issues. I pay for it but leave heart's on so I can try harder to learn, but I can't do practice to recover more hearts when I pay for it like the unpaid version. Which is annoying to lose functionality after you pay for something. Also I like the animations on duo but don't like samsung animations when changing apps. And if I turn off the samsung animations it turns off the duo lingo animations. Even if it is toggled on in the settings of the duo app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love the app! I have been using it for very long time. The result depeneds on self-afford to get a good one, hahahaha! The lessons, I think they are for the beginner who do not know where to start. So they may not accurate with the native speaker. Cross-checking is needed but the app is helpful though. For my experience, the way this app taech makes me rememer the words like many of them."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Pushes their super subscription every time you make a mistake, you will make lots of mistakes and every time you run out of hearts you have to do an annoying and repetitive exercise for 2 hearts, and that is if you watch an add after. Once again, trying to get you to give them money while taking away from the learning possibilities."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"XP earning system and ""leader ranking"" is a pure money-making setup. No-one can finish the Word Match challenge in 1:30 min, and you are constantly encouraged to purchase additional ""pearls"" to buy more time. They should focus on teaching, not ways to make people pay more or compete. Second, especially while learning French you constantly (!) get examples about Russia and China. l mean - what the heck? These are two oppressive aggressor countries, and these are the only ones you can mention?!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is falling off hard(paid for the year). Had it for 7m and has steadily declined in features and feedback. I get ""new"" words in unit 8 that I learned in Unit 1. Then I'll get new words out of nowhwere that I'd never seen. There are too many little glitches like this to name that add up for a increasingly worse experience. Slowly but surely this app is getting bad. A chat room for users would be AMAZING. More context for masculine, feminine and suffix changes explanations would be great."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"inconsistent with what passes as correct answers, (spelling errors etc) will auto select answers so you get wrong answers and lose stars. Constant ads. They just want you to pay for subscriptions. I've also been told by finnlanders that this isn't the language/ grammar used for actual conversations. In my opinion if you can afford it go with another app"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"If you haven't used Duolingo for several years, take another look, especially in Spanish. There is more in the app to teach you the language from beginner level then there used to be. I wish the app still allowed users to discuss the questions and answers, because I used to learn a lot from reading those discussions. Now I can't even see them."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app! I'm a visual learner and the audio lessons, YouTube, and even flashcards don't work for me. I need to see the written word in a context and associate it with an image in order for me to assimilate new vocabulary. It works better for me than Memrise does, because it covers the grammar and Memrise doesn't. Duo also has stories and mini games which make the language learning more entertaining, which is a key to success for an ADHD person like me."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have enjoyed using duolingo for over a year now. Though I haven't appreciated some of its more recent updates. It is slowly becoming more game style and less educational. But after trying other language apps, I've still always come back to duolingo. It doesn't teach you the language rules, etc, but I find it very helpful to learn new words and help me stay familiarized with the language as I learn it through BJU's curriculum."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app has mostly worked fine, but lately, I keep passing level 30 in French, starting level 31, only for the app to reset overnight to level 30. Then I jumped ahead to level 32 and did a couple more activities, only to get reset to midway through level 31. I have no way of contacting an actual person over this and can only submit a bug report that just gets an automated response. I'm not sure if there's any point to using this app going forward."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app that's suffering from questionable decisions. Duolingo can be a very useful tool while learning a new language, but they've disabled the ability to converse with other users to sus out what understanding is missing in lessons. Recently the Italian course was updated and I had to delete my progress in the course and start over because everything changed."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Updating review, I'm saddened once again to find out that the Japanese that I'm learning isn't fully correct . After some research I found that duolingo is using AI for most of their practices now and not everything is spelled or translated correctly. I'm having to revise my notes and relearn a few things in other apps or watching YouTube videos. If your going to attempt to charge people please make sure your teaching the correct spellings and translations atleast."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"App is generally great but falls down badly when doing speaking exercises with short (one or two syllable) phrases. It often fails to recognise short phrases, across several languages. Tested this with a native speaker in Turkiye, where Duolingo failed to recognise him speaking his own language. The result is a long list of ""mistakes"" you can't get rid of. EDIT Feb 2024: There are still issues with voice recognition, but it seems they no longer appear as mistakes which need to be fixed."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app for non-paying subscribers. There are some features available only to paying subscribers. However, I think it is still worth your time. One con that might annoy you if you're a native English speaker (perhaps also if you're learning English as a foreign language, although I can't speak to that) is the number of comma splices the app includes in answers or questions. In my opinion, that's unacceptable and a bad example for language learners. (Former foreign language teacher here.)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Still can't do any of the speech related excersises. It just switches off as soon as you open your mouth and says that doesn't sound right when you haven't even been able to speak in the first place. I do however like the way it teaches you a language only wish I could choose mother tounge rather than learning from a second language...
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app to start learning a new language with, I'm currently taking Japanese. However in my case, I find the yearly subscription to be unaffordable. There should be a lifetime purchase option, I'm not a fan of recurring payments as I have a tight budget each month. Oh and there's ads every two minutes in the free version."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's fun and makes learning fairly easy, but there isn't a coherency to the lessons like in a textbook. You learn a lot of random words in each lesson. Not like a greeting conversation and then family words and food words, etc, like in school, but random. Still, I'm trying to trust the process that I can speak sentences in 6 months with some conversation. I'll update again later if it does work out."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What happened??? Why get rid of predictive text??? I'm dyslexic and need predictive text for regular English, there's no way I can actually learn a language without it. There goes my over 200 day streak. Real bummer this has become a part of my daily routine but now that it's not accessible, I can't put the additional time and effort needed to do lessons without the predictive text features. Really truly disappointed."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I WANT TO USE THE JAPANESE *KEYBOARD* - I'm a subscriber and up to Section 2 of the Japanese course. One of the first things I did was disable Romanji, but I still feel like I'm just learning Duolingo rather than Japanese. By that I mean, there's always just a few choices and it's pretty easy to eliminate some choices and remember patterns to get answers. But this won't help me in the real world where there's countless possibilities and I have to actually understand. I need freeform input!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There are problems with both the language I am learning not being presented correctly and with the English used. There is no learning of grammar rules, and it can be very repetitive. The app itself is also very unstable and will hang frequently, which is especially annoying if you lose XP during a 2x period. There's adds after every lesson but half of them are from Duolingo themselves selling the Super or Family plan. However, overall, it's a fun way to learn basic phrases of a language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's a decent app when you're just starting out. Mostly it's memorizing phrases and words. I don't love that you have to guess and do some deductive reasoning to figure out the grammar rules. It would be nice if there was a short grammar explanation for some of the lessons. I get a lot of lessons done perfectly because I have a great short term memory but I'm not sure how much this will help in the long run.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"On an 1870 day streak in Japanese. Every update makes the app worse. The move from the 'tree' to the 'path' was the worst, but they are constantly messing with it and making the user experience less enjoyable and satisfying. Losing Discussions was terrible, knowledgeable people could put phrases in context, but no longer. Only habit keeps me going, but I am learning nothing. Busuu, here I come! By the way, notice a complete absence of replies to reviews by duolingo? That says something."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Update: they charged my credit card a renewal but didn't credit the app. I have contacted their support email several times with absolutely no response. I sent a copy of the credit card payment again, crickets . The app was better in the beginning. Now it looks like it's written by 12-year-olds. Very woke, many many ads."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like duolingo alot and have learned alot of Russuan from it. Its not just random words, but collectively you will eventually use all of it. It is also engaging as well. The only part I don't like is the constant pressure to by premium. You can certainly learn without it, but running out of hearts make the process slower. Overall great app and would recommend"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great for beginners. I haven't used it to learn more advanced topics but it's a great collection of words, pronunciations and phrases to get you thinking in the language you wish to learn. Edit: lowered from 5 to 3 stars due to the recent update removed gboard's predictive text. This was a poor decision. Without this, there's less benefit to using the mobile version or to pay for a subscription. Second edit: raising back to 5 stars since they quickly fixed the issue with predictive text"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"In 35 days with Duolingo, I've transformed daily language learning into a fun, engaging habit. Its user-friendly interface and gamified approach kept me motivated, significantly improving my vocabulary and grammar. While it's just the beginning of my language journey, Duolingo has been an excellent starting point. Highly recommend for anyone looking to dive into a new language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Update: I've been on this app for a while now, however the formatting they have taken up in recent years is disappointing to say the least. Older features such as coments/ explanations underneath each phrase as well as older lessons breaking in order to properly review them are the very reason that kept many productive and knowledgeable within their learning. The constant push to ""upgrade"" to premium is detrimental to the community to say the least. I will continue to use in hopes they change."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I was particularly impressed by the free trial. The learning format is like a game which encourages participation and progress. I was only put off by the price manipulation. During my trial, the annual subs amounted to USD 33.33. Yesterday after the trial ended I was offered a year's subs at a 60% discount, coming in at USD 26.67. Meaning they doubled the normal price to USD 66.66 FIRST - and then offered a massive ""saving"". Just for that I'll not subscribe, although I think the price is fair."

""we don't handle refunds - talk to google"" Predatory app design with cancellation features intentionally hard to access. The app told me it would remind me to cancel my trial before the trial period ended and it didn't do that. I normally put a notification in my calendar when I trial something but figured the app could be trusted - my mistake!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is very good and I love a competition to get up in the league. but I don't rate 5 stars because sometimes I can't hear the small letters in a sentence but you just need to slow it down and you'll be fine.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I miss when my feed was all about my friends accomplishments and less about random duolingo articles I do not care about. I want to see what my friends are doing and send congrats to keep ourselves motivated, not learn about soccer and football. The translations have also been a bit weird lately, as someone who is mostly using the app to review/keep up practice with a language rather than learning from zero. The app used to be better."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,You had a good app! With lots of lessons! You don't need to keep making new ones and changing your layout for no reason! And now you fire a huge chunk of your translation staff and replace them with AI making it even worse? It should be easy to finish a course and just host it for use! Almost two years. But if I drop my streak now? I think I'll just uninstall. Why pursue language education from a service that doesn't even use human translators. For shame.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I want back the old language tree where it was easy to skip units depending on the previous knowledge one could already have. That's impossible now. Since there are always two units connected together into one double unit, I have to go through a unit that I already know to learn things from the other unit. This inability to plan my learning makes it so ineffective for me. This doesn't allow me to have any spaced repetition at all unlike the previous tree."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Loved this app since it's early day and it keeps improving for the better. It would be nice for native speakers to sharpen up on their own language like English person learning English. Loving the math and music on iOS and excited for it to move across all platforms as well looking forward to future lessons. Also, to the developers, I really admire how you take your time to refine everything you bring out before adding additional languages etc üòäüíï"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's easy and fun but your going to make mistakes and they want you to pay to not worry. I get a lot of practice and I'm learning Italian and Spanish and im mostly doing Spanish and its fun and easy to understand. Awesome app for language learning and with super duolingo I've been able to learn Spanish and several other languages and it's a lot of fun. Love this app. Easy to give 5 stars for helping a guy with a gunshot to the head to learn another language and help other people. TYSVM!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app for about a month now and I've made a lot of progress. I like the overall design, and the leaderboards, which are quite competitive at times, boost my motivation to get one place higher or beat that person before me. But I do have a problem: I'm learning Japanese and am currently learning my first few Kanji. I am not told what the Kanji actually mean, and I get to draw the same Kanji ten times in a row and then skip to the next. Some variation would be better I think."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Had a basic understanding of Spanish like he, she, hello and goodbye. The first few lessons were a breeze and it builds up your understanding slowly and definitely if you start at the beginning. It uses many different teaching techniques through the lessons so you get a good grip of how the language works. Pictures, sentences, fill in the blank, multiple choice. The best free app I've found. Also has other languages than Spanish! I get the same satisfaction as if I'm playing a mobile game. 5‚≠ê"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"1 year re-review. Relearning Spanish from English. Free version is fine (I paid). Duolingo is improving, but slowly. Do not use the current Chinese lessons. Spanish is different all over the world, much like English. Some aspects of Duo's grammar are far removed from Mexican Spanish that I was taught in school (which you'll encounter most in the USA). I recommend it, with caution, as being a great helping tool for Spanish. Expect errors, unnatural accents, low volume lessons, loud ads. 2024."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this app! The lessons combined reading, speaking, and listening. The progression is natural in terms of level for Korean, and there is emphasis put on learning syntax through repetitive sentence styles. I use this app in conjunction with a vocabulary app and I have progressed 6 levels in 2 weeks. It's also excellent for review for advanced Korean students."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I learned over the past 14 days basic sentences in Dutch. so instead of wasting time on non sense games, using the time on Duolingo is really beneficial. The only drawback is that it lacks explanations of the basic rules of grammar and spelling. for example, I don't know what is the difference in use between ""Het"" and ""De""... the plural forms also are a bit challenging as well as the negation. I wish it had any part academic with explanation of the language rules."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Better at some things than others. The gamification of lessons helps encourage me to do them, but unfortunately I'm running into errors I recognize e.g. bad spelling, even as a beginner. There are also random times where the app bugs out, like when only one word is available to choose when you're supposed to pick the meaning. There are other language apps I think do a better job of teaching, like LingoDeer or Memrise."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"honestly, really great. I feel like this app has come a long way from back when it started. full disclosure, I did buy into a year subscription to premium to avoid the obstacles of losing hearts (so no fear of mistakes) which is probably helpful to feel motivated. it's clear though that they've very thoughtfully structured and sequenced exercises to ensure that you're learning similar words adjacently to let you organically discover and recognize subtle differences. good app"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Having finished the first 8 units in Japanese I feel the app is too slow and repetitive with iffy translations that have no decent explanations to help memorize what's being taught. Could be easily improved but won't be happening since the start of this year they have replaced chunks of their staff with AI. Music and math courses still aren't available for android user's making it feel like the full-year subscription for plus I accidently payed for back in October is steadily losing it's value.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Some days I love Duolingo. Then I remember that it's teaching relies heavily on a learner failing and I get demotivated. I'm British learning French but Duolingo forces American English on me, with sentences that are completely alien. There's a tool to report the anomalies but your efforts to report them are completely ignored. So I'm on the fence. Can I recommend it? If you like the brutality of motivation through demotivating then yes. Otherwise, stick to the free version and keep sane!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm really confused, I am learning Chinese and all my lessons just completely changed. It says I have done 3 when I had actually done 5. And the ones it says I have finished are completely different content than when I actually did them. If you are changing the lessons I would appreciate a heads up, and accurate credit for the lessons I did. And new lessons for the ones I didn't do."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm currently learning Italian with a 79-day streak. Duolingo is a perfect app for learning a language. However, the notifications do tend to get annoying but it does get me to do a lesson. It's funner when you do it with your friends because it'll give you quests and you and your friend can complete them to get extra gems and you can give your friend gifts too."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I got the option to try super duolingo, and it said I would be notified before the trial ended and I would be billed, I wanted to cancel before that as I don't need the super version.

So I practice this game every single morning so I can learn a lot of new words! I rate this a 5 stars!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Seems like it would be useful if you are going into a language with zero experience, but I had a lot of Spanish in school, my vocabulary is poor, but my grammar is good. I'm stuck going through early portions, they have a way to skip ahead, but it requires you to write sentences with difficult vocabulary, so I'll go through most of the test with zero mistakes, and then fail at the last few questions because they use a word I don't remember"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Make a few mistakes and you are penalized so that you cannot try again without paying exorbitant fees. So rather than learn from my mistakes and continue, I have to quit and am discouraged from trying again. I'll find a different program that helps me learn without penalizing me for not learning fast enough. How fast? Well, brand new word with accents I've never seen and made a spell mistake... Too bad! Try again.... Except I won't. I'll be installing and using an alternative."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is great for learning the language. The only complaint I have is that there is no way to temporarily opt out of the competition side without losing ground. And since there are better ways to earn points that doing lessons it leads to problems, especially when you have vacation or a busy week at work."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Duolingo for just over a year with about 8 months of premium - It's been largely effective at helping me learn my target languages, however the perpetual lag that the Android version has from the iOS version, constant feature cuts, and consistent issues with speech recognition cause the app to fall short of ideal."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app for learning foreign languages and has lots of fun and varied learning techniques, like stories and speaking experiences (unfortunately theys aren't available on certain languages). The only problem is that it doesn't focus on grammar much so you probably couldn't learn to speak a language fluently just using Duolingo. But overall it is a great app!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Works better then before but there is an issue with updating courses. Whenever ther is an update to a course they ""adjust"" your progress and fling you in the middle of some unit where you have no idea what is going on. They assume you know the words, frases and grammar for that and all other previous units, but in fact this hampers your progress and even affects games and events. Unacceptable!"

I've been using Duolingo on and off for years, so I don't lose everything I learned back in school. There's always been encouragement for daily practice but now I feel like the emphasis on the streak is overwhelming and discouraging. I had to delete the widget because I would be off the app for a week and it'd show me the owl dead or angry, which makes me just not want to look at it or open the app."

At some point, the audio starts teaching the wrong pronounciation, it got to a point every day I ask my Japanese wife if the audio I is correct or wrong. And I started worrying about practice which make permanent of mistakes. There is a report button, but no response for your feedback, and when no way of indicating if it's the sentence or the words (sometimes audio mismatch)."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's really good! The activities are fun and interactive and terms stick with me outside of practice. I'm learning Korean and I'm feeling good about it. But some things that would be important to the language aren't taught. I've been having a hard time with different sentence structure that isn't explained, and I also used a different app to learn the alphabet better. Besides that, I think it would be cool to add new courses. I've been wanting to learn Icelandic but it's hard to find a good app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The interface can inadvertently switch out of keyboard mode mid sentence, leaving the submission button as the only control available.

The next similar sentence was incorrect with nunca at the end. Why?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is free, actuallyteaches you a language, and works with any schedule. I like that it has very different types of questions (some are matching words to pictures, some are write what you hear, some are translate this phrase, fill in the blanks, speak the phrase... and more). And each tiny lesson mixes the types of questions so that it doesn't get boring. To me it feels like a game, but to my husband it feels like homework; so while I absolutely love Duolingo, it isn't for everyone."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The free version is more than adequate and the adverts are not excessive. Lessons are very simple and repetitive to ensure learning.

At the same time they still keep missing the places where the Topic is undefined in Japanese and then provide you options of multiple references points but they only want to see 1. Oh, same also applies to singular/plural. If you can't get basic grammar concepts right, don't blame the learners!

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been using duolingo for more than 5 years and and am so frustrated by the constant design and feature changes. They took away community comments, which were crucial for understanding context and usage for tricky words and phrases. The design has become more cartooney and the level progression is tedious and unhelpful. They don't acknowledge feedback or provide any sort of opt-out option for unnecessary design changes. Every update makes Duolingo worse andI have grown to hate this app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Fine app for beginners, but not ideal for people with intermediate knowledge of a language who are seeking to improve. There is a ""pre test"", however, it does not properly assess your knowledge or place you accordingly. I've taken 2 years of Japanese and was hoping to learn new words, and it's instead teaching me the alphabet. There is no way to skip it. I found it does this with every language that has a foreign alphabet."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"practice practice practice, makes perfect. The balance of listening, reading, writing, and speaking in each lesson makes this app more than worth it.

I really do enjoy the app."

Yes, I can usually work it out, but it slows me down (and many challenges are timed in duolingo) and is confusing. The language I'm learning often shares words with British English, that I then need to translate to American!

I do recommend doing the membership it allows for unlimited attemps, where the free method you get hearts and with each mistake you loose a heart. When the hearts are gone no more practice. Making the program not as productive or beneficial. The repetitive nature is the key to learning a new language."

I pay for premium the least you could do is adjust the audio. Also I get a lot wrong answers because the app is often grammatically incorrect how you gonna teach someone English if you don't know the difference between 'used to' and 'use to'"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is great if you just need a gamified way to remind you to do some learning everyday eg when learning Japanese characters or your first words, but the explanations are not very good and the exercises doesn't teach very well, eg ""of course"" gets translated to ""that's obvious"" so you have no idea what those words mean in other contexts. Finally they regularly change around course content which messes up progress so it thinks I know words I've never seen before."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've been using it for 2 weeks and cannot give more than a 3 star rating. The app itself is well structured with stories, listening and speaking modules, but the content had much room for improvement. Please consider the following: areas, which I've learned well keep coming back, and it is really a waste of time to have practice words and phrases I already know with no option to skip or remove. Or the app cannot well 'evaluate' weak and strong areas of the person learning a language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I last signed onto the app 3 years ago. I detested the mandatory dark screen then. Good news, that is not mandatory now.

Though I can still suggest one thing to duolingo, You need to add a SHOP section to your app to claim the chests and see how much you have to wait more. Also in the SHOP section we can buy hats, etc. and race with other people on who can complete the same random lesson first."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"In light of Duolingo replacing the majority of its translators with AI, I will be uninstalling this app and giving it a suitable rating. Great gamification model and very attractive and streamlined app. It used to be wonderful as something to use on the side while learning a language, now, just use flashcards. Those pieces of paper won't have their soul ripped out for marginal profit."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"At first, I was enjoying relearning French on this app. However, the Hearts system they have is irritating, so I'm going to find a different app. You are allocated 5 hearts when you log in each day. When you make an error you lose one. When you run out you can no longer progress. You can backtrack, practice or watch an ad to earn another. As you progress, the allocation appears to get smaller. If you've managed to stay on, you can expect tricky questions to get you off."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"New to the app but like it so far, very thorough in go over subject matter several times to make sure you are solid on it. Encouraging and fun for someone like me that needs that type of thing. I like the humorous stories, they are cute. for being free, it's pretty amazing. I'd love it to be more personalized, so I may go for the paid version at some point."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I loved the app. It's just like a amazing game that is very interesting to play. I have learned my language full before practicing in my school. It's effective. It also tells the rank,the league type, achievements, following, followers. But now I am not able to open the stories lesson. When I am trying to open it, its always loading"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The errors with registering lessons as complete, lag with general app functions and garbage quality of learning are the main reasons I will never recommend Duolingo or use it again ever. The quality of translations has gone down dramatically to the point where it no longer makes sense as a language learning application, I would delete my account but you're made it practically impossible these days."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy the app, and lessons are a good mix of fun and challenging, but frustrated that I use the paid version while Android users don't seem to have access to Music/Math at this time. Also have issues with 30-min XP boosts from friend quests disappearing when I select them, rather than actually giving me a timed boost."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I just started the app. I did have previous experience with Spanish the language I wanted to learn first. I didn't feel my knowledge of Spanish would be enough to start at a harder spot so I started at the beginning. The app does offer the option to test your knowledge for a starting point too. I just wanted to start from the beginning. I am still using it on the free play plan. Using watching ads to keep it free for me. Mi espa√±ol es improving but I haven't learned it all yet. It teaches to rea
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Learning a lot, but do get annoyed by some of the silly sentences/examples that try to humanise animals. The hints obtained by clicking on underlined words are often very misleading too. Often the app is slow to open. We British have to translate from the American English - often actual words or sentence construction is completely different from British English. Errors in the program are not corrected despite being reported on numerous occasions - I have 'two mistakes' that can't be corrected."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very good. This app provides you with a lot vocabulary and after a time you can build long sentences and learn a language very quickly. Duolingo is also very colorful and has systems like streaks and your stats that motivates you to keep learning a new language. Me personaly having a Spanish class, it really helped me get a head start over other students. So if you are looking for an app that really teaches you a new language, then Duolingo will not let you down."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It is very good on the whole. There is a great variety of exercises in each unit. The odd English sentence had an incorrect structure or word usage. Some of the content was not functional enough for my needs. I would and have been recommending Duolingo to many others.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Devs could think more about league allocation. My husband is very competitive.He will play as long as it takes to stay at the top. He often gets put in easy leagues so he doesn't have to do much = less adverts. I am less competitive. I get put into challenging leagues with superusers where I'd have to play full time to succeed! So I do the minimum as I know there's little hope of advancing = less adverts. If the leagues were better set, we'd both do more = more adverts, happy users & advertisers"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app used to give a lot of support in helping you through trouble areas e.g there was a forum where you could ask questions about a specific problem or when the app noticed a spot you were struggling with it would give you tips. These both seem to be gone now so it's more difficult to learn and progress using just the app, now I need other resources."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I tried to learn greek with this app, and have been using it for 6 months already via payed subscription. It feels like I can spend my time more effectively. The example phrases sound like AI generated and are not useful in real life. Also it's really annoying with all these achievements, diamonds and notifications. Thank you duolingo, but no."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is so good. It lets us learn new languages. It is fun as you can connect with your friends and learn together through leaderboards and friends queats. And there are achievements and rewards which can we earn just by taking few bite-sized languages lessons. It teaches you not just writing and reading but also listening and speaking. If you are going to learn a new language, I recommend Duolingo gladly, and don't lose your streak Merci beaucoup!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo could be 5 stars if not for several bugs that have yet to be fixed. First priority: fixing those sentences in Listening exercises that have no audio at all. Second: those sentences/phrases in Speaking exercises that *never* hear one say them correctly (usually it's the shortest, easiest phrases that make it obviously a bug). Thirdly: instances where either more than one translation is correct IRL yet not accepted and those where audio could be singular or plural, but only one's accepted"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo, once cherished for enhancing my French, has deteriorated since IPO. The new tree faces widespread criticism on Reddit, resembling a game rather than a language learning app. Users are bombarded with constant introductions of new concepts, and writing exercises are scarce, reducing language learning to word selection. Dissatisfaction pervades social media, signaling a shift from effective learning to a game-like format. Opting not to renew my subscription, I'm exploring alternatives."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I have loved this app and been a user for the past decade but have noticed some bugs that should be fixed. The app glitches frequently and restarts and freezes often. I've reported these glitches and they do improve for a short time. It makes me not want to purchase the Duolingo plus edition. This really sucks to write this but it's true. Also lessons no longer have a proper grammar section that would enhance the lessons. Just sentences that are vaguely similar to that lesson.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've used this app for three years, and it is less helpful than other similar apps - especially these days. For Japanese, there is no explanation as to what any words mean prior to them throwing random sentences at you, it's just guesswork. The structure of the course changes almost weekly, so you can't easily review previous words without something random either being added in or removed."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Korean: A bunch of the audio files for Korean are really really bad, they are glitchy and jittery sounding. There is no way you can learn Korean using this app alone. It can be a good supplemental source when using something else as your primary. However, these corrupted audio files can still be very frustrating and unhelpful. I would say absolutely do not pay for this app if this is the language you are wanting to learn."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like the notifications and incentives it provides for you to reach your goal. My issue is when I complete a lesson, I always have to exit and clear it from my history and reopen the app for it to update that I've completed a level and go to the next lesson. It's great that I can learn more than one language at a time on here as well! A drawback is that it doesn't always provide the English translations for Korean. So, I'm learning Korean words. However, I don't know what they mean in English."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Here's my review for Duolingo: In my experience with using it I have found it to be quite a useful app. First impressions were five stars and it is still true. Very easy to use, good interface. And the characters are really fun. And no you will not be attacked by Duolingo like the Internet says. I am currently learning German and I can now pronounce many sentences. Great app!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Solid for learning words by themselves and I would definitely describe the app as addictive. However, other apps offer a wider range of languages (Serbo-Croation is not apart of any major language app, Duolingo, Babble, Rosetta Stone etc.) But an app like Mango Languages offers Serbian AND gives better Grammer, sentence structure and cultural context. I'm sure if major apps like Duolingo put in the effort they can easily fix these deficits."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I like it, it's productive, but last time I used it suddenly the order of the lessons were changed. According to it, I completed lessons that I never have. Or the tests had words that I didn't learn. I can't use it when it changes like this. It's frustrating. Please don't change the lesson order. It feels like someone else was using my duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"a really good language learning app. i appreciate the creators who made this app. the app is built in such a wonderful way to learn languages in a good way. I don't like steaks in Snapchat but Duolingo steak is compulsory. I've been learning spanish for almost two years now. even though i was away for a long time from duo , he still waited for me hoping I'll return someday. this app reminds you constantly to come and study the language. I'll give 10 out of 10 rating for duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am using the free version for French and learning a lot! Practicing to earn hearts is a good thing, but there are lots of opportunities with the paid version too (I won 3 free days), so you will be able to achieve your language goals with either one. The app could benefit users by making a ""theory"" tab or something to teach users about the finer points of language use (fem/masc, plurals, origins, etc). One has to dig a bit for this knowledge in the app. Tr√®s bien! ü¶âüíö"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's one of the best language learning apps for beginners. The teaching pattern and course is always upgraded to make it as methodical, engaging, and comprehensive. It is designed to make the learner very thorough in the language and has come a long way since I started using it in 2020."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I use to really enjoy this app until the hearts came on the scene. Sometimes I have accidentally hit continue when I'm not done and I lose a heart. It's just an attempt to get users to buy Duolingo Plus. Not gonna happen here. The app now has a glitch that won't let me progress. It goes back to the beginning of that unit . If it continues then I'll drop it.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Used to be a good app, but they've expanded the engine so much that now it constantly crashes unless you have one of the latest devices. I'm in the top 0.1% of users, but I'm about ready to quit. I have to restart the app after every lesson. Granted, it's free and a good way to become familiar with a language, but it's easy to fall prey to their participation contests. Paying customers have huge advantages. If it works for you, focus on the learning alone. I've been doing Duolingo for 5 years."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great idea to gamify language learning. Frustrated with changes they make to the app without considering ramifications entirely though. Have also been hearing for over a year about their adding music lessons, and I'd love that, but so far nothing. It's inexpensive though, and I find the annual fee worth the money to eliminate ads."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have honestly been experiencing a 4.5 star rating with the app to this point (only deduction is occasionally needing to restart the app to see my progress, or because it crashed). But Duolingo did a major layoff and is using AI to save money. I have a language degree. I stand with those who are doing the language work. I will now be closing my account. Willing giving up my over 1 year streak. I used duolingo since my studies for that degree. Goodbye."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"For nearly a decade, I've been a top 2% competitive user across 10 languages. Every interface change causes a setback, leading me to cancel my premium subscription and cease competing. Alternative language learning methods, & conversations are key. I particularly valued Duolingo's inclusion of different alphabets & translatable stories which they've limited greatly. When my 535 day streak dies ill be partially sad but also relieved and will move on from the app entirely."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"0 Stars. So disappointing...Glitchy to the point it's unusable! Have used Duo since 2014 with no problem, recommended it to everyone! I finally purchased a yearly membership appx 2 yrs ago and once it expired I've had nothing but trouble from the free version. It glitches/crashes out every time I use it, predictably it happens once I get a timed boost or on my last heart. I've uninstalled a few times and retired on different devices, I want to love this app!...But it Sucks right now!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It helps me because i tend to race through without paying attention to everything. The constant repetition makes me aware to what i am not paying attention. It makes me listen, read, write. I have tried other apps. This format is the best for Korean because the sounds and characters are so similar. You are not learning conversational Korean just to get by. You are learning to write, read the letters and to understand the differences in how we make sounds."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good so far, lessons are well paced. I like the reviews I can do for the previous unit I completed. I wish there was a lexicon to use or a dictionary to have off hand based on the words learned so far. I am experiencing the issue where the rapid review causes the app to stop receiving input once the time runs out. I submitted a ticket and am waiting to hear back."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Progress reset, came back after a while and all my progress on japanese was reset and the new system of hearts is plain ****, the grammar hasn't improved a bit and i can understand adds but the constant interruption is extremely disruptive a small add could have been set at the very bottom of the screen generating revenue without interfering as much as it does now"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It is the worst! For the free day trial when it would remind me before it ends two days before it didn't! Plus when I put or spoke the right answer it said it was wrong! It doesn't even make a fun like a game!Plus with the hearts I just can't! If you lose all of you hearts you cant learn anymore! I find that very sad yet dispointing!Wouldn't want to waste my time on this stuff! I don't recommend it for you guys! One last thing I had to pay more for the free trial!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is fun, it keeps moving, but at a pace you set for yourself. Learning German for me, will take time. But I find this app is just right as it's enjoyable and you make it what you want by challenging yourself to the next steps. I look forward to each day, either for new challenges, or simply going over what I have learned. I like the cartoon figures and after a while you learn how to utilize more things within the Dulingo App. I am actually surprised by the diversity and how it works."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It is very helpful. I love it because it is really concerned about teaching one very well. It will always remind you and remind you. Sometimes the duolingo icon usually change . This part is even very funny. This is because of the fact that the change is usually based on your learning activity. It therefore gives one this zeal to learn. I have alot to say but I'll stop here. I love you Duolingo. Keep being the best. Muahüòò
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Not a bad way to learn a language if you're just starting or if you want to dip your toes in the water. Lacks vocabluary, pronounciation practice, or effective methods of reviewing content (the last one is available if you pay), but over a long period of time it can teach you the basics in an easy to understand way. Recommend if you're not already bilingual to some extent."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"In the 5 days I've been trying to learn Spanish, VERY HARD FOR. SOMEONE LIKE ME, but duolingo makes it very easy to learn, they go step by step, word by word, mistake by mistake, it will definitely take a while to learn but duolingo makes it go by so fast because they structure their app so well and makes the lessons in a game type forearm, if u want to learn a new language duolingo is ur best option if ur wanting to learn on the go, in the comfort of ur home, THANK YOU DUOLINGO."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good app. I use Duolingo to improve spanish, and because there is no option to choose my native language, I have to choose english as the other one, although I have to improve my english as well. Because of that, sometimes it is very confusing and difficult to understand at first, and than to translate formulations, such as, for example: Luis siempre se pone vestidos rojos?! I know it's a dress but I doubt all the time. It makes me unsure and unsecure. Beside that, it is fun and useful app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is helpful to start a language, but it's soo full bugs. The rewards system gets mixups all the time and after a while it's really demotivating. Like in every hour you could watch a short ad and get some credit, but most of the time the icon for it just doesn't appear, or you don't get the coins. Also, the quests are often miscounted, the rewards you would get every 100day just dont happen, so its really annoying. Also, the level of the lessons doesn't always match the level I'm at."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It absolutely infuriates me did I lose my streak in less than 24 hours but, because the clock changes to a new calendar day. Seriously, I lost a streak in 8 hours or less. the streets are nice. they keep you going. however, Duolingo doesn't seem to understand the concept of what a day means"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Timed challenges are either too easy or impossible, there is no in between. Challenge timers continue while voice recognition is 'thinking'. Won't warn about free trial expiring but will continuously send notifications at all times of the day and night. Super is the only way to compete on leaderboard and advance to next league as each challenge costs gems($9.99 min purchase) without it. Don't trust the free trial's promise to warn you 2 days before you're charged $120(it charges yearly)."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really enjoying this. I'm engaging with the program much more than I expected to. Extremely innovative and immersive, tons of variety, plenty of dopamine rewards. The only downside is that there are no audio-only lessons for Android users, and as a professional driver I would LOVE that. It makes no sense why IOS users get them & everybody else doesn't. I'm not switching platforms just for one app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's been a good app over the years to learn a new language. However it's got its faults. The path keeps changing and some of the sentences make absolutely no sense. It doesn't go into depth or explain the different congregations of the verbs. I still remember the basics from being in an actual class so that's helped alot. Other reviews explained its faults better than I can and they're right in my opinion. This is minor but the heart thing is absolutely stupid!!!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a fantastic language learning app that deserves a 5-star rating. It makes learning fun with its gamified approach, keeping you motivated with streaks and leaderboards. Plus, it's completely free and flexible, allowing you to learn at your own pace anytime, anywhere. As a beginner, you'll find it an excellent resource for building vocabulary and grasping basic grammar in a user-friendly way. In short this is the best language learning app"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Many of the practise phrases are in the wrong order pedagogically. In language-learning a learner should hear the phrase first, then fill in a single word gap in a phrase, then reproduce the phrase after hearing it spoken. Finally the learner translates the full sentence from English into the target language. In many of the sections, this final phase comes first, then the other, less difficult phrases follow randomly. This happens throughout the Italian course and needs modification."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"so far, almost a month in and enjoying it. even just regular ""practice"" rounds when you run out of hearts/don't want to do the stepping stone course counts for a daily practice, which is really helpful. they do well with repetitive routine to help you remember things better and go over mistakes until you get it right. definitely worth it currently!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So far, this app is amazing. The actual language learning part is pretty good, but the thing I love most is the fact that it only teaches you actual words that you would need. I used to learn Spanish at school, and my teacher taught me the most useless stuff imaginable. Now with this, I learnt really good phrases like how to order food or get a taxi. The only slight problem is that I did miss my streak one time and I live in constant fear of a particular green owl 'coming for a friendly chat'."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app that encourages free learning with great social aspects. However, desperately needs a catch-up mechanism when they revise their curriculum, leaving you with a whole set of new vocabulary that you were never taught... Seriously disappointed in that respect."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've tried a number of similar apps even though I was sceptical at first I tried this one. I was impressed, it has become quite addictive as well, I want to ensure that I keep up with the daily lessons. I am using the free version at the moment which I find adequate at the moment. Just an up date. There are parts were the spanish speaker is to fast to follow ,or two words were too similar to answered correctly."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Really appreciate how detailed and pointed the lessons are. Excellent app for language learning. Just a suggestion, for European languages, kindly take into account the fact that some of the learners are not Western or European, and so they may not know certain names of Cities, Flags, Monuments, Celebrations, etc. This can easily throw someone off if they are used as a hint in the exercise."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Earlier Chinese lessons were changed to have new vocabulary. I think that's great, but Duolingo is constantly showing me words that I never learned as if I already know them- it thinks I should know them because I already completed those old lessons. I know of no good way to go back and learn these new words because I already made the lessons legendary. Keeping it at 1 star because Duolingo tried to steal 80 USD from me for a 2 week 'free' trial. They are snakes."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Every time I complete a lesson, I get the three dots loading screen and it never goes away.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Once an amazing learning experience, slowly curtailed by the removal of features like the forums (which were absolutely incredible and taught me far more than the main courses ever did) and grammar explanations. Now, they have fired almost all of their translators and are letting AI provide much of the content, with disasterous results in some courses (e.g. getting completely the wrong readings for kanji in the japanese course). I have been a user since 2014, very sad to see its current state."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"its slowly been updated from a learning program to more of a language game. additionally, the way this app teaches you is not very effective. while the lessons are somewhat engaging, they can become repetitive/predictable and lose their effectiveness in actual conversation. you're able to decipher words from other languages, but may find it difficult to speak competently to others in your language course. i think there should be more excercises teaching you how to form sentences independently:)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Used to be a great app, wish there was sign language. Now, with ""super Duolingo"", I find the app less amusing. It is so unnecessary, yet you think I need it. At least include tailored language ads for the language I'm learning, I think it would be nice to know real world things in this language. It is very boring to see the same ads asking me to buy super. At least change them up or something instead of keeping them the same"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Very disappointing for a paid service. I miss the message boards that allowed learners to interact and learn more about a topic. App will frequently be glitchy and not register that I played on a day forcing me to use a ""streak freeze"".

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is by far the best learning app for learning a different language. It helps me in all the ways that I need to learn.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love duolingo! It covers a variety of scenarios and a variety of teaching methods (listening practice, writing, and speaking). And it has several incentives to keep learning, such as league rankings, earning points you can use, and the ability to build a streak if you practice religiously. You can follow your friends and have the ability to congratulate or nudge someone along to encourage their progress, and even participate in friends ""quests"" to earn badges etc. Its üëç"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Structure and lessons are good, but the dynamically created lessons that are supposed to be tailored directly to you and whatever it is you are struggling with are completely broken. I often forget words that I have learned because they are never reviewed, and my top 5 most struggled words are always wrong. Unit guidebooks do not have a complete list of all the words learned in that unit, which is especially aggregous considering there is no way to review all words learned."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have a 610 day streak learning Russian. Ever since they updated to have the new quests/'improved' courses, the quality of learning has dropped. I no longer enjoy these lessons and each day feels like a chore to complete the tasks set. I do like the mini games, but It's a shame what the management have done to what used to be a fun app. I would not recommend this app but especially not for russian, or welsh learners"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Pretty decent. But the ads after every lesson and limited hearts make learning a language needlessly harder. I only got the ads after going onto the app and haven't checked the web version since, so maybe that version doesn't have as many ads. Also, if you run out of hearts,then you either need to gain more through paying with crystals (things you get either through quests or irl money) or doing some practice for one more heart. If you run out then you stop. Overall, it's not the worst nor best."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I really like the app. it has a funny reminders that keep you in check and keep you pushing to learn the language you chose. I'm learning Japanese so it's really fun I can cheer my friends on and it let's my take my time so that I can fully understand the words and how to pronounce it. I know it's already doing so much but I would hope they would add like a flash cards so I can practice aside from the units of all the words I learned. but all around a fun and good app.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have been on Duolingo since last January, almost a year. I am on level 8 and there is a bug that does not permit me to check an answer. I have reported the bug but there is absolutely no communication as to what action if any is being taken. Very disappointed with this app. To continue to learn Spanish I will have to try another app. I was making progress learning Spanish and frustrated by the way this is managed. Terrible!! I am dissatisfied and would never recommend Duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"200+ days: Not an effective way to learn for me (rote memorization).UI elements too small. Paying but no replies to bug reports/issues, ever. Gamification/animations got irritating Grammar/honorifics explanations thin and/or inconsistent No explanation of kanji: how to write, radicals I find it infeasible to memorize 1000+ kanji without that context Especially on mobile fonts are too small, no way to adjust. Makes kanji illegible. Reported all of this to support, no response."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It was good during the novice stage. But in the second stage it expects you to know things it hasn't taught you and then fails you. Very fustrating. And it gives guidance on how to translate that it then rejects as an error!! Hasn't got any better. Still can't suggest the correct answer half the time
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Every time I finish a lesson, it just sits and loads loads and loads. It doesn't go anywhere. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling and restarting my phone, but it doesn't fix it. I am almost ready to uninstall it for good again! Other than that, it seems to be great. It works fine on my daughter's phone. Also, it's not counting toward my challenges, so I'm not getting credit for anything I do."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's great to commit to the daily habit of learning, but your progress will be limited by the easiness of some skills and words that keep repeating even after committing for 3 years. sometimes I wished the games took into account the vocabulary that are more difficult to learn so I could really remember them"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Probably the worst language learning app available. Overly punative because the app is designed to push people towards a pay subscription instead of focused on teaching language. This app is, at best, a supplemental tool to have in your language learning toolbox. At worst it is counterproductive. You will never achieve fluency with duolingo. Never. It may help you achieve an A1 level of basic fluency. The sentences are weird and not useful. the speech recognition is highly flawed. Try other apps"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I've been using duolingo to learn Mandarin for several months and it seems like more and more pronunciations are AI-generated the further I get into the course material. It makes it incredibly difficult to learn the correct pronunciation. The duolingo pronunciations cut off at weird times and sound robotic. I would love for these words to be recorded by humans.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I do not understand the software development and testing process they use at Duolingo! Honestly! For years and years we see the same problems coming back all the time. Currently, the problem is that Today's review is stucked to Listen-up. I did like 20 of listening exercises in a row - it sux! Killing Duo is not helping. Alo, all books are marked read when I arrive to them. Kind of difficult to get daily achievements! Argh!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is a very enjoyable way to learn a new language. However, the frequency of the ad screens are ridiculously high. I don't want the Super Duolingo tier because I actually enjoy the restrictions in the free one (limited number of lives and higher cost of the legendary challenge). So what I do is I practice till I get an ad (which means one or two lessons, sadly) and when it pops up I close Duolingo and continue in other apps. I would spend more time and money in Duo if there weren't ads."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Was really enjoying the app until the last few days. Seems there was an update that caused an issue where I'm stuck on the same lesson. It keeps repeating and won't let me move on. Very annoying. Not sure how much longer I'm going to be willing to keep a streak going if I can't actually progress anymore. üòí
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy the learning in a game, it's very engaging! It is fun, and the sound effects motivate me to continue playing. However, the gems you can win to continue advancing to higher skill levels is RIGGED to force you to pay money for more gems. And the coast of more gems is not reasonable at all. The coast of certain things is so ridiculous relative to what you recieve for it, and their are challenges that can't be beaten without paying for more time, which is un ethical for a learning app. üëéüèø"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's great to learn new languages with, but lacks explanation when you get to the possessives and plurals. Other than that, it's great especially since we get to learn more languages for free (Granted there are a butt load of ads but they at least they don't interupt you in the middle of your lesson which i appreciate.) They make it competitive and to where you want to beat the others in the league. üòÖ My friends and I will go ham trying to beat everyone else out of the leaderboards."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"great, easy & convenient way to get back into a language (Indonesian in my case). Kind of wish I could choose what themes / topics to focus on. Starting with culture and religion wouldn't have been my first picks. But it's good to see how much I remember. Occasionally translations are a bit pedantic - ""how many Buddhist students in your class?"" is taken as wrong. ""how many Buddhist students ARE in your class?"" is the ""correct"" answer. But, a small glitch in a good app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is really good. I like how if you can't speak into the mic or listen you can tap the ""Can't listen right now"" option and it'll give you the option to listen and talk into the mic 15 minutes later. and when its teaching you new words for one lesson it'll focus mainly on one word, then in the other lessons it'll include new words and old ones you've learnt. I'm learning German and I've had this app since yesterday and I already love it. strongly recommend duolingo!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"At first I loved this app. But a year in, and I'm getting utterly fed up. It begins failing your answers for the stupidest of reasons, continually running you out of hearts and gems, so having invested a year of your life already, you are more likely to get your wallet out. And I'd happily pay, but not more than I pay for Netflix each month. I've checked my failed answers on translation apps, and they are correct. I'm also sick of the updates, which completely changes where you were up to."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,App is very good except for recent leaderboard challenge changes. I am now competing against people learning different languages with multiple years of experience that are racking up 10 times the amount of points that I can after hours of lessons on a daily basis. I find the changes discouraging as even when I make in app purchases I have no chance of competing against those with 4 - 10 years experience in the app. Ugh!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great App for learning, the free version would be 5*. With respect to Superduolingo, however, I don't think this is an improvement on the free version. For the free version, the 'practise to earn hearts' function is great for revision. This is removed for Superduolingo, unfortunately, and the practise hub isn't a comparable substitute (lessons are too easy and repetitive). If Superduolingo can improve the practise hub and/or add the earn hearts function for Superduolingo, then 5* again."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,So far I've found it very helpful After using the app for a month these are three things I would like added. 1. I would like more personalization. A lot of phrase don't apply to me so once I complete a unit I'd like to add details that apply to me (I'd be fine with using it to deliver better ads). 2. I would like to add sentences I've seen and want to learn maybe using the camera and have that be broken down for learning. 3. With Japanese once I've done a Kanji I should only get the Kanji.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Lots of content, awful as a primary learning resource. It used to include explanations for most sections, as well as forum threads for each question so you could see explanations and tips from others. Now there are no tips, and the forums were finally outright removed after being locked down for a year. So as much as I love the focused repetition format and the streak system, this app isn't much more than flash cards with a shiny coat of paint these days. Just keeps getting worse somehow."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Mar2024, dev just released new version and everything is a mess. Sound drops so low its barely audible with sound so high on phone. Ads are blasting loud. Dev still thinks candyland is the way to study languages. 30jan2023.single path version, my study has been so much worse. Picked up 2 other apps to study with. New version is super difficult to efficiently review lessons. Studying languages isnt a game and u destroyed what made your app great. CHANGE IT BACK to 2022. Listen to your users."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very good for a free app, but not without issues: - Ads frequent but expected, though it'd be great to not have volume at 50% louder. - Get asked things not taught-> lost hearts. - Gems get less available as we progress. - App gets wonky. ex. in midst of an XP challenge, switched to language #2 and back, everything got erased! - New records don't get saved. - lost 2x XP due to ""error"". - single syllable words don't get recognized in rec. - Timer doesn't stop during feedback on flagged items."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is an app that at any upgrade you'll get something better every time from the app. Duolingo also makes the learning seem more fun and there are many persuasive things that make you want to come back and continue learning, like the streak, friend quest being promoted to the next league, it even sends reminders a lot. So all in all I think it's a very nice app"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am learning so much with the free version. The lessons have various ways of learning that keep me engaged and I love keeping my streak...it's very motivating. I have tried another similar app, but I must say, this is my favourite! Using the app is handy for anywhere, but using it online skips the ads. I use both. If there were a lifetime subscription I would purchase it! Absolutely recommend this!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duo have excellent gamification, but an outdated approach to language learning, which has cost them. It leans very heavily on grammar translation of mostly irrelevant items with no context (""a car and a newspaper please""). It's weeks or months of constant play before you can say anything relevant to language use. Rethink using a more CLT style approach. Relevant contexts, chunk learning, flexibility with the topics... Contact me and I'd be happy to discuss this."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"the new interface is really limiting and feels counterintuitive to language learning. it's not a linear process and the new structure is painful to use edited to add, I still feel this way, and with the new structure it's even harder, especially in the writing/learn hanzi part. the second character it has you learn Âíñ has so many strokes"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"While I enjoyed the first year with Duo and the Japanese course, it's been a real torture recently. The content of the later courses (section 3) doesn't make much sense, there are no explanations on the complicated grammar structurs, comments have been disabled, no fixing of reported errors - and the usability is terrible. Please invest into a solid app / back-end and learning content instead of adding just more eye candy. There is no fun in using Duo right now, just frustration."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoy learning on this app, and being able to compete on the leaderboard is a fun addition. However, lately, my app has been a bit weird. When I complete a lesson, I am never able to move on from the ""Lesson complete"" screen unless I end the session (my lesson progress is however updated). I'm unable to load the leaderboard, as well as my daily quests. On my profile it also does not show my league (it's supposed to be Diamond) or my Top 3 finishes (I've had a few). Help??"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Pros: gamified element+ repetition makes it easier to learn a lot of vocab words. Cons: everything else. After a certain point I had to go to another app to learn actual grammar because Duo doesn't break the gaming to explain anything & assumes you'll just figure it out. Early on you can, further in no. But I had enough sunk cost by then to succeed beyond Duo. Also I'm good with freemium either giving me ads or hounding me to upgrade, but they do BOTH exhaustively and it gets REALLY OLD FAST."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Getting rid of many of their professional translators and transitioning to AI translation means I no longer trust Duolingo. Machine translation is a joke; it's been proven to be unreliable countless times. I no longer trust Duolingo to accurately teach me my target language. Also, I've noticed many bugs, the constant ads are annoying, and while they advertise rarer languages in reality it's pretty sparse if you're not learning something like French or English."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I want to love this app. But keeping up with the lessons every day did not make me more conversational. I love the formula for the lessons, the intro to vocabulary, the repetition, hear and repeat, and forming sentences based on the lesson, but I'm not learning anything that will help me become fluent. The foundation for learning and retaining a new language is there, I just wish I was actually learning something I could speak and use in real life."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Can be annoying with what it marks in/correct. Spanish is latin American (doesn't specify.) The English is American. Load of what I've been learning is wrong, it doesn't make this clear. There's (seemingly) intentional glitches when closing the adverts but I begrudge upgrading to the paid version til it improves. Especially as it never tells you how much it will cost. The volume of the voices vary a lot. The slow options are painful to listen to"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Lapses into American English can be confusing and annoying if UK English is not recognised. Recently the app has frozen, refused to open from the icon, and has to be opened from the Playstore. Needs to be more stable and robust. App is becoming even more unstable and not opening from the icon frequently. The latest version still has to be opened from Playstore on several occasions. Now will not open at all and shows only an empty screen. Gets worse all the time. Rubbish app. Still useless"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo used to be a decent, fun way to start learning new phrases and words in a foreign language. However they have recently laid off many employees to switch to AI and machine translation, which often contains many errors and will teach learners incorrect grammar and vocabulary. I cannot in good conscience recommend Duolingo at this time."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"While I'll confess the app helped me in my quest to learn Japanese, I'm greatly disappointed by how it all ended. I completed my Japanese course yesterday and I didn't get anything to indicate the completion of the course. No congratulatory message, no badge, no email, nothing! It's really frustrating to think that an app that celebrates far inferior achievements would totally disregard two years of daily learning commitments and a final course completion. I'm disappointed in Duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Wish I could practice speaking Japanese. Also, I run into issues with the ""Continue"" pop up blocking me from being able to select the precious bubble after the previous level was completed. It just tries to get me to continue no mater where on that previous bubble I click. Very frustrating when trying to complete legendary before the next level."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good App, but plenty adverts unless you pay for upgrade, and occasionally hangs/ crashes on my s20. Edit: 100 days in, and generally happy but the app remains a bit glitchy, occasionally doesn't start up/ load correctly. Edit: 180 days in it started being a crashy mess again. Keep having to ""Force Stop"" to get it to load properly. Also, the Americanisms are getting a tad irritating. Wish they did a UK English version!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Useful app to start learning the basics of a language. I like the fact that there are listening, reading, writing, and speaking exercises. There are multiple units for different life contexts. The ads in the free version aren't very annoying, and every once in a while I get awarded Super Duolingo for free for a few days."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I do like this app, and it does tech you the words and the meanings, but I do feel like they need to add more where you can learn how to pronounce and speak the language more than just being able to understand it and hear it. Like I know more words but I find it hard to remember when it gives me more just listening and clicking the meaning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"There are a lot features I am missing compared to normal. I am completely unable to do speaking lessons on the Android app, my course never updates. I have troubleshooted and even reported the issues and gotten nowhere, not only that but I have even seen the official YouTube channel joke about their buggy app and seemingly do nothing. I've been learning Spanish for a year and a half and had Super Duolingo for a year but it feels like they haven't updated or fixed anything in all that time."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why did they have to make ""improvements""? Everytime they do something breaks. The developers stopped responding to help requests a couple of years ago. Now about a quarter of the chests are empty. Rewards for completing friends quests are half (100 gems instead of 200) if you're a free user. This app has become nothing more than a money grab since the company went public."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Overall it's OK, but is somewhat let down by some poor translation, and by comments being turned off. Not only that but it's insistently biased toward American English to the extent that some perfectly fine English phrases aren't allowed. Edit: Still a real shame comments have been completely removed. It's an excellent means of understanding grammar. They're also very slow at fixing bugs! There's two French spoken phrases that it won't accept even a native French speaker, despite many complaints"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app. It was way better before they changed the path. one of the last few updates changed more things and the one thing that bothers me the most is the 2 different voices for the same sentence when choosing from the word bank. Instead of the entire question being set in either the female or the male voice, they set it up where each word in the bank has an assigned voice. So while picking words to make the sentence it could be like 'M-M-F-M-F-F-F'. It's annoying and it throws me off."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Just used the app for the first time in a couple of years, and it has gone downhill. Has become a typical annoying app begging for money and forcing you to watch ads. The pronunciations audio clips are inconsistent and are not great for teaching how words sound. Used to be much better and I could easily knock out an hour of learning. Now I think I will delete my account"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Was good at first. Started to learn Japanese, and it was nice. However, the further i pushed in the pushier, the app got about upgrading. They also lock some important learning tools behind the upgrade. It's getting close to impossible now without upgrading and strongly considering moving to babel. At least they're up-front."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pretty good, thumbs up, silver star. I did learn a fair bit of Japanese here and learning the characters here is great. Dark mode. My settings doesn't have a dark/light mode to default to so anything will just default to light. Every time I switch the dark mode on it goes back to system default which for me, doesn't exist. So whenever I practice Japanese in the middle of the night I become blinded."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The English translations are just odd and don't make a lot of sense. The rewards also disappear when you move them into the shop. I'm still quite fond of the old design, it was way more user friendly, now everything's confusing. Still a good tool to practice you languages, but not a learning tool whatsoever."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app degrades with every update (functionality / navigation) while simultaneously pressuring you towards the paid version constantly. They have also noticably reduced the amount of gems (in game rewards) for the free version as another means of pressuring you into the paid version. They've degraded the learning experience by slowing the frequency of new vocabulary in comparison to how the app was just a year ago, with no explanation of grammar aside from a hidden menu elsewhere."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I really enjoy that the repetition helps the lessons sink in and that you can change the words to only be in the writing style of the language you're learning. I wish there were more lessons on the sentence structure and logic behind it.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Learning japanese, and while it is fairly efficient, i have my critiques about it. 1. I am an extremely fast learner, and the fact you need to complete basically the same lesson around 9 times before moving on is annoying. I master the words in 2 lessons and cannot move on to the next lesson. 2. It disallows creativity in translations and most forced sentences sound unnatural. (""On weekends, i swim"" instead of ""i swim on weekends"")"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Really good no ads and VERY fun I know this is sometimes a meme but really good üòä so yeah really good and at the beginning there is a type of quiz but...THER IS NO WRONG ANSWER! There is also a music learning and math learning but I can't tell you that much because it doesn't work on Android Anyways back to learning languages you might say it's gonna be quick.. BUT ITS NOT it will take well depends what language I'm learning french pand I'm finishing learning it in about 42 days I mean longer
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Sadly I have not enjoyed the latest updates that have been rolled out. Specifically, I am finding the themed units (like ""tell spooky stories"" etc) to be repetitive and less useful than the seemingly more grammar-driven track I was on before. Since the update I also keep getting introduced to vocab I already know as if it's new! And the ""weak words"" personalized practice keeps giving me the exact same six words, which is super annoying and boring. Idk what happened but it used to be much better!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a really good way to step into another language. I like the pronunciation practice element as it helps to build your confidence in this new language. The app does have errors in my case in Mandarin a question may contain the correct Hanzi character but the wrong pinyin while the audio says the hanzi. If you know the hanzi you can complete the task without getting it wrong but especially in a timed challenge it can be annoying. That being said it is a good language learning app.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I would give this app a good rating, were it not for the HORRIBLE speech recognition that ruins the speech part of the learning process. I can repeat words back, even simple ones, precisely as the app is speaking them to me, but at least 30% of the time it will tell me I'm wrong. Another 30% of the time it doesn't even give me a chance to speak before it tells me I'm wrong. Speech is kind of an important part of learning a language so until this is fixed - 2 stars. Imo that's generous."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love love LOVE this app. Currently learning Esperanto and Klingon. I just wish so so bad there was some grammar related units or some word order bits. I'm not quite sure how to order words and it makes it difficult to know if I'm correct when I speak the languages without Duolingo. Other than that I've no complaints! Love love LOVE this app and can't recommend it enough. Love the language selection (including fictional languages like Klingon) and endangered languages!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Loving every course I've started and I'm confident if I actually stick with it I'll be multilingual in no time! I have two different accounts on the same family plan between my old apple device and this android. Around seven courses each, going back and forth between devices makes the number of courses I've taken on seem more manageable. BTW, the new music theory course is FANTASTIC and the new math course is perfect for young kids and adults who want to regain lost skills and/or brain train."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The web interface and Android app should match, but they always show different quests. The Android app often freezes when opened the first time on a day, and has to be closed and reopened. The Spanish course should allow you to try lessons from different groups within a unit in whatever order you choose, but instead it forces you to go in a specific order."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is a really good app to learn languages, but the problem I find is after accidently setting up an avatar, I am unable to remove it or put any photo from my galary in its place... PLEASE, It would be highly appreciated if you provide an option to change or remove the avatar. It is not only me who find this as a problem though, so please Duolingo, respond to our needs."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a great app if you want to learn another language. it is a long term thing so it might not be the best choice if you want to learn an entire language quickly, but then again learning a new language takes time in any format. I personally find the game like mechanics a lovely and engaging factor which really helps me. Overall Duolingo is a fun and educative app that I recommend to all people looking to learn."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"As I use ""my answers should be accepted"" option , there is no response from duolingo for that . When I cleared quests sometimes due to network issue or anything but the counting of quest achievement is not recorded. Also try to make the quests simple and make learning happy I know that's your aim point I appreciate it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"There are ads if ur not a premium and the constant race board is also really annoying because I'm just trying to learning sweadish in peace and at my own pace but with the leader board you feel rushed and like you have to constantly do lessons to keep up for getting demoted. But over all I really like duolingo, its helped so much."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Updated review: There needs to be a confirmation box for timer boosts. When doing a timed exercise, I keep buying timer boosts my mistake because it's right in the spot where I'm typing. I'd like to cancel, but there's no option. It's causing me to lose blue gems. I don't like that. Great app. We need Wolof. I do wish there was a way to send messages to followers and more that we could use the blue jewels on. üëçüèªüëçüèºüëçüèΩüëçüèæ"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It keeps improving over time. I like that the variety in lessons has increased as well. My only issue is that some of the characters have poor Japanese pronunciation that can lead to confusion. I already have a foundation in the language, but this could potentially make it much more difficult for a newcomer."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Update: 2 months, still not earning points for completing lessons. The latest update has made the app even glitchier than before. I haven't earned points/gems for completed lessons since the update (aside from when watching ads or opening treasure chests). Aside from the hopefully temporary glitch, I love this app. Updated about a week later: I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, still not getting points/gems for completing lessons."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I had to restart my Japanese coarse beacuse an update droped me in a spot far beyond my level. It also have this annoying design on learning katakana and hiragana where the further you progress, the longer each step gets, to the point they are twice as long as the normal class. And the speed classes reach points where there are so many words it's impossible to succeed without buying extra time."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,it's so amazing to have the ability to learn new languages as if taking actual courses as you would in college or other manners in which you must pay. i love this app. I've began taking a second language & will continue with another. also getting family involved to surprise with trip to a place we can use our languages learned. so excited. thanks Duolingo

Very fun, but after a month while also doing other spanish learning tasks it is very annoying to train the same words again and again. To jump forward one has to take a test. A typo is enough to throw me back. Even after paying I can not choose my own pace. There is also a lot of typing after a while, which I do not enj√∏y. I don't have the intention to write texts after all. It would be nice to be able to personalize the app a bit."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love Duolingo. I defended it all the time when people said it was a bad way to learn languages. I said that it's not meant to achieve fluency, it's for getting a solid base in grammar and beyond that is great for learning and reviewing vocab. But removing sentence discussions and forums was bad enough. The AI TTS voices are buggy, and don't always say things right. And now it's come out that Duo has laid off human workers in favor of using AI translations?? I can't support you anymore."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Having a huge problem doing the same lessons over and over, the problems just started I have been going strong for almost a year without any kind of problem. I am not able to progress after completing a lesson, it acts as if i didnt. I know practice makes perfect but can someone please fix it, thank you."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The volume of the ads is jarringly louder than the actual lessons, which seems like a ploy to annoy one into buying the monetized version. If they would just turn the noise down this would be the perfect app for learning languages in a linguistically sound yet entertaining way. Highly recommended, just be ready to hit your mute when you finish a lesson. I'm definitely enjoying - and learning - from itüôèüèª‚úùÔ∏èüíñ"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I think it's a great learning tool with multiple ways of picking up or refreshing a language. Two downsides that keep me from giving it a 5-star rating: the speaking feature never works on my phone (may be an Android thing), so I am unable to practice speaking, and I really don't appreciate that all the scenario stories have to be so woke."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm retracting my 5 stars. It's nothing about the app, but the widget. Ever since I updated duolingo, the widget has been running crazy. It always shows me the lighted streaks on the days that I haven't Done a lesson, while also showing me that I haven't done a lesson in some days I've done so.. This has cost me a lot of streaks, and have made me contemplate on removing the widget, pls fix it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Not a bad app considering it's free (with limits unless subscribed). I already know some Korean but trying to get to a place where I can have a full on conversation. Only issues are, sometimes the voices that say the words to you are not pronounced clearly. So when you go to repeat it it fails sometimes. Not a big deal."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. It is helping me so much perfect my Spanish, and I can hop around to other languages. It keeps track of my progress and does reviews if I have been away for a while. It is also fun and motivating to get on every day to compete against others to level up. You can also follow others, be followed, and send and receive support."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They are firing their translators and replacing them with AI, which is already flubbing translations on the app for many languages, especially French, Greek, and Japanese (to my knowledge). It is no longer an app dedicated to bringing accessible language learning to all by amplifying the voices of its native speakers. It has become a soulless corporation shooting itself in the leg by cutting off what made Duolingo successful in the first place. Now, it will lose its loyal, passionate users."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really like Duo, a lot. I've had it for 3 years or so, and when I moved to Quebec I started using it religiously. My two negative comments on the app are: 1) I wish you had a Quebecois course. My fianc√© learned to speak French in Quebec and constantly says how weird/unused the Duo sentences sound. 2) The leaderboard function. I liked it at first, now it feels like I'm more worried about getting points than actually learning. I wish we could opt out for a week or so without losing our ranking."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I honestly adore the app it's fun creative And makes learning enjoyable. I love the way they keep pushing you to do your best in this game showing you leagues badges to kake you more eager! Although I have one problem it might be some technical problems in duoling Out of no where there is some glitches sometimes when you want to change your avatar it doesn't give you the option so if you can please work on that I would appreciate itüòÅ Overall Amazing ü§©
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Hey everyone, I just wanted to share my experience with Duolingo. Unfortunately I was charged with 56‚Ç¨ on accident , I had a really frustrating time using their app. Not only did I encounter technical issues, but their customer support was unhelpful and didn't provide any solutions. It's disappointing when a language learning platform that promises so much falls short in delivering a quality experience. I hope they can improve their services in the future or atleast offer a different plan."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I am learning Japanese and have found Duolingo extremely helpful for around half a year, however after logging on today I did one of the lessons at the level I was at and after I had finished it all of my progress had reset and I was only one unit 1 again. I'm not sure why this has happened but the app has done this before."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I use this app all the time. I have almost a 365 day streak. It's very user friendly and it's incredibly well designed. However I will not be using it anymore because of the sheer number of translators duolingo recently fired and replaced with AI. The existing translators aren't even doing the translations, they are just reviewing the AI translations. I will not support a business that does not have humans at the center of such a human-centric area of learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app for learning languages however it does need those certain basics you find in languages courses or subjects. For example: explaining why this sentence ""Der zug hat f√ºnf minuten versp√§tung"" doesn't have the determiner 'eine' but sentences like ""Es gibt einen f√ºnf minuten versp√§tung"". Very small things like that really do get tricky as beginners like myself will add random prepositions and determiners when not actually needed. Other than thst Duolingo is a great app"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Removing the user comments was a huge mistake. They provided explanations and examples to correct mistakes. The app no longer does that leaving you with no meaningful way to understand your mistakes or improve. There is now no feedback to help you improve. Every update and change seems to make Duolingo worse. Duolingo was much better a few years ago.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall, I thoroughly enjoy using Duolingo to learn except one thing. As a Free User, I do not like when I ""Earn a Free Super Duo"" I don't like the interphase. If I had the ability to turn it off completely. I like the practices for Accuracy Repetition and Speed. If Y'all's could pop a Switch in the Profile options (or summut) I would most certainly rate your Lovely application *****. Sincerely. Ryan McKeag."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I would like to see some rules we can study not only exercises because sometimes without a rule we cannot understand when to use a phrase form or when not to use it. But overall it is great. There is a great deal of repetition on old things and not enough on new things. After 3 months most of the exercises are still about very basic words and nearly none about newly acquired subject
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I think it is the perfect app to learn a language it challenges you so you keep on doing and also motivates you by giving gifts and rewards it is really worth downloading and because of repeating exercises you are unable to forget the words it also creates a good pronounciation unlike many apps with this app I am able to effortlessly learn French and i think soon I can learn another language too.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Easy to use, and easy to fit into a busy life - you can do as much or as little as you want - and I'm slowly making progress in a new language. It can be a bit temperamental on speaking exercises. I'm also using it for a language I'd started learning previously, and I'm finding it not as useful for that as I'm not really learning anything new yet. I love the French podcast that is available too."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"While I really enjoy using the app, I wish it would focus more on basics (numbers, colors, days, months, everyday items) before it launches you into full sentences and phrases. The levels progress too quickly to learn a new language. This is more beneficial for brushing up on a panguage you are already familiar with."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's appalling and frustrating using this app since the previous two updates. I can now log in to the app but I'm stuck doing a story lesson without progressing. When I do my lesson using the browser widget, it doesn't update my progress on the app. So I'm at different stages in the app and in the chrome browser widget. I I've lost my friend quests and I can't meet up my daily learning goals. It's no longer a habit learning on Duolingo, but a chore - one I don't look forward to anymore."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've been using Duolingo for years now and it's great for learning languages casually. I have a 2 year Japanese streak and I feel that it has really prepped me for my trip to Japan. Recently they added a feature where you can scroll through and review all of the words you've learned which is great.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have been using for personal use for years and find the lessons and challenges engaging if you are a motivated learner. I am now using to assist with a homeschool education for my kids and find all Duolingo apps extremely useful, fun, and educational. I am also aware that the public school system in our area is also using to assist with student learning so they must have also found value in it. Would personally recommend to anyone especially to help keep young learners engaged."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"You have to appreciate the beginner lessons and the chance to tap into a foreign language for free or very little money. Once you progress through the levels unfortunately the number of bugs and app errors is very big. Obviously not enough app testing, Duolingo crew !!! (+1 year daily user)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They removed some really useful features, like the sentence discussions where you could ask questions if you were unsure of why a sentence was structured in a specific way. In some case removing years of good advice to help you actually learn the language. And now they've implemented AI into the app. Language learning is way too complex for an AI to handle. Languages are constantly changing, and there's so much cultural context that a machine wont get the way native speakers will"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,teaches by example. uses excellent memorization techniques. I think it is a superb app for learning a language if used alongside other exposure to/learning about the language. it's really helpful when learning things that might not be obvious to those who learn by exposure alone.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I used duolingo for German casually for an overseas trip and it was a puzzle piece fit. Recently started using it again for Japanese on a whim from watching subtitled shows and I've forgotten how fun it is as a game; 11/10 would recommend, very fun for those who are gamer-minded and enjoy learning. I only wish I had stuck with it the first time around but I'm looking forward to picking up where I left off."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Duolingo off and on for about 5 years. I admit that I had a hard time staying committed because I would get stuck on a particularly difficult lesson and rage quit out of frustration. Recently I heard that they had implemented artificial intelligence so I decided to give it another go. I am extremely impressed with Super Duolingo! The frustrating redundancies have basically been eliminated and I'm consistently challenged. If you have tried Duolingo before, no, you haven't!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I had an 1800+ day streak learning Japanese but uninstalled today. The last straw was finding out about Duo's use of generative AI content, but honestly the lessons and especially feedback when you get something wrong have been declining in quality for quite some time. Meanwhile, ads have become more intrusive (especially for Super Duolingo). Also (and this is of course a matter of taste), the reminders just aren't as charming as they think they are. They're annoying."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"For the most part Duolingo is great for learning a new language, I really enjoy the App and the learning. I would definitely recommend. The one little issue I have is that every so often the full translation sentence does not appear, you get to put in one word and that is it so you make mistake and don't record a perfect score."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've used this app since 2018 which makes me feel old. It's incredible though and I'm currently studying Esperanto which is a constructed language that was meant to be used for diplomats, and as a secondary language to help in international communication. If you have a basic understanding of the European romance languages I'd most definitely look into it as it is a mesh of several."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The beyond stupid sentences that you would never use unless extremely high or equally drunk. I found Busuu that uses sentences that you'd actually use & have people of that language speaking it. And also get help with your mistakes by people that know the language. Once July comes around I'm buying a membership to Busuu & not going to touch this app again. Also the running out of hearts gets beyond frustrating when you're almost done but lose the progress because no more hearts
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Life long dream of learning Japanese, might actually come true at last. I really wish there was a way to turn off the streak, I don't care about the godamn streak or who's scaling what mountains. In addition, I want to be able to custom modify the kinda lessons I go through. I want to focus on sentence construction, and words, but I have to keep going through the alphabets, it's so frustrating."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it's a great app many positives but sometimes certain things aren't explained throughly after some practices, I feel it can be a bit fast with learning new words and not repetitive enough with them. I lost a 59 day streak because I got a bit overwhelmed not being able to keep up with new words. Other than that, it's a fun app. They have fun friendly competitions and little fun rewards, and you can meet people."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Update 02/07/23 Terrible delays, over 1 minute waiting before the exercise AND after. As I see it, Duolingo consists of two parts: language learning and challenges. For learning you don't need anything: no diamonds, time boosts, nothing. All paid features do not help learning any better or easier but they help with challenges and points. But while learning part is pretty good, the other part with challenges, earning xp points etc is very bad. So, ignore paid features and your ranking."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"this is the worst mobile learning app I've ever used, it gives you five lives and it expects you to keep a daily streak even when you use up all your lives! and there is an ad after EVERY SINGLE LEVEL, Which doesn't sound to bad but the levels are incredibly short. not to mention the worst part, every time when I type the answer it puts it as wrong! the website is a million times better than this garbage."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Unfortunately, the point count is now broken. I have to always check the score to make sure it is updated. And then restart the app if it does not update. After the restart, it usually catches up, but you lose the bonus time. Today, it just stopped updating the points even with all the restarts. There was an app update available, but that didn't help with the count."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"""Duolingo crowned as ‚Äúundisputed champion of tracking‚Äù"" (article title, not just a tagline) Besides the inappropriate amount of data tracking, the app has heavily begun to rely on AI instead of ppl to cut corners and its not o,nly inefficient, it causes inaccuracy to learning. Don't give this app your data if you can avoid it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is really amazing. You could learn any language! And the best part is after you complete the 2nd unit you get 3 days free ‚ú® SUPER DOULINGO‚ú®. Super Doulingo is amazing. First of all, you get UNLIMITED HEARTS!! And there is also something like LIGHTNING ROUND where you have a timer of 1-2 mins and you'll have to complete the challenge in the timer. It's freaking amazing (like fr!). I would recommend to just use the app and take a look at its ‚ú® AMAZINGNESS‚ú®. I learned alot in this app üíó"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Every language course is of drastically different depth and quality. The app works correctly but the content is very uneven. The loss of both the old course notes and the forums has been a major step backward. Far too often, answers are marked incorrect not because of problems with mastering the foreign language but because of poorly written questions or differences in standard English around the world. And the automated voices often teach very distorted pronunciation."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is fine for vocab and basic sentences when you are first getting started learning a new language. However, the ""gamifacation"" of the lessons gets old after a while and you really need to supplement Duolingo with some other language material as your primary learning source and only use Duolingo as a secondary, easy, at-hand, refresher."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a good vocabulary trainer, although it doesn't teach a lot of grammar and leaves you rather lost if you don't use supplementary material. However, I disagree with their decision to lay off linguist contractors in favor of AI, and so my rating is one star. Books at the library will do a better job of teaching real grammar, anyhow, and nothing beats speaking to someone who's native language is that which you're learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Huge cash grab. You cannot learn correctly and efficiently unless you pay for the super duolingo subscription. Plus the hilariously repetitive ads make me want to shoot my phone. Also they're very clearly using AI as a crutch, but its not as smart as it ""thinks"" it is. The app will keep getting you to practice your ""weakest words"" when in reality they are simple words I've understood and haven't made an error on at all."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm enjoying learning Latin through Duolingo. My only gripe is that the sound quality of the Latin clips is poor sometimes, and other times, the audio is missing. I think it's because Latin isn't a popular language on the platform. Nonetheless, I haven't been hindered by any of these points in my progression."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,overall a good app and good concept to try and make learning feel like a game. it's especially helpful to someone who would like to learn a new language but doesn't stay focused as easy. Good ways to review things you don't quite remember and lots of help as you go make it a very ideal language app. Overall I don't know how much better it can be besides maybe a few gripes some may have that are small its a very nice app for learning new languages
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Fun to use and effective. Pleasent visuals as well. However I don't appreciate having to pay a whole year in advance instead of paying monthly. Also I dislike how I am forced to compete with people, or at least keep being reminded that it is a thing. Making your account ""private"" disables it, but friends/followers also go away. So it's either compete or be alone. Great message, guys. It should be possible to use this app without pressure, with my friends."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's great, but the xp system is a farce once you realise it's not only their to temp competitiveness but is made easy mode by going premium. The ads were manageable at first but now every single lesson has a noisy ad after it, I just do one lesson then close the app on the ad. Getting really tired of it, was going to go super but feel I'm being coerced in to it so might look at other language learning options instead. Some lessons intentionally try to trip you up to cost hearts and dishearten"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I appreciate the program is free but oddly when using the super trial for a few days, the lessons seem much easier to pass. after the trial it gives me words I've never seen before and I'll fail the lesson. Coincidence? 200 days in a row with Spanish. I can remember a few words, I recognize words spoken and sub titled when watching tv shows, but I can't string a sentence with a real person. I feel it's teaching me spelling, but not how to speak. Maybe it's me, I'll keep trying."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is an excellent, actually pretty amazing tool to learn a new language. Even old, not commonly used languages, are at our disposal now. It's designed to encourage you to keep learning, it celebrates every little accomplishment and even sends you reminders when you've stopped taking classes for a while. And you can be anywhere in the world, you just need your phone! Even with fifteen minutes a day you can make progress. That's very amazing to me."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love this app, the little characters are adorable, the artwork is adorable and things are simple to learn, it may take a little while to get used to a new lesson but practice makes perfect. Only thing I wish is if in each lesson there were more varieties and a little more advanced sections to get to to expand the conversation of topics you are currently in. Maybe it will get more like that with similar sections like travel. Otherwise it's motivational and great to learn."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It was the greatest app to learn, but about a month ago it started to buggy awfully. About to look for a new learning app. After last update it got even worse: no listening (click on the speaker but it doesn't work at all), and now I can see no pictures when it shows new words. Now it deserves only one star"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duloingo is great for learning basics, but it doesn't teach grammar (I speak English and am learning Vietnamese) which makes sentence structure a lot of guess work until you figure it out. Free Duolingo also has an aggressive amount of advertisement, with most ads followed by a prompt to buy the premium version, which is subscription based. They really copied YouTube's method of annoying people into buying premium. It's a great resource, but it certainly has its drawbacks."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is very useful. You can learn any language through it. It is friendly and gives you another chance to correct your mistake. It has many leagues where you can compete with others in the game of learning. It gives us the interest to learn more than usual because it teaches us very friendly and playfully. Very much thanks to Duolingo to make this app.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"That new achievement was never available on all phones, the updates I done on the app have not really done anything, there was supposed to be updates on the badge system and nothing, when I do missions there's times it doesn't even count and have to do it again. Lots of users are going up the ranks in the tournament in a matter of seconds. I send multiple emails on this to Duolingo and feels like I'm just getting ignored. I got super Duoligo and feels like a big waste of money and time. üëéüèª"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have enjoyed Duo and it has helped me improve my language skills. However, the app, for whatever reason has some bugs that take away earned gems or hearts unnecessarily. I have found this frustrating on many occasions. App also freezes in the middle of a lesson."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have tried many different language apps throughout the years, but this is by far my favorite. It's been a great supplement to my language studies, because it's fun and feel more like a game than actual studying. The free version is great on it's own, but it's definitely worth paying for Duolingo Plus if you want to get the most of this app. Highly recommend!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is very nice to begin learning a new language. The only problem i get with this app is they say a name in audio and expect us to write it exactly the same and if you don't, it counts as an error. I learn german and they will say same like Volfgang bergman in the audio and even if you miss a single letter, the whole sentense is wrong. I think it is very unfair because i am suppzed to learn the language, not the names of people."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New edit: sadly, as I'm progressing through lessons, I'm finding a surprising number of bugs that are costing me ""hearts"". No response from CS. Kind of disappointed. Edit: I have to say, in the time since it was introduced Duolingo has made strides to fix the heart system. As everyone else has said, the heart system is not what I'm here for. Seems a cash grab. I'll move to another app now after many years..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love the app, the best if you want to learn a new language. One little gripe though, there are a ridiculous amount of adds. I get you have to fund your app but when it feels like I am being bombarded with adverts telling me to sub to super, I feel It needs to be toned down a bit."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've used DuoLingo off and on for a while, but noticed with the layoffs the quality of Japanese lessons has dropped significantly. I used this app to brush up on vocabulary and keep a level of proficiency when I was no longer studying it and my work didn't include the need. In the last several months, my grammar proficiency has decreased thanks to a slow and steady increase of nonsensical phrases in the target language, or mistranslations. The streak addiction is real though - goodbye 700+."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo has made it fun and easy to start learning a new language! The gamification works for me, I like getting rewards and little praises every time I answer correctly. Some of the words/phrases they start you off with are interesting - I told the app I'm traveling for leisure, but I'm learning how to talk about family. Maybe it'll be more useful than I anticipate, but I would still rather know things like ""where's the bathroom?"" before knowing ""she is a mother"". 10/10 would still recommend"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"hello! honestly this app is absolutely outrageous. I can learn every language and the best thing is that you get to repeat the lessons, correct your mistakes and practice! learning new languages is awesome, every single one is easily taught and understood! so I recommend for you to download it and at least try it! you won't regret it!!! thanks!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They keep adding more lessons but instead of getting more content to study, I find myself going through the exact same exercises time and time again after they do an ""upgrade"". This app is not made to help you study but to keep you interacting with it longer (and spend more money)."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used to like Duolingo, and to be honest, it still has its perks related to super basic, beginner language learning, however I've been noticing more & more, recently, that the sentences have gone downhill. Some of the sentences are really weird that I suppose in a building block manner would theoretically fit together, but they just don't make any sense contextually. An example of this is a sentence I got that translates to: 'Before having the children, Sioned used to eat oranges."" Disappointed"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have really enjoyed using this app and am currently just over a 300 day streak. The only thing I can complain about is that the monthly quest meter doesn't seem to be working properly. I missed January's badge after doing plenty more exercises than it said I did. Now for February, I've been doing 2-3 lessons each day and as of Feb 9, it's showing I've only done 4 quests. I'm not sure what isn't working properly to count my lessons, but I'd appreciate if that could be reviewed and fixed."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The tasks are good, it helps with all aspects in learning the language, and the tips for the entire section are really helpful. The only thing that makes it really hard is the number of hearts, 5 hearts is a little too less, and maybe 15 hearts would be better. I mean, the higher I go, the harder the units get, my 5 hearts finish up really quickly and I can't reach my goals, I think 15 is reasonable so people can reach their goals a bit quicker."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app used to be great, but I've noticed a decline in sentence quality in several languages since the update. The app crashes frequently, often when I'm mid lesson. It's also not uncommon for me to do one of the practices to earn hearts or watch a video to gain a heart, and then end up getting nothing."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It starts great. Pictures to learn the words, builds up sentences etc. The further into it, that goes away, and it just gives you different ways to say things with no reason as to the changes to help you understand. Must admit, I'm lost now, so have lost interest as I know what to say, but no idea of the right way to apply it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Constantly reconfiguring courses inserting and removing lessons, each time setting progress back. I was completing a section of a course that originally had approx 30 lessons, I had completed about 10, then it changed to 24 lessons I think, and I was set back to lesson 4 or so, now it has about 46 lessons and I'm set to lesson 10. All the new content I was learning has moved further ahead in the course and now I'm set back relearning all the things I've already learned which is just a waste time"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,at first I I thought that it will only increase my knowledge about the other languages and that how would I be able learn a language completely from an app but it doesn't only gives importance to vocabulary but also on the accent and grammar. plus it's for free it's very helpful and i have made a great progress. It's amazing and more amazing is that i don't have to pay even a penny for learning such good skills üòú. just go for it üòâ
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Im slowly learning the language as is the intention, but for some reason every now and then the audio gets wierd. Sometimes its fine, others time the questions change between quiet and loud. I can max my volume and barely hear it, then the next question works fine so it blasts my ears. Its not every day but when it happens it messes with me more than it should."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app, I typically have terrible memory when I learn new things- but this app helps me remember new things I struggle to remember. I recommend the app before a trip, it has so many languages and the courses are great!! Plus you get to choose how long the courses each day are, and can do so many courses a day! I've done like 5 courses just today!!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's free and I have already learned some grammar. I had a half assed German class in elementary school and so the first few lessons are a bit boring as I already know them, but now it is getting a bit interesting about two weeks in. I really like that you can even use it in public spaces like on the bus as it works even with tapping input only, great idea."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I wish we added the ability to repeat incorrect tasks within the class session itself. Give the student the possibility of practicing pronunciations as if it were in a dictionary. Very good app and the best I've found so far. I recommend it to everyone.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love duolingo it has really helped me with school work and just learning the languages. Sometimes, it gets annoying when the premium thing comes up. But otherwise, it's amazing. It's very helpful being able to have an account on different devices, in my case, I have it on my phone and on my laptop. Anyway, I really do recommend duolingo. Also if you get it, have fun!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The Navajo language needs a little more work. I'm unable to advance and have been stuck for two weeks now. Several words are not being recognized as correct even though they match the solution exactly. I'm using a Navajo keyboard specifically because there are so many specialized letters in the language. This is frustrating because I want to learn more, but I just have to keep repeating previous lessons. In spite of this, I LOVE the fact that DuoLingo offers Navajo as an option!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The free version is very helpful, but it does have an ad between every lesson, which can get a bit annoying. However, I've been practicing so much that they just gave me 3 days Plus. I didn't even have to put in my card info. You definitely need to put in practice with real speakers, but I've used this app since 2016 and always found it to be engaging and educational."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really like duolingo, however, I'm trying to learn mostly Greek which really lacks many features. Apart from listening exercises there aren't any other available (speaking, writing) as well as no variety of voices, only one woman's voice in all exercises. It would be really helpful if the Duolingo team could look into this and upgrade the learning of Greek language. Then I would also subscribe for the premium version."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really like the app and I feel like I'm learning quite abit of Spanish... what I don't really like is how long I have to wait to get 5 hearts again when not using the paid version, but you can use the practice option to gain hearts which is a great feature. Also, there used to a chat/comment option for each phrase and each lesson. Sometimes it can get confusing and there are sometimes more than one way to translate something. I thought it was useful to talk with other users about it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love the app. You can learn at your own pace. There are goals to achieve at a steady pace to keep you from over saturating the learning. It keeps a record of what you are stuggling with, which makes it more personalised. I also love the leader board, which keeps you motivated to keep going. If you have been putting off learning a lesson, this is a great way to begin that journey! I would give 10 stars if it was available."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"really enjoy it so far! can't think of any improvements it may need. Edit: Aggressive ads to make me buy the premium version? I've bought it, and I will again in just can't afford it right now. So just because of that unethical business tactic I'm giving it two stars. You should rely on the quality of your app, not overly numerous ads to profit. I understand the need for ads of we're not paying for the premium. But at this point with all companies it's a war for attention and it's unethical."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's a perfectly serviceable game, if you like learning AI generated phrases with no sense of real voice or practical value, no human behind the screen teaching you the reason why sentences are structured that way, or the differences between inflections or intonations, or what cultural differences you may find between structures. Memorize AI-generated text and get graded on how well you put together an AI-generated puzzle based on it, with all the actual culture removed from language. Bravo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"A triumph for style over substance. Full of unresolved problems. Can't get a resolution no matter how much you try (Duo could not care less about user experience). Quality of experience has plummeted in last few months (more ads, worse educationally, etc). I use this app a lot and every day it cheats me out of ""rewards"" it says it gives (gems, double XP). Much more effective apps for langauge learning; only good for a bit of occasional fun."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The friend quests are set up poorly. It doesn't take into account that not everyone puts effort into them. I always end up doing all the quests and or close to. I should always be stressed out when on this app. I am losing motivation. My current quest is score 90% on 60 lesson!!! On yop.pg kids and work. 60 lessons is a lot. The friend quests need to be set up that if the one person does at least half ,hey should pass. I don't want to lose out on gems because I didn't do the other friends work."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love Duolingo, it is super nice to learn languages for free in a fun way. I guess i still like the old layout more, which seems less lengthy? But I like how the CEFR level is now shown on the Spanish course. I never take part in the discussion on the sentence pages, I liked how there was such discussion platform. It was fun to read them and sometimes I benefit from it by finding out certain details in learning points that I missed. But I guess it takes up much manpower to manange it?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoy this app. The exercises cover listening, speaking, reading and writing in your chosen study-language. The tasks are short and varied with many different voices used to speak in their 1st language, to help you assimilate the reality of the language. You are encouraged to repeat and correct, the activities that you made mistakes in. The app tracks common errors that you make in both spelling and punctuation of your selected new language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Not perfect but still very helpful. Harder levels should get harder though but doesn't really, at least first levels in German. Still great! EDIT: Changed my rating to 3 stars since the annoying video ad popup. This is an excellent app and this just spoils the whole experience. No I'm not a paying member but if I had the funds I would gladly do so. I'm sorry."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The Avatar should not be the only option for a profile photo. I don't like the look of the avatars, and just prefer having an actual photo. Make it an option for people to choose between one or the other. I've also noticed that the Android version of the app is less responsive then the iOS version. I have a newer phone that works well with most other apps, so I know my phone model is not the issue."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really good app to learn languages. The 'gameification' works well & encourages you to practice often. Very occasionally a vocal exercise is detected as being wrong even though it's being pronounced correctly (I think), so it's not perfect. A lesson will also sometimes hang at the end with the flashing dots although the progress seems to get recorded. Would be good to be able to spread cost of annual family plan. Also be good to be able to save 2x XP pots so you can use them when you want to."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I really enjoy duolingo and have learned so much off of it so thankyou. One thing though and that's that the pace. It has a normal track and if your a slow learner you can review but there isn't any option for learning it faster because sometimes I get bored of having to do the same thing so much.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy using Duolingo on a daily basis as it is easily accessible and easy to get started. I am learning Norwegian in about 15 - 30 minutes a day. There is repetition of words and phrases in various ways so that I am able to eventually remember more and more vocabulary and sentence sentence structure rules in a natural way. There are ways to include competition with yourself and also with Duolingo ""friends"" to encourage one to continue practicing which leads to improvement. I like how easy is"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Notifications are annoying and when I speak into the mic it can't register.Learning French is fun but the new Duolingo the interface has changed and the structuring of lessons is inconvenient.I know you will not change but I hope it comes out how annoying your app is and I would rather do Lingodeer you trash developers.0 stars I am just doing it to learn French
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App is fine for very basic introduction to language learning and getting started, but you will not learn more than the basics. That said, in app monetozation is overly aggressive and getting worse. Also the company recently laid off human translators in favour of AI translation, and that's morally reprehensible. Doubley so when you continue to pay for their services via ads or subscription. Tripley so when there's no guarantee of quality from the AI."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have been using new layout for some time now and I must say it is a serious step back. Endless scrolling between units, not being able to easily choose the subject I want to repeat, not able to easily choose a story I like, really helpful explanations replaced with a guidebook that now shows only key phrases (at least in the Turkish course)... theis list of DOWNgrades goes on and on... And suddenly my legend-status course has like 10 units degraded and requires TONS of diamonds to reinstate"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've used this app for a year, used the free version and loved it! I decided to subscribe and love it more! This is the only app I can say was not a waste of money or time. I honestly can't say or think anything bad about this app! This app rewards those who put in the effort without emptying your pocket. I surpassed 2 years worth of high school Spanish class in a month and that's with learning German at the same time with no prior knowledge. You get out of it what effort you put into it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've come and gone from this app since 2014. The improvements they've made have really made this time stick - 32 day streak! My partner speaks Frenchand it's been really fun slowly introducing more French into our conversations and practicing together. I can see the progress and retention. Bonus that I was able to review everything and turn it into legendary status before continuing where I left off!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"So I've been using Duoling for a month now, I just over to an area with a bigger Spanish speaking population than where I grew up. I work at a hotel, and I had a Spanish speaking man come in with no reservation. We were both nervous and stumbling and then Spanish just fell out of my mouth. One of the first lessons for Spanish is exploring a city and getting around and travel, and the words just came out and really helped. We were both shocked and so happy. You Must put in the work."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was using this app before the update and I'm very pleasantly surprised that after coming back to it, they added a new feature that allows you to regain the hearts you've lost by doing lessons. Now I can focus on the practicing part instead of the mistakes I've made part! Five out of five ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Using the app is great and has the fundamentals to learn but it can be very random in the sentences it throws together that wouldn't realistically be in a conversation. Also I docked it 2 stars as it's full of bots / fake model profile pics on the fish for data. The timed challenges are setup to fail so you have to spend even more money on top of your Super Duolingo payment . So could get quite expensive if your inclined to compete against bots
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app is Great and the mission is great. I and my girlfriend started learning Chinese last week. The problem is that we both get stuck after 4-5 lessons since the app stop starting recording function so we can't take speak lessons after 4-5 lessons. We have two different phones and we have the same problems. I tried to contact via emails but no response. I am really looking forward to the reply from the developer.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"A year ago I would have given this 5 starts, but the quality has really declined recently. The transition to AI writers doesn't seem to be going well. I'm noticing a lot more issues like nonsense sentences or identical prompts that appear two or even three times in the same lesson. It feels like they're cutting corners and it shows."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"reasonable language learning app. I understand that learning a language through an app is difficult and that using Duolingo as your only method of learning is incredibly limiting, but Duolingo offers a high level of accessibility especially for languages which are not commonly spoken near you. There are only a few minor issues with the app, it is unclear when completing a quest at midnight counts (I've had it happen where I completed a badge without reaching the full amount of quests required)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This programme enables me to learn at my own pace. The rate I get through a section depends on my ability to understand the subject matter which is varied. I do not feel under pressure if I am struggling. This style of learning creates an atmosphere which for me is conducive to learning....a first.....This suits my learning style as I am still having daily French lessons one year on....
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm only 3 days in to my lessons, but wow! It's captivating and the way it's set up makes it so easy to remember. You review things a lot, you practice saying, seeing, typing, and hearing the words and phrases which really makes it stick in your brain. I'm really excited about how much fun I'm having with it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love learning Greek with Duolingo!! The app makes learning a new language easy AND fun!! Each lesson feels like a game, and the leaderboard and friend features allow you compete against other users as well as celebrate their milestones, which motivates you to just keep going!! There's the occasional ad, but some are skippable, so it's not a big deal!! (A free app has to make revenue somehow, after all!!) Anyways, I recommend this app to any curious mind who loves language learning!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The best language app I've ever tried but I can't give 5 stars because the speaking exercises don't work. I turned on the microphone and gave all the permissions but it still doesn't help. I really lack pinyin in guidebook section. The characters are not helpful for me to write the phrases and read them to remember better. And one more feature that would make this app perfect is flashcards tool. That would be so much helpful to make the words memorizing and reviewing easier.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I like Duolingo a lot it helps with learning new languages but while making you feel like it's a game. Duolingo finds fun and challenging ways to help you with the language you are trying to learn. It also reviews any mistakes you made throughout the lesson you are on. The only thing I have against is how they word things the way they word things quite challenging to figure out I was stuck on a lesson because they expected me to know that I needed to split up the word. Overall I like Duolingo.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Honestly I'm only on my second day, but with me actually focusing and wanting to learn, with the words I've been given I'm able to remember and say out a sentence, then I constantly repeat what I've been taught that day aswell as continuing to form the simple sentences, I'm on the letters at the moment and its helping to write them down as well a a word that has the sound the letter makes, and its helping a lot, first time trying to learn a new language and with the format this app has, it helps"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"A helpful language-learning tool, but in need of improvements. Search capability would be helpful to review specific categories, rather than following a specific path. They also purposely place buttons to use gems (buy & use timer boost packs, increase 2X periods) in ways that you are very likely to hit accidentally (e.g., timed tasks), which is very frustrating when this is not your intent -- they insert screens everywhere else except when they're trying to take your gems. Unsure if I'll renew."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really like duolingo, especially since they kind of changed how the app operates. The units are more organized and sectioned and out of all the new things they have. The widgets are my favorite part everyday. I only wish they had new pictures for the widgets. I like to strive and see new funny duolingo pictures everyday."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A fun way to learn a new language. Sometimes I find myself being too competitive and move ahead before I have truly grasped the lesson. When that happens I force myself to ignore points or leagues and focus on mastering the level. I enjoy the new ""Words"" list for practice and reminders."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,They have really been screwing up this app. Something changed a few months ago and it started pronouncing words incorrectly.. at least in portugues. So the words ending in r like beber or dormer they started adding an sh sound at the end of the word. It's very annoying and very wrong. I have repeatedly reported it since it started and they have done nothing to fix it. I can't learn a language if they don't pronounce the words correctly.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"There are no options on the app to point out errors. Most of which are only the mispronounciation by the automated voices. Also, some of the story lines are not necessarily appealing to a general audience. Too many repititions become tedious. Some sentences are humourous but so unrealistic as they will never be used in any context. However, the app is a very helpful tool and somewhat addictive. But it is best used with other learning material. Some explanations of grammatical points are missing."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I had downloaded this app after my mock results at school where i was failing french and have already made significant improvements in a month and am now passing french by just using this app alone. This app is perfect to learn from as long you keep with your ""streaks"" for 2-5 minutes per day and the game style is also engaging. Its in depth, offers tips and is enjoyable. I dont have duolingo ""super learner"" but it is not necessary to use app at all."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Been using it for a year now, pretty good app apart from the new update that made all profile pictures have an ""avatar"" instead of a picture. Doesn't let you change back to a picture/image file even if you go on the website instead of the app. I personally don't like this update, I don't want to display how I look, I want to show pictures of my cat etc"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Excellent resource for the self-motivated learner. If you actively wish to learn a new language, you can really make this app work for you if you take it upon yourself to make it a rule that you speak out loud to the best of you ability at every opportunity, as the app is not able to focus on spoken exercises. In leu of this, I really wish there were auditory-only exercises that forced you to listen to a sentence in the foreign language, which you then have to type out the translation of."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Beyond defeated and frustrated. Unless you pass the exercise ALL EFFORT DOESNT COUNT. I'm sorry I've taken a hit with the economy and I can't afford a membership but to kick me in the groin for even trying and I'm sorry, conjugation of verbs is hard in a language not your own when you're learning, only to have it fail you when you try your damndest to practice every day... Congratulations. You've killed my desire to learn. Thank you so very much for that."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app for learning the basics! Just wished that along with showing what word goes in which grammar position of a sentence, it also showed / taught you WHY it went there in that situation, so you understood why that word or word derivative was used instead of just relying upon rote learning. Overall, though, solid 8 / 10!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Today something happened that made me disappointed with Duolingo after many similar incidents. All of a sudden, the lessons changed from unit 5 and became unit 2. God knows what happened to the previous three units, but the important thing is that the possibility of reviewing them was also lost. It used to happen with lessons on the updates before. but now it regress automatically as scale of units!!! I have no motivation to continue with duolingo anymoreüëéüèªi warn this before. Why duolingo ign?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"nice app for learning, but hangs & crashes often in my mobile device due to which I've lost 150 gems so far. also when playing timed challenges clicking on check & continue makes it slow and there is also a really annoying pause after hitting the continue button which results in multiple wasted seconds, making me loose & start from the beginning. Also it lacks some basic day to day conversation like 'how are you?' etc."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the variety of exercises. There are also several ways to review and correct mistakes, along with stories that have a natural flow that immerses you in the languages. I appreciate that the app creators are good about updating and fixing issues in the learning process, which keeps the lessons fresh and challenging. The part that I like most is the ranking system and rewards that motivate me to fight my procrastination."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app while useful is so buggy that it is frustrating. The amount of times you say things correctly and it flags as incorrect is incredible. To a point that during some of the talking exercises I feel like giving up. The leagues are pointless, people shouldn't feel guilty because they haven't managed to find time to use the app on any particular day. This app would be loads better with a ""conversational"" setting, I'm not going to be talking about a butterfly writing a book at any point."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Paid for a year subscription but then my phone died. After installing the app on my new phone I was unable to login to my account. After attempting to reset the password many times I reciece the error that my email/account name is invalid & contacting support online multiple times I've received no assistance with account retrieval. The account recovery messages say a solution is coming but not to expect anything right away, for weeks. I can't recommend paying for an app with no support."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Personally feel like duolingo is a good place to start to learn a language. However I don't feel like its good enough to give you a proper feel for the language or even teach you how native speakers would talk. Duolingo IMO is the best app for vocabulary but the worst for the grammar. If you really want to learn a language your best bet is either find yourself a teacher for that language or spend some time living in a country where they speak said language.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's not adding the XP even after completing many lessons and challenges, today. Spent an hour and completed challenges on 2x XP, But the XPs are just disappearing in thin air. I restarted the app several times. Even worse..after restarting the app, my existing XP has reduced less than half. So frustrating."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Animations for words appearing on the word-match exercises are too slow. They take forever to appear on both columns, all the while the clock dwindles. They should appear instantly, not fade in like a bad Powerpoint. I get ""speedy"" grades on the regular levels but those bonus levels are ""merde"". I'm not playing it again until this is fixed as i don't like leaving levels behind without obtaining all stars. I'll maybe use Babbel instead. Frustrating as i'd sank a couple of weeks into Duo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very flawed. Terrible lag after studying for more than 30 minutes makes it almost unusable. Many times it freezes and does not count points earned. Several times it has marked me as incorrect where I have used a word that means the same thing. Some open ended questions are marked wrong when what I have written is grammatically & factually correct, just not the answer the app was looking for. Overall a good idea, badly implemented. Would give it zero stars if possible. DO NOT PAY FOR THIS."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very good! Much better than past iterations. Unfortunately there's still a few elemental/basic errors with audio/spelling in many languages (thus the 4/5 rating - it's poor practice to teach WRONG pronunciation to students. And this IS surprising! The app's been around for a LONG time - they've had the time, money, and expertise to fix what they haven't), but for free?? Absolutely a smart investment. A fantastic app to help us along with our language studies! Truly remarkable! Thank you!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Thanks to Duolingo I am now able to say that I can communicate in English and I've been learning a lot using the app, installing the app was the best decision I could've ever made . Update: I am not going to lie, the app was better before you guys updated it. Now it sucks, it doesn't give you the opportunity to learn in a fun and easy way anymore. One don't have the flexibility to go from one lesson to another and that's boring and make one less motivated. Update #2 : Please fix the app back!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I think this is a very user friendly app, amazingly almost impossible to advance without your brain. Highly recommend it. There IS a premium subscription if you so desire, but you're fine without it, not pay to advance, and Duolingo without premium I think helps you to think about it and not make mistakes."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great fun and easy to learn. But if you do not subscribe you now get an advertisement of 5 seconds after every lesson which is so distracting and uses up ones data. And the sound is so loud. I need to switch off advertisement sound at the start. Please reconsider shorter advertisements of 3 seconds or less for those of us who cannot afford your subscription.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Fun to play, I guess that's the point. But as a lifelong multilingual person, I'm finding it rather superficial and potentially harmful to my language learning so I'm taking it with a grain of salt... Warning: I downloaded it to help with Spanish (Spain setting), which I've been speaking for years with family in Spain. The vocabulary - verbs and nouns - are frequently different in Duolingo. My family speaks standard castellano and lives in a big city. This is unfortunately useless."

But just today at exactly 12:00 I had finished a lesson and it used one of my freezes. However instead of protecting my streak, it broke my streak, putting me all the way back on day 1. What's the point of the freezes if they don't keep your streak? I'm so ticked off. It didn't even offer to repair the steak via gems or with super duolingo like it had before idk I'm just peeved."

Which help's for also the kid's who cannot speak or cannot try to sound talk. You should make more of this Duolingo game's because, it really help's others focus on there learning! Super Duolingo is helpful 'cause you get add free. Thank you Duolingo developer's! We or I hope we can help the earth with more language's and make it more popular. Stay safe!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It used to be a great app to start learning new lang. It isn't now. If you start learning a new lang you won't find any explanations or rules or native speaker comments. Try a hieroglyphic language. You won't even learn how to read. You'll just memorize how each picture is translated, with absolutely no understanding of how to read it or how to build another word from it. I started learning turkish a year ago and i had great progress. I looked turkish course now and it's a real disaster."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App experience has gone progressively downhill over time. Leaderboard stacking. Paywalls. Invasive ads. Lessons plans that discourage you from learning and trying because mistakes lock you out of the app. It was frustrating, but knowing I was supporting a team of creatives passionate about teaching languages made up for it a little. With the sacking of linguists in favor of AI driven by being greed and profit, I have no reason to support Duolingo anymore. Uninstalling and disgusted."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Too easy. It also put me into a lower level because missed the word the, and miss, and yo, which real speakers don't use. And I am not going to use the app daily when I have other Spanish apps and often no screen time for days. If I have to slog through easy exercise again and again, just because I don't use the app each day, I do not think the app is useful. I need an app that allows me to use it when the screen is off and I am driving or working with my hands or blind. Otherwise 5 stars."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Though a little glitchy at times, it is pretty easy and enjoyable to learn some other languages. Also it is completely free and kind of relaxing and calm when I do it. This app is one of the greater ones on the app store and I can't understand why there are low reviews. But overall great for learning other languages fast and easily!"

Translate this sentence are annoying when 1. you have to tap each word, get them in the wrong order, can't move them. Very annoying when doing timed stuff. 2. The learning language is spoken while translating fom eng is not, making it kind of frustrating when you're slow processing writing... 3. Words repeating for so long... Sometimes being a weird pick of them, like I have no reason to repeat the world lawyer 700 times."

The lessons are fun, engaging, and incredibly effective. I appreciate the variety of languages available and the fact that I can learn at my own pace. The app's gamified approach makes learning feel like a fun challenge rather than a chore. The ability to practice speaking, listening, reading, and writing in the target language really helps to reinforce what I've learned. Plus, the app is"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Its working, and I'm learning, but I can't help but believe there are intentionally hard/curveball questions designed to rob you of your hearts sometimes in an effort to push you into buying the premium subscription. Its over $10 a month for a family plan, which honestly just feels too expensive for what you get. Can't recall the individual price, but if its more than $1 a month it shouldn't be."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a very effective app in learning new and multiple languages. It helped me to learn new words, I will say is 100% good the reason for my 5 star, but I will like to enjoy more of free premium learning. But I will advise especially in German course where one have from A1 - C2 level, if each of the level will be differentiated it will help alot especially to the beginners. So they won't be scared because of the grammatical structures, aside that, is good to go."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's good but I have a few gripes. Gaining a lot of points on Android is hard because lessons are worth less on Android than on iphone hence limiting you from scoring higher on the scoreboard. Lessons introduce a lot of new words each time which makes learning difficult. There is a lot less repetition as lessons go on which is the main thing that helps people remember words properly. Put everything behind a paywall and claim they have to ""run ads to make duo work"". Lol ok. Y'all just need money."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app. I haven't gone very far but it is a great app if you just want to learn the basics of a language. Don't expect to learn a whole language just because of this app but, it definitely helps and they have plenty of languages to pick from. It has helped me with reading and writing a lot but it is going to take a long time to actually be able to speak in full, confident, sentences."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have been working with this app for more than 3 months. There is nobody available to assist. If you have any questions. Nobody available to answer any grammatical errors. No way to talk to anybody about fixing issues with the app. Love learning language but had to work with outside instructors to fix some of the errors. These errors made me lose my streak. I guess that's worth it to have to write a review with such negative language since there is nobody else I can talk to.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Definitely some QOL things that I have qualms about (no more discussion section, the amount of stuff being locked behind Super, etc), but for what it is, you can't really go wrong with Duolingo. It's a super fun way to dip your toes into a new language (or two... or five), especially ones that you wouldn't ever consider otherwise. I am 99.999% sure I'll never need to use Russian, but DAMN if it's not fun to learn from the lovable (and slightly scary) green owl. 178 day streak and counting üéä"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy this app. I never took Spanish in school, growing up in the 90s it wasn't required. However, in the career world, many employers are seeking bilingual staff. Employment advancement is my main motivation for using this app. I'm only on day 3, but so far so good. There are minor ads but nothing overbearing. They do ask you to buy a plan but you can opt out. I might consider purchasing a premium plan. I highly recommend this program. The cartoon people are hilarious!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"After four years, the lessons are too hard. I'm going back and starting over. There's so much I don't understand. The app only let me go back to the beginning of Unit 40, but I need to relearn some things way before that. The changes that were made a year or so ago that were supposed to make the app more personalized are not personal. The things I need help with are never retaught. The old app before the updates had conversations that were very helpful to me. It also let me go back to relearn."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"One star is honestly too much for this. This app has many ads like, whenever I complete a lesson there is an ad, I always have to watch an ad whenever I'm trying to learn. It feels like whenever I use this app I spent more time watching ads than I do learning the language I want to learn which is really demotivating. If this is to promote the premium plan it's not working it makes me want to delete the app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been using DuoLingo for a bunch of years now. I started again during the pandemic, and have been a regular user ever since. I'm sorry to say, but it used to be WAY more entertaining and educational. Most of the features they have which add value become a burden, such as leaderboards you can't opt out of, or ""friends quests"" you have no control over. Plus, the best approach to instruction isn't 1 size fits all, but there's no variety in the approach. i love DuoLingo but so much could change."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duo used to be better. I use it for Japanese. They did away with the helpful comment section. There is no duo community now. I can't even select the sentences I get wrong to copy and paste into other programs to even understand the sentence. The hints dont help, and no comment section to help either. You need to choose an avatar now too. It's free but it just seems like it's getting worse. I even lost an 800+ day streak bc I was unmotivated and chose to learn in other ways. I want off this ride"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This has turned from useful language app into pay-to-learn. If you don't pay, you won't really learn a language. If you do pay, you are supporting a company who removed community features (like discussions for each question) and also replacing translators with ""AI"" (resulting in low quality). By the way, the app is pretty buggy for such a popular app. I got a new, high-end phone with all recent updates, but duolingo still freezes and crashes frequently."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Generally good app for learning, I've been using it for 2+ years. But I have daily frustrations. I'm using Android, Ipad, browser, all 3 are vastly different experiences. Feels like they don't care abt providing a consistent experience. ie: dbl XP gift for Friend Quest challenge & will just disappear on the website. & seems like translations are AI generated, which doesnt work for cultural translations. I'm constantly reporting errors, which feels like I'm doing their job"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo makes it really fun and rewarding to learn a new language. The progression of the course feels very natural and well thought out. I purchased the family plan and while I love not having ads or limits, i feel that the value added is not really worth the $167 I paid for the year."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Aggressive monetization. As an example, there has been a shift in emphasis in exercises to perfection and even some events that have you racing against a clock and necessitating perfect performance in order to max XP earnings for the event - but if you turn in a less than perfect run, you can always just spend the in-app currency to buy more time for that session because well you already sunk in all that time into that exercise, would you? All it taught me is monetization techniques."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm so tired of the app crashing several times per lesson, random restarts, randomly turning off speech exercises because it's taking too long to start recording. It's exhausting to try to get even one lesson done let alone complete all my daily goals and I don't want to give up my learning but I'm so close to giving up on this app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This is a decent app to learn a couple of semesters; however, it is lacking. This app shows you new words that you are tasked to memorize, and then it throws phases/sentences at you to memorize. The problem is that it never gives you what I would call a lesson. It never just tells you what the rules of the language are or the grammar. You have to figure these details out from the sentences you have to memorize. This is okay in the beginning, but it gets to a point where I find it untenable."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Fun way to learn, recommended. It's more challenging in the free version, but you can definitely use this app to practice for a new language you may be learning. Explains basic pronunciation and writing skills, but not much information about grammar. But for using the app for just 2 weeks I can recognize some dialogs in real life and words sound more familiar. Give it a try!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app was excellent up until the recent ""path"" update. In their attempts to gamify the app, it's become slow and tedious taking an incredibly long time to learn any new words at all. No longer really that useful for learning a language compared with the old configuration. I suppose they did this to push people into using the paid version, but the new update is so hopeless I have less interest than ever."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"3/25 Russian audio doesn't work at all 3/23 App still has so many issues. The pronunciation, the unnatural voices, the forces accents, the lack of oversight with answer options considering there's always multiple ways to say stuff in other languages, the lessons that don't make sense, the lessons that don't help teach anything.... Too many issues and 500 characters isn't enough for me to write a review below zero stars. Try your luck with Babbel or Rosetta Stone."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I recently changed my phone into an Android. My experience with Duolingo now is weird because the animation doesn't work even after I checked the settings and the option is enabled. I also noticed the exercises got easier, or is it just me?"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoy using this app in the mornings before work. The gamification makes it a bit easier to stick with versus other methods of learning a new language. My wife and I got the Super Family Plan since we both use the app often on our phones. I think Duolingo is great for daily practice and getting the basics down. That said, I'm not sure if one can become fully fluent on Duolingo alone."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good, but OMG, the amount and LENGTH of ads for non-subscribers make the use of the app super annoying over time. Also, the cost is insane for super duolingo. After going through a few of the units, I would recommend people go use other free apps like Rosetta Stone, which are, albeit less fun, much less annoying than watching a 3 min ad after every lesson."

(original below) Ads are louder than app, so it blasts the ears constantly. Ads. So many ads. Loud, constant ads. Honestly not good enough to subscribe. Inflexible, not agile enough to use a simile or a common substitute word that's effective in usage."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Once again I spent over an hour studying on Duolingo and got no credit for the time spent. I am now going to get either a streak freeze or lose my consecutive days. I've already lost many. Personalized practice is a complete waste of time. I rarely miss a single one and I would rather spend my time learning something I don't already know. I've been boycotting Duolingo.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app to learn a language to a certain point, but there is no explanation whatsoever when it comes to grammar. It's useful for languages, where the grammar is quite similar to a language you already know, or if you already learned it somewhere else (e.g. back in school and want to relearn it). Otherwise you will need an additional professional learning class after you finished the basics."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Super Duolingo is almost needed to get though everything, it's very hard to keep your streak when you keep failing questions and run out of hearts. It's also hard to get into the next leagues, as people with super have a much higher chance and have more xp available. it's very annoying."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo never replied when I repeatedly reported that I never got a chance to speak back when I was using my computadora. They never explained the problema to me. When I use my cell phone I do not have the problema. Also, it would be extremely helpful if you would give us a vocabulary list every few lessons that we can print and study. That would be muy grande. I am enjoying Duolingo. Muchas gracias."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have the free version. there's a lot of ads, some are v short tho. I do enjoy the format, otherwise. with the free trial of premium it is much better with access to more. I didn't like the ratio of gems we can earn vs. how many gems you need to spend to participate in certain things. it's lopsided. Hearts (lives) take very long to regenerate as well. I wish there was a part that allowed us to speak and be rated on our accent & to help us recall in real time to get used to actually conversing."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Was progressing really well until I got to the section learning numbers, specifically any speaking exercises. It just won't recognize the words for any numbers, but recognizes all other words in a phrase, causing me to get many attempts ""wrong"". Doubt I'll be renewing my subscription if this isn't fixed."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I really like the App. Learning with Duolingo feels like playing a game and that makes it easy to learn a new language. It's also fun to compete with each other. It's just kinda annoying that you always have to watch ads after every lesson if you can't afford super Duolingo. And I would wish for some more variety in the tasks. And you can't learn every language. I wanted to learn Japanese and Nepali and you can't learn Nepali on Duolingo. That's kinda saf but all in all the app is great.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really like the learnening style that it presents, and when im not following a specific lesson there are individual practices for listening and speaking. For example i thought my speaking needed help, so i would just do individual speaking lessons until i felt i could hear and repeat better. Then I realized I wasn't comprehending what I was hearing, so i concentrated on listening lessons. However, I feel that sometimes it is too push with its reminders and streaks."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo (In the German course) is great. My only problem I with it is the fact that Bea (One of the characters) talks way to fast. I can understand all of the other characters perfectly fine except Bea. I have repeat her sentences far more than I do anyone else. Another problem I have is some of the dumb sentences you have to translate. I get adding funny sentences to make learning enjoyable but most of the ""funny"" sentences aren't funny. The sentences need an update."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,it's an amazing way to learn a new language. they don't limit your learning ability because you don't have premium or something but still help you grow. the ads aren't even that bad and come up when you're done with a lesson. also the recoding exercises help so you have pronunciation right and to make sure you can correctly and confidently say it out loud. when you have to type it they don't mark you wrong for a spelling error but rather if you're missing a letter. overall great app Love you duo
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Amazing!! I've learnt so much and Duolingo makes me motivated to keep going. Would definitely recommend it and wether you're using it for school or work or just for fun it is a fantastic online teacher. My friend had it and recommended it and it has changed my life. I am doing a language to help communicate with family and thanks to this app I can finally understand them. I hope you get this app and enjoy learning the language of your choice. Bye
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm learning Japanese. However, ""Practice your words"" doesn't work and neither do ""speaking exercises"". What's the point of paying when features don't work. üòë They don't even work on the PC. It's nice for encouragement and practice. But not learning in a proper way. Like it doesn't state which its formal or not to say something. I want to like it because of the easy interface, but it's ok for in-between lessons."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Fun lessons and very encouraging. As a native 'British' English speaker I have to filter translations through my understanding of 'American' English though (ON the weekend instead of AT the weekend, for instance) or get marked as wrong.

Responses are always the same with asking for more details, screenshots so far have not worked, but my description of the issue has been given. I think more help, because, I have been unable to continue playing because of the issues reported. I need real help, not computer generated responses."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I prefer the old lay out where you could pick the subjects you would learn about. The app is now structured like game levels. But the premium is worth it if you want to learn for longer in the day so you don't have to worry about running out of lives. It's worth supplementing your learning on the app with other language speakers on tiktok
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"When English is the native language used by the learner, the exercises are fairly good and very imaginative at times, but if I do the same course using Spanish as the native language, often times the translations provided are irrational and grammatically incorrect. Also feedback is often not working for such examples hence I'm leaving my feedback here."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. only a couple of suggestions. First thing, it reminds me to watch the accents, I can not do accents on my phone keyboard. I still get credit, would like to know how to correct. Second thing, I would like to understand why some words require an ""A"" at the beginning of a sentence, and by changing one word, the ""A"" is not needed. I would love an option to speak the word and told if I am pronouncing it correctly. Would love to see a list of the words I have learned for review. TY."

And it keeps telling me I've got spelling mistakes when it is all about the accents! I really don't get this"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The repetitive lessons helps one to remember past lessons and to build up vocabulary. I also love the fact that meanings of words are revealed and sometimes pronounced when the words are touched. makes for faster understanding without having to look for a dictionary. please provide more hints on grammatical guidance eg. why should ""petit"" be placed before ""restaurant"" but ""Francais"" is placed after ""restaurant"", in a french statement, when describing a small restaurant and a french restaurant"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible calculation of streaks, doesn't recognise me completing lessons as streaks for no absolutely no reason. It also resets my progress, I was left with Lesson 6 of Japenese Section 2 Explorer Unit 4 yesterday, but today they have reset my progress to Lesson 1 of the same Unit. It is very unfair because it diminishes my progress and frustrating because I have to do it all over again for absolutely no reason apart from the app's issue"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo has a stock ticker so their job is not to teach you, but to make you sign up for their subscription service. I have no problem doing that, but they made the app worse to incentivize it. They also use manipulation and gas-lighting tactics. Unfortunately I don't have an alternative so I just use this to stay fresh on the free version while spending money on books instead. Since books prioritize actually teaching and doesn't have AI algorithms. Good luck in your language learning journey."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Changing to 3 stars for the extremely poor Ukrainian numericals speech recognition. It looks like it's not just bad but an obvious bug, like a wrong dataset. I thought it was just me, but it wouldn't even recognize my wife's speech, who is Ukrainian and this is her native language. Not a single number is recognized, even those that sound the same in russian (I an a native speaker). Overall, many other words are stressed incorrectly, and have different variants in the male and female voices."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"the best learning app of all time, I've finished a whole unit on 1 day because it taught me not to make many mistakes or I will have to wait in order for it to give me a heart, but besides super duolingo. this app is very useful if you're trying to learn a new language, or until you find a good language teacher"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is great for getting some vocabulary, and you kind of can figure some grammar from trial and error. But the daily refresh section has gone down to hell in recent months, with the app recommending to ""practice your weak words"" over and over again for months on end. I don't know if the issue is the same in the paid version."

Every second day when I open the app, I get a network error message, then I can't open it for hours. Phone restart, forced stop, nothing works. I just hit my 1000 day streak and now I'm paralyzed."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Using free version. Lessons are good but outside of them, there is way too much extra activity. Sometimes it feels like I'm playing a gambling game. A lot of app addiction tactics are being used too. For example, earning a chest, which can only be opened if you use the app again in the next 6 hours. Also. Please, in the German version, could you make it an option to hide certain character voices. That fake-baby voice of 'Junior' is so annoying. The other voices are fine though."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,A fairly decent learning tool. It would be very handy to have either a learned word look-up or simply a word/phrase guide. Often I've wanted to look up a word or phrase I have learned but cannot without having to use a 3rd party app. More info on sentence structure would be a great extra as well for those who wish to understand the structure and have a deeper understanding of the language they ate learning.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really like this app, it's helping me a lot as an addition to private lessons. The animated characters are amusing. It would be nice if there was an option to hear all of the sentences spoken out loud. the questions that ask you to ""complete the sentence"" for example. It would be good to have a play button on those so that we could hear those spoken out loud as well. If that feature were available, I'd probably rate this a 5."

Then once you do cancel they try to make you continue through the rest of the year so they don't have to give you a refund. I want my money back! I barely even use it. I shouldn't have to still pay for the whole year when you just took my money 2 days ago! Because of this inconvenience, once canceled I'm less likely to return."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Repetition is crucial to mastering a language. But when Duolingo gives you personalized practice followed by testing that doesn't match what you were practicing, frustration and failure are the only outcomes. This is clearly a marketing gimmick to get you to pay for the overpriced premium plan with unlimited mistakes."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"While I adore the app and the way it teaches, some of the voices are absolutely dreadful. I'm learning German, and a German friend was wondering why two of the voices sound like they're talking through a wall. Not clear, understandable. Tends to leave one questioning their understanding. Just have one clear individual, or BETTER YET, let the paying subscribers CHOOSE their own actor! Would make the experience so much better."

You don't really learn why little errors that look correct matter. The app doesn't explain why it's wrong, just shows you what it claims is correct Gaining a heart every four hours is really poor. Sometimes the practice sessions to gain hearts are unbelievably hard too!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app has been wonderful. It has made it possible for me to start learning a language I would otherwise never have the chance to learn. My only complaint is that if I get stuck on a lesson and go through my hearts before I get all the way through it, my daily streak will reset even though I've been trying. It has a streak freeze for 2 days, but sometimes I get really stuck on one and it takes me longer to get through. It should count for my daily streak if I'm trying."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is good. However, there are some good features that are not available at all, such as the unlimited hearts and further comprehensive lessons on kanji. I would also like to suggest that the use of annual calendar could also be helpful to track the user's long-term progress. Overall, it's a nice platform to use for a japanese learner like me."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"good app, would be great, but you need premium to utilize the even basic ""practice lesson courses."" the ones that explain grammar/sentence structure early on. It was a bit difficult due to only having half the information. also getting penalized for mistakes? if you don't get through your lessons in the 5 tries they allow, you don't get to learn. on one hand, it makes you really double down, on the other I'm limited on how much I can study in a givin day. otherwise, I do enjoy doulingo!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"They make it super fun, and I still feel myself learning. Had to turn off notifications because they are annoying but after that it's a superb learning tool Edit: sneaky billing practices (free super that the renews to $80+ all at once) and now it's using up my streak freezes even though I did my daily practice Five star app but removing three stars for the above reasons"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm rating the free version, student budget means free language apps. I enjoy the game style of learning, it keeps me engaged. The variety of voice actors contributing to the recorded lines, paired with unique styles of people representing who I'm talking about also serves to keep me focused on Duolingo. A star is missing mainly because of how thoroughly infested the free version is with premium ads. Every lesson, every review, stops what it's doing so the rainbow owl can promo the premium."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It is very good and helps others to learn multiple new languages. However you have to pay money for unlimited hearts and reviews on your mistakes you only get three day trials so I like it but I want to be able to learn more easily and learn from my mistakes.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I would say this app is great at most things but going in brand new and just starting to learn a new language is difficult. It expects you to already know some of the language and mostly focuses on phrases and not the sounding of the words or any symbols in that language. In general, you need prior knowledge to even get far in this app and it doesn't help that you lose hearts if you get something wrong."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Numerous bugs and quirks detract from the experience. Often when I get a 2x boost as for completing a lesson, it disappears immediately. Since upgrading to Super, the Gems I've been earning are reduced as I can't watch an ad to earn more. There's an option to disable unlimited hearts, but no way to earn them back if you lose them, which makes it all pointless. It's a bizarre situation where you pay for more but get less, and for that reason I will not be renewing my subscription once it expires."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is very helpful and a great way to learn a different language. I also love the podcast! Hearing people speak Spanish from all over the Spanish speaking world has been such an amazing way to advance the ability to understand and pronounce new words and expressions. Thanks Duolingo! Please keep the podcast going, the real life stories are amazing!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Even as a linguist, I've been proud of my streak and felt like I've even learned bits and pieces for a pretty long time. But gradually the spoken examples of at least Irish were replaced by AI instead of real speakers, so that my confidence in learning went out the window. And recently of course even more reliance on AI and layoffs so that even the written representations of the translations can't be trusted anymore. This is what a focus on profit seeking gets us."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I already use some Spanish on a daily basis. This app rated my knowledge and has started me at an appropriate level. I'm disappointed in the mistakes some of the exercises contain that have caused me to fail two different questions/exercises. They were a problem in the app vocabulary that offer incorrect choices. Overall It's easy to use, and I like the variety of games to give me skills in the critical areas of comprehension."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It should have the option to Drag & Drop words in the middle of phrases. If I make a mistake at the beginning of a phrase then I need to tap on every word again to delete everything and tap on each word one more time to form the correct phrase. This is a big waste of time.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app and is great for learning basics. My only request is for an option to request more languages. Personally I cannot find any good, free apps to learn slovakian since it is a more niche language. Still, perfect App for learning languages as it helps with spelling, pronunciation and listening and has conversation-like lessons."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app was really good when I first downloaded it. Every update since then has made it increasingly worse every time. It just did an update an hour ago and now autocorrect doesn't work. I was learning very quickly by repeatedly having the correct word shown. Now the autocorrect function has been deleted. I'm not going to use this app if I have to have a second source to verify what I'm writing is correct. This is supposed to be a convenient way to learn. It is no longer convenient.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"the app sometimes gets ""stuck"" ...I may get to a question, and the suggested words are incomplete for the question. the only way to proceed is to back out and start the lesson over. Additionally, my main issue with the app is that it doesn't always translate the answer, it just confirms that you gave the correct answer. I would prefer to have the answer translated for me in English me so that I know I was correct when I translated it myself."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It was a bit intimidating to learn a second language. However, using the Duolingo app made it so easy. They understand how adults learn. They incorporate the correct method with a lot of exercises that make it fun and easy for any age group to learn! I highly recommend this app! I feel so proud because of all I've accomplished through Duolingo! And, when I'm done learning Spanish, I am going to use the app for German!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Duolingo has been a wonderful app to learn a new language. However I've been having issues with it. It will not play animations or anything of the sorts no matter what i do. Therefore the four stars. Otherwise a phenomenal app to use!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"We all have busy lives. Learning a language is for me an optional element in this case. Duolingo succeeds in sending offensive reminders constantly that I have to practise French. The exercises are repetitive and not stimulating enough. I have to give some credit, as I have acquired some vocabulary. However, it's a resounding non-recommendation from me. Get a dictionary and a book of verbs and study the language properly. Don't allow these silly people to intimidate you with their app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Love the app, it's helped me to 2 languages and I'm currently learning another....but please fix the bug!! Since the last update the app no longer shows progress until you close the app, close tabs and reload. It's very frustrating and time consuming üòû"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I give this a 5/5 because it really helps me and other to do hard languages and it's really fun to! and I love how it's makes me want to do duo with the challenges that you do or trying to get to the leader board! and remember if you miss one day... is start your steaks all over again and if you are a duo lover you know that's super bad so ya! I really recommend for any kind of age!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I would give less Stars but it seems I cannot take this one star off.. Whoever the webmaster is needs to do better. I have to either restart my device or I have to uninstall then reinstall just so Duolingo can reflect my progress. This is very annoying and doesn't make me want to continue with my lessons. The fun is becoming less fun.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've been using it for 8 days. I'm loving it so far. Update; 195 days in, lots of bugs suddenly appearing. Errors rarely fixed, have to see them over and over again through the lessons. Progress is very, very slow. Introduce new ideas, words etc without explanation. Have to guess and hope your understanding of it is correct."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Duolingo for years now to help me with a couple of different languages. I use the free version, and I don't feel like I'm missing out. I would like to upgrade someday simply to support the app. They are continuously improving and updating it. The user interface is great, too. 10/10 recommend!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a very good app. Ads are moderaded, and they don't really disturb. My problem is the grammar in some languages. For example, in German. Even though I use properly the conjugation depending on the kasus (I don't know the word in english), it says it's wrong. Apart from that, it's a very good app. I anyways recommend to use it more as a complement than as your only way to learn a language. P.D: thanks for giving me my dog back hahaha"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have been using duolingo for a long time - recently, I have been learning Welsh. I am incredibly disappointed to hear this rare and at-risk language will no longer be updated. Furthermore, I have zero confidence in an app that gets rid of its human translators to cut costs. If I am not learning a language that has been vetted by humans, on a course put together by humans, what is the point? I can not, in good faith, support anyone using AI for this."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I think I have learnt my lesson: if an app works just fine DON'T UPDATE IT. it has been hell since the update. The app became slow in load Duolingo has been a very helpful app but recently it has been filled up with a lot of bugs causing a lot of lags between each sessions. I observed this started with the recent update.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great learning app. covers all modalities of learning and repeats to learn where needed to check understood. its actually made fun too , like a game ... considering languages were never my stong point naturally, I'm doing well and really enjoying all, the speaking, listening and written, it even provides motivational incentives to keep up consistent daily learning and with realistic targets... so it must be a pretty exceptional app if I can do it ;-)... enjoy! x"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used this to help study Japanese. The quality of the app declined after they partnered with Crunchyroll to appeal to anime fans and I lost most of the progress I made from the previous version, including my mastery of courses and all the in-app currency spent on those. As they now seem to be switching to AI and dismissing a portion of their work force, I cannot justify using this app any further. Languages have too much nuance to be taught with AI, and I won't be able to trust it anymore."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Fantastic language learning app. It's been severely game-ified since the last time I used it. I'm not particularly fond of the approach. I had three days of the 'super' trial, and then was asked if I wanted to subscribe. I'm told it's an ad-free experience however I still got ads during the trial so there is zero chance I'd pay for it!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have been using Duolingo for a while now. It has been a nice experience so far with occasional hiccups. Good job! Inclusive conversation could be extended to include other groups of people with mental and physical conditions, minority culture/traditions like Pacific Islanders, etc. there are many features that can be added on top of same gender relationships, which is the one and only inclusive feature in Duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Maybe this one star review will get somebody to fix the double xp bug I've contacted y'all about numerous times and it still hasn't been fixed. Instead of getting 40xp in the practice hub with the day/night chests, I get 28 or 32xp. I've worked so hard to maintain my almost 30 weeks in the diamond league, but have to work twice as hard since I'm getting screwed out of half my XP for the week (I'm on a PAID family plan)."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a very easy to use app, and for it being free with ads, there aren't that many ads. Having learned a language very fluently before, I know it takes time and repetition to learn a language, and duo lingo does a good job at trying to reward your time and does lots of repetition."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app needs more work for Scottish. The more you learn the new words, the less you hear the new words. There are several words that won't give an audio, so it makes it hard to pronounce the word when you're reading it. Also, if you click on the Scottish word for fill in the blank, the newer words won't sound out, but the old words from earlier in the app when you started will. Please fix this issue. This language doesn't need to be lost."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"(Using ""Super Duoling laid subscription.) I really enjoy the ""game"" set-up. It's super interactive like that and makes it fun! Also awesome how it includes endangered languages and fictional languages! I took off a star because the program does a poor job with grammar and explaining it. Even in the ""grammar explanation"" section of each unit doesn't properly explain what grammar is being used. I use third party resources (Mango Languages online) to learn the grammar."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Easy to use. It has a rewards system to make it ""fun"" to learn. However, that reward system mostly rewards speed. This is fine to quickly recognise a spoken language but leaves little to no room for beginners to practise speaking the words and pronouncing them correctly. So if you power through and select answers quickly, you will be rewarded but taking the time to practice speaking words and sentences aloud will cost you rewards. Why would you rush whilst learning a new language?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Definitely makes learning a language fun (and addicting). Not having a subscription is tolerable, if you're patient with yourself. I wouldn't rely on this entirely for seriously learning a language, because it doesn't cover grammar very thoroughly. Although I understand the necessity of learning a language ""as you go,"" focused grammar study is important. Duolingo would help students more if a quick grammar rule was taught each time a new grammar concept was introduced. This need not be dry!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My daughter was using Duolingo to learn French. I love the idea of it and at first it was working fine. When she reached the Sapphire league she kept getting the answer right but it was marked as wrong! At first I thought it was the grammar (capitalisation/full stops) but even when her answer was identical in every way - EXACTLY the same wording, spelling, accents, grammar, etc. - it was still being marked as the wrong answer. She became very disillusioned and uninstalled it which is a shame."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a fun way of learning and I really like it, but the only thing that absolutely ticks me off is the people who use Super. It gives an unfair advantage to others and while I keep having to be in the champion things with a BUNCH of people who use it, it just feels absolutely unfair. I think that it would be more fair if we were all in different leagues, people who use Super can go against people who use Super and people who use regular Duolingo can go against people who use the regular version"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's amazing!!! the Admins are very active in the community and even gave me my 130+ streak back after I lost it by mistake ‚ù§ as far as language learning, it is very accurate for Spanish AND Hawaiian. although I use it more for Spanish. I have used it consistently outside of my Spanish 4 class and my teacher has noticed and told me she believes I have the capability to be fluent one day! Duolingo is AMAZING and gaining hearts back is easy, just practice!! Thank you Duolingo ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"In the beginning, I thought the speed was too slow for my progression, but after I patiently took several courses, I realized it's actually the perfect speed for me to learn. Really love it. Recommend download it. Oh, and if you really want to enjoy the learning, you should pay for the super, which is really not what I like but necessary for me to stay engaged."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Longtime user first-time reviewer. I used to like Duolingo a lot before it sold its soul to gamify its app for the lowest common denominator. The language progression tree used to feel like an engaging way to learn a language. I used to learn concepts and words quickly. However, with the new language path, it is utterly shocking how little I retain. If you heard that Duolingo is a language-learning app, that's no longer true. It's a game that pretends to teach a language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I really love the app and it's cute characters to help me learn the language I'm currently learning. it's really helpful and really useful if someone from a different country needs help translating things for them. I would recommend this app to my other friends but they are not really interested in it. But a good language app.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's addictive, it's free and I am practicing... I'm not 100% convinced I'm learning the most useful vocabulary most efficiently, so I feel like I have to supplement this app with other study. But it's part of a start. It helps me keep the ball rolling. And overall it is way more practical than it was a few years ago."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great if you're a beginner, but you should branch out into more complicated ways of learning your language. That being said, the heart system makes the game aspect overpower the learning aspect. If you want to learn a language casually, this is a good app that encourages daily lessons."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo makes learning Spanish enjoyable through a variety of exercises. It builds on what you've learned while introducing new words and concepts. Duolingo helps you learn different words and phrases about traveling, school, home life, shopping, work, and many other topics. The app also provides opportunities to practice speaking and writing. One of my favorite activities on Duolingo is matching Spanish words to English words before time runs out. This game challenges and motivates me."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"2024-03: I enjoyed writing the kanjis in Japanese. The latest change is not enjoyable. 2023-08: the fun is back on! The stories are back and more accessible! 2022-11-15: the new update is not getting me motivated. I loved being able to jump from 1 subject to another depending on my mood. Now i'm stuck following a rigid curriculum... And where are the stories? 2022-9-10: we are back on track! Learning the basics, i am so happy with this app!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have weirdly learned better with this than in Spanish class at college. maybe because the lessons are at my finger tips, or maybe it's because I can repeat the lesson until I feel comfortable learning more words. they still count the repeats as a lesson learned and I'm glad they reward you for trying your best and going at your pace. I just wish their other app on apple products were available for Android."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I am a a bilingual person. I wanted to practice Spanish and thought this app would be perfect. It's not. The app doesn't account for the grammar half the time. It weirdly switches back and forth between grammatically correct translation to a direct translation. It's weird. It'll say ""los pans"" to ""bread."" It's PLURAL in Spanish, and I reporting it doesn't so anything. I regret spending money on it. I wouldn't recommend this app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I loved this app. After a few weeks using this for the first time. I'm a new beginner. I noticed that some bugs that need to be fix. The app glitched frequently, for a example, question said ""the girl"" it supposed to answer question and type in ""la Nina"" but I couldn't type it. It give me an errors message. I've reported these glitches. And... There are no grammar tips for helps. Very frustrating. It makes me to unsubscribe duolingo plus edition because of some bugs and glitch. This app is trash"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app seems pretty great at first, but then you figure out that it's mostly just made to make money. The learning is good, but as it gets harder, it makes you feel way more demotivated to actually learn the language. The ads are 99% of the time for Super duolingo, and in the ad, they say they get rid of the ads, so they are literally just getting rid of the ad for no ads. I think you're just better off learning a language from someone in person who actually speaks the language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is a fun game to play! It is well designed to keep you invested. Sadly there is no way to personalize it so our trip has come and gone before we were taught how to speak as a tourist. I am so done with talking about pens and school. Duo, please find a way to personalize the learning. I have no reason to EVER use the work, school or university information that is on my path before I can say turn left or turn right. I have come so close to deleting the app never to return but we keep trying!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The repetition was great at first, but there's not enough vocabulary learning to go with the alphabet lessons. Each time we decipher a word, we should he presented with its English counterpart. We're learning words but don't know what most mean! The exercises are simple & quick to start, but as I get further along, I need and want more translations. Also, there's no oral practice involved. I'm addicted to this ""game"" of language learning, but it could be better."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"this is the third time I've picked it up and definitely the time I've been most consistent. I think deleting other attention grabbing apps helped, but engaging with the whole app too is useful, playing the challenges, utilising the earl bird/night owl double XP loop. A suggestion to add to the app would be a verb challenge game in the practice section, where it just gives you variations of all learned verbs, they work, you sleep etc."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"fun characters make it easier to learn - and much more enjoyable! streaks make you want to come back and learn, along with leader boards. I don't have super, but you only get a short add after you complete a lesson, so not as bad you might think. also you only get 5 hearts (so five mistakes) and if you use them up, either you must refill with gems (earned by completing challenges) or wait a few hours before they refill on their own all in all, it's a great - and fun - way to learn!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I fear if I don't leave a good review, Duo the bird will hunt me down. Please please install so that Duo leaves me alone. (Jk, but it's a pretty good app to learn a language. Especially when you need to travel to another place with an unfamiliar language, you can easily ramp up within a month of consistent use.)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is an excellent app to start learning a new language. The only thing I would say needs improvement would be, more work. I mean to say, give more options to learn. when doing my lessons, I rarely have to write and mostly selecting what I heard, while this helps me learn, it helps alot, I wish you could do other things, possibly more ""hands on"". Like make me create a sentence or a story. I'm not very far in my learning experience here, only two weeks in, so maybe I'm speaking too soon."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Learning a lot in a fun and interactive way. I like the different methods of learning. Lost a star because now in 2024, dealing with the app freezing and I have to restart my phone to get it to work. It just stays on the opening screen and never opens."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The main part is pretty good, but when it comes to the match madness things, it falls apart. You practically need super Duolingo for it, but then they don't give you enough time to complete it. Very clearly trying to get you to spend money on the time extenders, even though you're already paying a monthly subscription just to attempt this."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I find it incredibly dumb that the app doesn't have a mode where people can learn words for everyday stuff. I think its more important to know the words and have an extensive vocabulary first and then proper grammar. Its not a bad app but its not a great one either. At least imo.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app since January 1st as a challenge to myself to learn Latin. However, my gripe is the ""Spell what you hear"" portions, especially since I use the free version. I was stuck on Estne Universita Novi Eburacum for ages. Instead of the app helping me, it just forces you to memorize the failed words and brute forcing yourself into just memorizing them and using auto fill on your keyboard. If they could figure out a better way to implement a spelling feature,I would rate a 5/5."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Makes learning a new language easier, fun and keeps me committed to my goals. Thank you for this smart app. It has helped me learn a new language a lot faster in a short amount of time. I love the thought put into this game and all of the things that were implemented into it just to make it easier for us to learn. I love it, and whoever came up with it is very helpful and definitely intelligent. Thank you to all who were involved in the making of this app, the ideas, goals, etc... Thank you!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,With the New Year offer it is worth the subscription. Without a subscription it can be limiting and frustrating. Generally good as a supplement to other learning. Fun and not so hard. Sometimes annoyingly vague tasks with more than acceptable answer depending on how you read it understand the question...but maybe that's just me. As a free resource it's fine to dip into just not as a main learning route
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It has ben a great experience learning another language. I have tried other programs and this is the one I feel like is sticking because I am able to see, hear, say and spell the words while on a mobil device. Love this program and have recommended it to anyone trying to learn new languages."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Loved Duolingo....at first....but there's no way to retake each level (only a REVIEW option) so realised that as I would progress further with no way to redo a lesson, I found the first unit really hard towards end, only option I found is to remove the language and start completely over. Was willing to pay for the superduolingo up to that point ‚òπÔ∏è"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Soo much fun! Been wanting to learn Spanish for a long time, so glad I came across this app! I practice and learn everyday. The best part is feeling rewarded when you are doing well. Doulingo has made it is easy for me to start at a beginners level while slowly building up my vocabulary. Gives you options to correct your mistakes and weak points as well. Iv been learning for 3 weeks now nonstop and haven't paid a cent! I will eventually buy this for the extra teaching perks."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I used duo 6 years ago, and decided to pick it up again, and my god it has legitimately impressed me with how much it has improved. I'd still recommend using some other apps/listening to podcasts and movies and stuff in the language you're learning once you get better, but never stop using duo. Duo is very good and I would never stop recommending it"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Taking the Hindi course, answers are often incorrect and the app punishes you by preventing you from continuing lessons after you make mistakes. The course is also way too short: after two sections and barely a couple months, the app runs out of new material to teach, after hardly having even taught the basics, and just resorts to asking you the same questions over and over again. Really disappointing and pretty useless."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a great app in learning different languages, and it forces you to consistently learn it everyday or you lose all your achievements on the app. The one thing I find in this app that needs improvement is that, they should allow people to interact through ""voice note"" so that we can be better when interacting with people in another language. Duolingo is great in individual writing skills, and individual speaking skills but interacting speaking skills needs to be improved."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This is a great app to start with, but in about a month you're going to get tired of saying the same stupid sentences over and over. There's no verb conjugation, no way to configure the types of words/topics to focus on, highly limited vocabulary, etc. After two months, it still has me saying, ""The chicken has bread,"" and, ""The boys and girls don't eat rice."" I'm looking now for something more flexible."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"When the offline function was explicit, it worked very well, but now when it supposed to download when the phone is idle (I also restarted the app) It doesn't work at all. But the biggest setback is the new course structure without giving us the choice to choose between the old and new way. You simply cannot deviate from the path, even if you just want to do the stories. You are tied to this linear structure, killing the fun and freedom of learning a language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have been learning German for just over a year. For the most part, the app is really good, but it needs to be used alongside another learning method (classes, etc). My one frustration is that sometimes I am not sure about the answers, so end up guessing. The app tells me I am ""Awesome"", but in reality, I am not sure about my answer. I would rather it showed be the phrase in both English and German in the pop-up box for every question."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Match Madness was a great addition and I appreciate the variety of the questions in the lessons. However I am concerned about the increasing use of AI, especially when it was something decried by earlier loading screen messages in the app. Language is too nuanced to ever be mastered by machine learning and translation is an art."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Sure this may not be ALL you need to learn a language. But my goodness if it isn't perfect for my attention span! I have just started with Japanese and I get encouraged and incentivized to keep going with how fun it is to learn, and at my own pace even! This'll surely set me on the right path for when I put it into practice and expand my knowledge of the language even more. I love this! :D"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Tried this a few years ago to try to improve my Vietnamese (mother's native language). Phrases were quite ridiculous & awkward. Ex: ""T√¥i l√† t√¥i"" = ""I am me"". Decided to try the app again, and found that Vietnamese phrases are just as awkward as before (Vietnamese people would not speak like a lot of the examples). English translations are sometimes as awkward- even to the point of being grammatically incorrect. Don't like that only Northern-style is used as some terms in the South are different."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Edit: since the app has sacked a lot of its human workers in favour of AI, I've uninstalled. Duolingo used to be one of the best language tutorial apps. Sadly a recent update has ruined the app for me. It's unwieldy, and I am struggling to learn where before it was a journey I was very comfortable with. Over time they have removed many support systems (eg. Lesson summaries, exercise discussions, etc.) so now I cannot recommend the app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Interesting app. Helps learn new languages. But I have a problem, please get rid of the streaks, or fix them in some way. People have other things to do in life and can't do their lessons everyday. I just saw my streak, and I lost it because I was doing other things and didn't have time to do my lessons. Please fix the streak in some way, any way you want."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"An interesting and engaging concept on learning new languages. New user but due to learning difficulties I always struggled alot with reading books etc. Duolingo gameify's the content in an enjoyable and slightly competitive way to encourage continuous learning, maintaining a streak which is probably the best way to learn and keep engaged. Having alot of fun so far and actually learning something. ü§ô"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's doable...I think that's the most important thing. You can do 5 minutes or 5 hours of language study. It has its limits, particularly with practicing forming sentences and producing, but that's to be expected. It really helps you keep up the momentum of regular language learning time. The free version is wonderful, and the ads give you a bit of a breather, so if you don't have a budget for language learning right now, you won't have to sacrifice quality for your budget."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Exceptional to use for beginners but here's an option. When you are learning the language of your choice you compete with other users that are learning a different language. I would suggest to separate those learning Gaelic into a Gaelic league & those into other separate leagues as per their own language. This way we would be able to compete with someone with the same challenges. The loophole as it is that I can use the English as a ""cheat"" tactic since I already speak English. Just sayin"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The new look is a lot helpful since it has built in practice and story. This inclusion of music and maths are also very helpful as learning these in private tutoring is expensive. I love Duolingo and I'm encouraging everyone to use it. I love the app ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Edit: This app is excellent to learn any foreign language. Punctuation, Spelling, Grammar, Lessons and Pronunciation are all covered with it.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It is an ok app to learn languages, but recent changes makes it way less effective. I strongly dislike the removal of the grammar explanations and the removal of the forums. They were great tools that I used to use all the time. I stopped learning one of my languages because it was impossible to learn without those tools. The only reason I'm still using the app is that I'm learning a language with very simple grammar and structure. Otherwise I wouldn't use Duolingo"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is progressively getting worse and worse removing any and all features actually usefully. It is no longer a language learning app it's more like a game by having useless leaderboards that do nothing to encourage learning to having a pay wall to stop you from actually improving. You are not allowed to make mistakes or they will make you restart a lesson, they spring new words on you that are unfamiliar and give you no time to adjust leaving you to inevitably fail the lesson. I hate it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love the app, but for a month now it hasn't worked. I have emailed duolingo lots and never receive a reply. I pay for premium. Tried all the steps on line, nothing works, app won't open or load. Maybe once every 5 days and by then my streak is gone and all my points have been used for streak freezes. Very upsetting. I was a top 1% learner last year."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm using this app since a year now nd I'm an using paid version version of the app but what I loved about this app was its animations but in the recent update all the animations are changed which I as a consumer hate Can u please bring back the same old animation style when interacting on app , it helps in maintaining an interactive UI and it makes it more interesting for the user. Hope u fix this in near future"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love learning a new language. that being said, I don't think the competitiveness or the streak counting helps at all. I can focus on winning through the ranks but then I notice that I don't learn as much. Then I try to keep up a streak and when life keeps me too busy to check in, I lose it and it becomes more discouraging... If this app. was only about the learning I would use it a LOT more often."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Overall poorly designed, it gives you a limited scope of the language and repeats a certain subset many times, but entirely omits large amounts of potentially useful words. For example, in the russian course it drills ""apple"" and ""banana"" thousands of times but has no other fruits. I don't even know how to say pear or orange. The content is overly gamified and designed to be extremely annoying and slow if you don't pay for super. And of course there is no grammar. You learn a few random words."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been trying to learn other languages for a while now but I really didn't make for it and it charges a lot for the live(Offline)classes but with Duolingo, I can say that this make this learning process so easier, time effective and efficient . I can learn and practice while doing other stuff so easily . If you're interested in learning foreign languages for any purpose just go ahead with Duolingo. This app make it so much easier to learn and helps to speak. I find it very helpful and cute ."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have been using super (subscription) dor a year now and have been enjoying using the app. I do have a complaint though, there seems to be a glitch with speaking exercises, it does not recognise words sometimes even though im pronouncing it exactly as instructed , even cutting me off mid sentence sometimes with a 'lets move on' even though I am still mid sentence. Sometimes i am done saying the sentence and it will just lag and only after some time ask if I would like to try again. FRUSTRATING!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The Arabic course is very bad for an app like this. There are also alot of very bad pronounciation errors that have never been fixed despite so many reports. New grammatical concepts are never explained and you have to figure them out yourself. Apart from that the app is good, but I think it can be better and AI should be utilised so you can try to have conversations and creatively use the language you're learning instead of just memorising words and meaning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have been enjoying this app for a long time - I am currently on a 1069 day streak, and have been using it casually for sometime before that. However, your recent move to lay off so many translators in favour of AI translation is disgusting. Machine learning programmes can't translate accurately 100% of the time and definitely can't read nuance as well as a human, and for a programme that purports to teach languages this is an awful decision. For shame."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app for competition and motivation. But for language learning, for more authentic content, not the best. They can reduce the number of translation exercises to be better. Anyway, it does help in keeping up your learning spirit and evaluate your language level."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Love the app. The widget feature was what has been helping me keep on my streak.... but now, I am kind of annoyed by the widget not regularly updating the images as often as it used to. About two weeks ago, I have to click and open the app in order to have the image update. And it is kind of demotivating."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a very good app, I rate it 5 star because it's a very great app but the only issue I have is it goes offline sometimes and even though I switch on my data it would still be offline and I wouldn't be able to login or do anything but it's resolved now. am just saying ahead of time. Thank you for the lovely app called Duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"App is fine for learning some vocabulary, but that's it. Used in conjunction with a grammar book for the language you are learning, it's lessons can be good for some extra practice and reinforcement. Otherwise it's clunky and a bit expensive to be a useful tool."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is an exceptional language-learning app that has made my language journey enjoyable and effective. The gamified lessons make learning feel like a fun challenge rather than a chore. The variety of exercises keeps things interesting, and the clear progression helps me build my skills gradually. The app's user-friendly interface and engaging content have truly set it apart. Highly recommended for anyone looking to learn a new language efficiently and enjoyably!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I appreciate the app. It's helpful to brush up on french but I hate the freeze streak intensity. I wish I could turn freeze streaks off. I get on when I gave time I don't need to be inundated with freeze streak reminders and goals. Im sure some ppls learning styles may like that but I find it cumbersome. Please make a way to turn freeze streaks off for ppl who don't need that incentive. For ppl who do like it they can keep it on.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is great for learning new languages but how ever I can't give it five stars because it doesn't have anything to make sure you pronounce the words correctly. I feel like this can be resolved by speech tests. Basically every few levels you have a test, but you don't answer by clicking buttons, but rather by talking into the microphone and it rates you on how good you pronounced the word."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The timed game only gives 90 seconds to answer several lengthy questions, and that's ridiculous. Finding the randomly assorted words in long sentences took quite some time, especially since I'm only a beginner. This caused the timer to run out, and I had to choose between buying a timer boost or starting over. Honestly, this challenge didn't seem to contribute to improvement but only added stress and fried my brains"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"If you want to learn a language for free, this app is a great place to start. There are many quests and the task of mantaining your streak to keep you motivated. The words you learn from there are fairly accurate to their meaning and definition. Their bite-sized lesson also proves effective when learning a new language. There are also limits to the amount of mistakes you can make in one lesson. There's also plenty of ads on there if you aren't using Super Duolingo. Overall, it is a good app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent! The blend of text, image, word selection, and audio makes for a great learning experience. In addition to challenges and awards. The paid version is best. You are able to practice more with unlimited hearts."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"if you can make time then this app is amazing, but I must provide some expectation: don't expect to start speaking another language after a week, a month, or even a few... it has several months and I average 15 minutes every day and I feel like I am just starting to be able to use it... I dunno all I am saying is that learning a language is hard and Duolingo is an excellent tool to make a bit more bearable and possibly even motivate you. ultimately though the user is who makes this app useful."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Not the best app out there for language learning as it doesn't actually teach you the grammar so that you can construct your own sentences, it just teaches you phrases. I was also extremely disappointed to learn recently that a large number of HUMAN staff were laid off in December 2023 and replaced by AI. I do not want to support AI as it makes me deeply uncomfortable. The app is just not good enough in my opinion."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a very good app for staying consistent, I've been doing some Japanese every day - even if just a little bit - for like a month and that's a great deal more than I was doing before (which was none). Plus I like the fact that you can have many languages all at once but there's no pressure to actually do them all at once or be equally consistent in all of them. I've been consistent in Japanese, but not in the other 7 courses I have, but it's nice to know I could be doing them if I wanted to."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I don't want super duolingo because I like the challenge of limited tries, plus the language I really want to learn (Thai) is inexplicably missing when various fantasy languages and other odd features are being added. The app won't stop trying to sell it at every opportunity though."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall, the app is great. Though there are a few problems, like it won't use actual speakers of the language to pronounce the phrase to make it feel more real. I feel like if you get a perfect on the practice for hearts you should get 2 hearts instead of one."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Was great until they removed the discussion feature. Now it's just okay. The discussions usuallt clarified issues with the exercises The English translations have started to make less sense as well, sometimes being nonsense. considering dropping to two stars if it continues and have already cancelled my subscription."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love learning and practicing Spanish with Duolingo. I highly recommend it. I like the pace, and if you get something incorrect, the app goes back so you can redo the exercise, which reinforces your learning. Give it a try if you want to learn a new language, you'll be glad you did! Gracias, Duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This really is an amazing app. I am learning Spanish, and they really do teach well. But, my only problem is that the app thinks I am in China. China has an 86 before their phone number, while I am in the US and have a 1 before my phone number. The thing is, it will not let me change the country I am from, and it thinks I have an 86 before my phone number which I do not. This means it won't let me make an account."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Duolingo French is a wonderful app that makes fun and easy learning. However my greatest challenge is the speaking part. I often use the recorder to record my voice but it keeps telling me that my response isn't correct and for that reason I can't move over to the next page. I have been in stage 2 for over 3 days now and can't advance until I answer correctly the speaking part. I don't know if the recorder isn't recording my voice or the audio isn't recognizing my answers as a native. Pls help!

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Probably the best free app for learning a new language out there. While there are definitely incentives to pay for the premium version, the free version is still very usable, with only minimal compromises to push you towards the premium subscription. Would definitely recommend."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a great app for learning languages, but I wish it would teach more age- specific lessons. It also constantly needs updating, but I am fine with that because updates only take one to two minutes and every update improves the app! So overall highly recommend, especially for beginners!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"they fired almost everyone who worked for them and replaced them with AI. They lock the best features for education behind a paywall. Duolingo is fun, but you'd need to get a premium account and devote at least 30 minutes a day to actually learn a language with it in a reasonable time frame. It's Stories are probably the best feature they had, and now it's premium only."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"fun to practice, I just wish we would have more chance's to get super duo for longer I appreciate that this app has a free use but some can't afford even 9.99 for the basic subscription, and I feel in my opinion that you learn better with super duo, than the basic bc you can practice longer and fix your mistakes easier to improve yourself. but I still enjoy the free version."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've had Duolingo for about five years, used it almost every night, and I have a 1743 day streak. But I'm uninstalling it now because of their layoffs and shift to ""AI"" (it's machine learning), rather than actual human translators. Relying on machine learning is going to worsen the quality and reliability of the translations. If they reverse course, I might pick the app back up, but they've lost a lot of goodwill."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it is so fun I've been doing it for almost 2 years (nonstop, but I've used a ton of streak freezes on days where I didn't have internet access) and it goes well with my Spanish class. it feels like it reinforces the things I learn in class and let's me learn a few extra things as well. recommended to anybody who is taking Spanish in school especially"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've never learned a language faster. I don't even need to take notes but I do practice the writing. you learn basic conversation first, like saying someone is a nice or cool teacher or doctor or lawyer and you order food. I practice the alphabet they show me. this app actually helps me memorize the letters and sounds at my pace. I highly suggest users do multiple lessons every single day, and learn a language you can actually use."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I was originally hopeful, and even happy with my vocabulary acquisition in my language course, repeatedly changing the learning track meant that I was never confident in the progress I was making or sure that I was making progress at all because by the time I finished a unit, the track would change and I would be in the middle of a path teaching me things I already knew while skipping things I never was taught. And then duolingo leaned into AI to create its lessons rather than people. It shows."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I love this app because it has been helpful in my language learning journey but I'm rating it low because since the recent update, even when the network connection is good it keeps showing in your app that I'm offline. Same ""offline mode"" network is what I'll use to stream videos on YouTube and Netflix and there are no issues. You guys have to fix this up ASAP so you don't lose your reputation. This issue is killing the fun in this app!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app has been going worse and worse with each update. Before I had access to different levels about different things, now it's only one road. In Japanese I don't have access to stories anymore, which I could before. Also in Japanese, weird translations and phrases. In Danish I am forced to write sentences, when I don't want to learn writing, but speaking the language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's a fun and an effective way to learn, but it's buggy. We're always getting updates but rather than fixing the bugs, the updates all seem to be just new games and tricks that get you to buy power-ups. Rather than trying to make the app better, they're scheming to get more money. I already pay a monthly fee and trying to squeeze more cash out of me from the store with every update is gross. I'm kind of sunk into it, but I'm still thinking about switching to a different app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It became impossible to continue lessons on the app because the hints were so screwed up and they didn't organize the lessons in a way to understand the brand new concepts. I am extremely upset because I cannot get any partial refund since they make you pay for the whole year upfront and the issue only got this bad when I reached a new section. I also had emailed customer service and received no actual response even after 2 weeks. I had a 4 year streak but enough is enough.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great for reading. Only good for speaking if you repeat everything, repeat everything! Not great for writing. Helps with listening but it has silly characters with silly accents. Even so, I'm learning new vocab and grammar and hopefully I'm retaining at least some of it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app, but in the beginning (at least in Spanish) it really misses a key word, which is surprising. For example, I'm almost done with unit 1 and it still hasn't mentioned a single thing about the word ""nosotros"". Maybe it doesn't feel that that's important or maybe it isn't used much? I just started learning Spanish so I'm not sure"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I get it: it's free. But it is absolutely TERRIBLE to learn from. There are NO explanations of conjugation, gender, or definite/ indefinite articles. You'll just guess and usually get it wrong. Further, the creators must not speak English natively. Their spellings of common sounds are always wrong. Also, so far, there's nothing for spoken language. Which is what most of us are trying to do. Just spend the money on one of the other language apps. You'll learn faster and get a complete lesson."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I didn't think I would ever update my rating, but that's how annoying its become. With every update, more and more animations in the app aren't respecting the animation setting. This is especially noticeable when completing a lesson. I'm about to churn away from this app because they're trying to force users to stay on their app just a little bit longer and it's seriously annoying. I'd naturally stay on the app if it's interesting, not because of animation lock."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Pros: Enjoyable interface. Great materials & variety of aspects. Formatted for efficient & coherent learning. The difficulty level good for progressing, unlike other apps from random levels. Progression path clear. Cons: AmEnglish. Subscribers still are asked to pay for extras. Unnatural word order translations (Italian>English). Match Madness words appear severely delayed to lose & buy boost. Ramp-up boost always deducts gems but not always acknowledges the 80xp was successful & asks to repeat."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoy the app. My son and I are both both learning French and the Duo Lingo keeps him motivated is awesome . Good repetition, introduces new words and phrases in an intuitive manner. I sometimes have an issue with hearing slight differences, ano or agno. Phonetic spelling on request would be a suggestion Thanks for a very solid app"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Between the constant removal of useful features and aggressive incorporation of AI in place of human experts, Duolingo is really not worth anyone's time any more. It's still decent for picking up the very basics of a language, but for anything more advanced, you're better off looking for other material or hiring a real teacher."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Needs more focus on learning / meeting learning goals, and less on xp. XP and leaderboards can motivate, but promotes pointless games like Match Madness which don't teach. I set my own goals, but then Duo keeps moving me around the path so difficult to track. Little support or clarification if you're stuck, since removal of forums. Pronunciation checks are poor, sometimes I know I'm wrong but get marked correct. Different offerings for iPhone and Android. Buggy as hell recently too, no support"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Been learning french for 200 days and I can still confidently say I still don't understand one sentence a french person would casually say without translation. The app doesn't encourage you to write, understand different sentences and talk by yourself but rather keeps teaching you new vocabulary and makes you translate sentences. Duolingo is good to teach the basics of a language such as simple grammar, new vocabulary and new letters. But not good to learn to speak an entire language"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo relies on repetition for learning, so you memorize set sentences rather than learn to actual build and use a language. Grammar explanations are laughably bad, and it recently deleted all the user explanations from my course, which actually taught something. The AI also forces you to learn set English translations, or it will not count your answer even if the meaning is the same. I'm often irritated by the app and quit because it's not really allowing you to learn the language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like the fact there are different voices so you can here multiple pronunciations. I would like an explanation as to why sounds change and how depending on where they are, beginning or end of the sentence, also there are words that I can never seem to pronounce right or can 1 time then not again even if I say it the same way, usually when the letters are pronounced differenly at the end. It would be helpful if they could add a feature to help you pronounce the words you keep getting wrong."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"while the new update gave us new method for kanji practice by making it more various and challenging (mixing the kanjis in single practice), it's horrible for selective singular kanji learning where you want to remember a specific kanji and repeating it. please give us the option for the old kanji practice, or I'll even lower the ratings. also you haven't balanced the ads volume and the lessons volume, it's a hazard when the ads blasting with high volume eventhough the lesson's volume is fine"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Wonderful language learning app. Language library is huge, interactive and engaging lessons, and actually free trials of Super if you don't know if it's worth it or not. Great at making sure you remember sentence structure, words, and pronunciations."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Bad app. Cares more about making you buy addons than teaching the language. If you don't buy addons, you probably won't learn much from this app. Also, too often, in listening exercises, words and sounds are truncated or omitted at the beginning or end of the phrase. Upon inputting what you hear you lose a life for duolingo's mistake."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,there used to be a vocabulary of the words you've learned. It was very useful. It's sadly gone. The app could also do better when providing theory for the unit. Like what forms the words might have. Now you just kind of try to pick up while doing lessons instead of having a definition somewhere you can come back to.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Easy to use, does a good job of motivating you. Adverts are annoying in free version but it's free. Would like ability to tailor learning more. I wanted it for holidays so did not really want to learn about the school setting. Needed more town, food types and directions focus.."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,they fail to give you points sometimes for stupid things set you up to need to buy the plan if you don't want to see disgusting ads. It's nice to be able to practice free but everything pushes you to pay and they push competitive behavior so it's not fun. I haven't reviewed before because I don't want to be snotty about all the little things that bug me but they demoted me again then offered to let me spend money to stay in the league- it annoyed me so much. They asked again for review so here.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"the ap is great, but I only gave 4 star because some of the words translated are pronounced wrong depending on if the male or female voice are speaking, also the male voice says some of the phrases so fast that you can't hear one or two words so you have to play it back in the slow mode, otherwise I love the app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So far, the app itself seems great. But the ads are intrusive, sudden, and LOUD. Really ruins the whole experience. Quiet down your ads, or default them to mute, and maybe I'll add more stars. The app also advances through screens without me hitting the ""continue"" button."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have used it for Italian and, currently, French over the years to get some basic language skills for holidays. It's better than just a phrase book but the frequent push to upgrade to the paid version is intrusive. I understand they need to make money but I find only having so many 'lives' makes it more challenging."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used Duolingo for over 10 years and had a ""super"" account. The choice that was made to force out ACTUAL HUMAN translators in favor of ""AI generated"" content has made this app UNUSABLE. Not only is the human element of people knowledgeable in fragile languages gone, but most of the sentence structure in those lessons is complete gibberish and incoherent to native speakers. Wish I could rate this app lower. Don't use this if your plan is to learn the language before travelling somewhere."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a fun language app with gamification. It has made it much more engaging to have specific goals and rewards that can be gained through engagement within the app. Would love to see some character customisations and more options to work in groups through the app. Overall I can't say anything bad about the app, maybe a couple of glitches here and there but they're generally speaking quickly taken cared of. Thank you for an amazing app !"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I heard the news that Duolingo has laid off a majority of their translation staff and are replacing them with AI and a small staff to review output. I am already against AI in most of its applications, but especially in this case, learning language is a human experience and replacing that with a glorified randomizer to save a few bucks is riduculous. So I am saying goodbye to Duo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very fun learning, I also appreciate your goal and how much you're working to achieve it! I love that we can get the super version for free if we learn enough for a limited time and it makes learning really fun!!! I wish that there was more typing and talking in languages like Japanese but besides that I love pretty much everything! the user friendly UI, the weekly posts, the streak and widgets, EVERYTHING"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love this app but the new update caused problems. Sometimes I have to do the same lessons over and over because it does not track my progress. I did notice that if I close and then open the app aga, I am sometimes be able to move forward to the next lesson."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This game is amazing. I like that there's a lot of languages to choose from when creating a course. Also, I realized there are no ads. That's the second thing I like about this app. Literally, just learning the language from Duolingo, you can learn so much and you can speak the language. But honestly... There's one tiny little thing that I don't really like. I can't look at my very own profile. Though, I will really appreciate that fixed. I still like this learning game a lot. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Some aspects are good but what is annoying is that on the end lesson (wrap up lesson) it will throw stuff at you that wasn't covered in the section. Probably so you waste hearts and need to buy more. Also, don't even bother with this app if you cannot perfectly roll your rrr's because the speaking exercises will repeatedly fail you on words like aeropuerto and rosa (spanish).There is also no theory or explanation on grammar etc they just throw you in to words and phrases without any structure."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"the app used to be really good but they have removed so many features! you can't see the questions others have asked for similar mistakes. if there's a concept you don't understand there isn't anywhere in the app to look up more information. you used to be able to have ai chats in the language for practice that they removed. when there is a drop down for word selections, they don't tell you why there are multiple options underneath and there is no tutorials that explain it ahead of time."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I was learning Korean right now. For me, the experience of learning Korean is going great. But there's one thing that irritates me. Which is leaderboards. I was already in the Diamond League but go down to Obsidian League. For me leaderboards don't make people learning a new language. Leaderboards only make the top ones are more motivated to learn but the average and demotion ones don't have the energy to learn. It would be great if there's a leaderboard settings in a new update."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I use it to learn Korean and the stages are jumping from syllables and easy words to whole long complicated sentences in no time. From Stage 4 I get new words (that aren't marked as new words) and whole new sentences in almost every lesson. When I decide to practice the level, it only gives me a few new words and mostly words from the previous stages. Also, NO explanation whatsoever! E.g why we add different endings to the words, why we have 2 Goodbyes. You have to find it on your own elsewhere."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Easy to use and fun! However there is a missing feature. I can't find a list of new words that I've learned. It would helpful to review from time to time, especially when I encounter a word that I've seen before, but I can't reminder the meaning. So I have to switch to a language dictionary. That failure has me looking for an alternative language learning program. Seems like it would be a very easy feature to program and include."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pretty good app, I really enjoy using it I feel like it could help people learn a new language if determined enough. One thing I do not like about it though is the heart system, it kinda makes me feel less motivated because I then have to earn more hearts in order to continue a lesson and if I'm mid lesson it will just kick me out If I run out of hearts. Other than that I really enjoy the format of this app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've always wanted to learn another language but thought it would be too hard. Duolingo is a genius app in my opinion!! It really is making learning easy and fun without costing a small fortune in tuition. The only reason I haven't given 5 stars is because it needs more explanation for the use of (what seems like Oh do many) different scenarios for verbs in my chosen language, German. Verbs are the only thing I am struggling with......... aber Ich lieber dich Duo!!! Danke"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Lesson curriculum changed without warning, so continuity with previous learning was disrupted. This was done without my being offered the option to change or a chance to opt out. Now, my practice or review lessons cover material that I have never been exposed to."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Surprisingly fun for this 60 year old who doesn't like video games in general. Nearly two years in now, I am not confident in speaking to someone, 1000 word vocabulary but unless I want to tell someone my penguin eats cake is pretty useless vocabulary. Very recently things are more complex, but the vocal prompts do not always match the choices offered. This is getting to be an issue for continuing my streak as only give errors are allowed in a lesson."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is perfect if you want to learn a new language. It's so addicting that I do it all day. I would rate 5 star if it would stop talking about Super Duolingo and showing ads after every lesson. Luckily the ads aren't long, but they still get in the way."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I think that duolingo has a good foundation for language. Learning and provides a less textbook structure method of approaching language learning. This definitely couldn't replace a real life teacher in a classroom setting with a textbook. But I think it performs well for what it does.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"While the update is cool, it's causing the app for my phone to not give me credit for when I complete lessons, so I'm not getting the gems from the chests and not getting the goals for the monthly badge even though I did them and keep track of it. I posted this in May, it's been 5 months. PLEASE FIX THIS. Edit: It's January and I'm still having this problem. I have to do 50 quests for the badge and won't be able to because it's still not giving me credit for completing the one of the goals."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"First, I pay for this app. The cost a day is that of a tall starbucks drink. I see a ton of negative reviews since the last update. Honestly, I have zero problems. The complaints seem like ppl who may not be able to learn academically or tech swavey. So some advice: the predictive text issue, you need to go to your phones settings, to keyboard, and add the language you're learning. It helps. For voice issues, speak slowly and into your phones mic. Also, issues may be due to phones' ages."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Started using the app in Dec 2020. Felt that learning was going well due to the way you were introduced to concepts. In July 2021, they made a coding change that made the apples useful, more restrictive & required you to buy points as you only got 5 hearts a day. I took a year off. The new structure is useless. Learning Concepts and Grammer concepts are not even introduced. You are asked to pick the pronunciation between 2 words & not told what the word means. It's just conversations. USELESS."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have gone from conflicted to hating this app. I play every day, yet some days I start & it tells me I haven't played the day before & requires me to unfreeze it. I don't know if this is because I travel a lot & am in different time zones & it throws the app off, but it becomes so frustrating. I honestly, in 4 months, haven't learned much of anything & feel I'm wasting my time."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best app as it helps us to learn different languages and also help us to interact with people in their own language.And also we does not require large data and storage to use it. It help us to learn many languages like Korean , English and many more... It is very easy to operate it . A normal person can also operate it . And it was very nice experience to use it .I am very glad after using it .It also help me to learn a language .It is a nice app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a great language app, I love it's user-friendly interface, I've always enjoyed using it. The only problem I have is not being able to speak in exercises, cause it never stops to load and then it has been giving me a ""you're offline"" response even when I'm sure nothing is wrong with my internet connection. Please fix this and get 5 Stars"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app since July 2021. I really loved it's experience and the way they teach you through very basic to intermediate level. The user interface makes it very easy for a totally new person to understand. I would have given a more star if it has a bit more than intermediate knowledge, but for a beginner it's just awesome...!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I got up to a 565 day streak and that's as high as it will ever go. I'm deleting the app in protest of Duo's increase of AI usage and layoffs. It was great while it lasted, but now with the increase in AI the app is not heading in a good direction. Replacing creative human minds that produce quality lessons for an AI that can make constant errors on a google-translate level is not how I want to learn."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app since 2020. It used to be very good, but recently after some updates it's juat become a tool to waste your time. Now it's just about practising some stupid sentences for a million times. I am specially talking about the Italian course. There are very good stories though and they're the only reason I haven't removed the app yet. They say learning a language by duolingo is better than wasting time in social media but their app is just as much time wasting as social media."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great learning app. It has definitely been great for me. I do wish some things were more optional as far as learning to your custom style. Also unfortunately there is some slight pressure to buy the premium package so that you can learn better but it is very cheap and I get that they need to make money to support the app. Those two reasons are why I give it 4 stars instead of 5
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a fun and great way to learn new languages , Its practices and tips really help you when trying to learn a new language. They are also really motivational when learning, encouraging you to keep up with learning and meet your goal for the language you've learned and being able to show your progress to friends is really nice too. I definitely recommend this app!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best free app for learning vocabulary. Finish first section to ublock story section with dialogues.

Minus for putting a lot of similar question but with different gender/plural/the un which is really frustrating. Ask same question instead of similar ones with added one letter l"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like this app, the aesthetics are nice, and it's fun to learn a new language. I just wish they would give a full dictionary of the words once you've passed that section. I also wish they taught more basic things like grammar, numbers and colours. Like the fact that I know how to say ""this is my bicycle!"", but I have to look up on Google how to count to 10 is kinda crazy Yes I know there's a kids app, but I feel like you could maybe just add another ""tab"" on the main app for these basic things?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great language learning app. Easy to keep a habit, I've kept most of my French and even learned some more despite not using it regularly outside Duolingo. Not to mention confidence speaking! Affordable subscription as long ss you get the year-end promotion. One star off for the occasional bugs, pointing out errors I didn't make (while not correcring the one I did) and janky AI voices and sentences."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Stopped working properly recently. Audio doesn't work most of the time. There's just no sound even if it's listening exercise. But sometimes also other problems like pictures not loading. Would really love to continue using the app but now i simply can't.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Many bugs. In btwn exercises, speaking/listening ones are turned off on its own even after turning it on again manually. No I hadn't touched the ""can't listen/speak now"" option but it smhw turns it off again! And the 2XP booster isn't always activated, just now I was completed one level and got the booster but it disappeared when I went to another lesson. Plus, it would be better if you rank normal and super users seperately, it's not a fair competition right now. Gems are also hard to gain."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The quality of written English is getting worse and worse over time, the changes made a year or so ago to how courses are structured have noticeably slowed my progress, and now they're firing writers to get AI to write the lessons instead. It only gets the second star out of Stockholm syndrome, as I've now been using it every day for too long to suddenly go elsewhere. Used to be better than it is now, could have been even better, opportunity squandered by greed."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's the best app for learning any language you wish to. It teaches you everything, scratch by scratch. Its fun and one of the most useful app i have ever downloaded. Edit: Hello! I am back to change my review, recently they have removed the discussion centre from the exercises. Since it was the only way i could get to understand the (Turkish) grammar but they changed it so i would take away 1 star from my review. Thank you."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like the app. And I am learning. But I, personally, would like to learn how to conjugate a verb, rather than just see it appear and figure out that's third person plural or that's second person singular. That may be the opposite of a lot of people. Also they give the monthly cost of a service, but I can only buy it a year at a time. Is it not available for shorter periods? And what the heck do I do with all the gems I have earned?"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Apps like duolingo really makes you wonder how there are still conflicts in the world Learning is free fun and simple and i think it is a MUST NEED to anyone learning a language If i could rate it even more i would but the effort put and all the people who made duolingo possible gracias mucho! Only problem i have is that match madness is to difficult to get stars on
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"the app is great and all, but my issue is with the booster purchase through gems. i need there to be a confirmation pop-up that shows up whenever you want to get them (more preferable at the middle of the phone screen). this night makes it the fourth time i'm buying the 5x booster due to my annoying phone, and i'm fed up. üòï no other issue whatsoever. it's a great app!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have been using the app to learn Spanish for some time, and it has been very helpful. However, it has pop culture language like Valerian, but doesnt have real languages such as Bosnian/Croation/Serbian, which is just plain offensive. This would be easy for them to add, because its basically 3 langs in 1. Also, I refuse to pay for Super, because they fired staff to use AI. Why pay for something I can go to Bing to use for free? I want real people formulating my exercises, not developing tech."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,What's the deal with the weird passive-aggressive notifications to guilt people into using the app? It just comes off as childish and not motivating at all. The spammy email reminders are not desirable either. These days there are better language apps available that don't use such strange tactics to try and get you to study.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Not a single explanation. There is no way whatsoever of knowing why our answers are right or wrong. Whether you are a free or paid user doesn't matter. There used to be sentence discussions which helped with this but they're gone. There is a (very expensive) paid AI that provides explanations but only for IPhone and on select courses. As an android user you're stuck with nothing and even paying for super is a bad deal as it doesn't provide the much needed explanations.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"FUN APP WITH TERRIBLE ADS. Great at introducing you to a new language and at giving a taste of it before spending any money on a course. Although it's not enough on its own, but helpful for practicing. I give -1 ‚≠ê for showing political propaganda ads and promoting stupid games. No, I will never buy the stupid winter themed game. It's stupid. Please, make your ads better."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"very good app and materials for learning new languages. I just wish they spent more time reinforcing the vocabulary learned than introducing new one too quickly. The more lessons you do on one day, the more complex it gets as opposed to done 1 lesson one day and practice before moving on to the next lesson. Overall, it is a great resource to start learning a new language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love Duolingo! I highly recommend this app. I have learned so much through the fun activities and being able to go at my own pace. I love that there is review options and I can go over all the things I've learned so far. The variety of different forms of learning is also very helpful. They also have tournament leagues that really play into my competitive nature and helps me keep coming back to learn some more.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Edit- another update has made this app worse. 229 day streak and my Italian collegue is correcting Duolingo often. No assistance to understand grammar rules or anything explaing sentence structure. It's not a learning app, it's a game. 3 updates in 4 month, which messed with how I felt I was progressing. I'm learning how to describe my home now but the alphabet hasn't been touched, the learning curve is more akin to a rollercoaster."

Duolingo makes lessons fun and interesting, I would definitely recommend duolingo to others who are interested in learning a new language and getting to know a language because of travelling or moving to a knew country and many more!! I highly recommend Duolingo!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The changes they took made it worse. You used to be able to do way more with rewards you could spend your gems on, it made it seem a lot more fun and game-like which is a good thing when you are trying to learn something and stave off boredom but they removed it and now Duolingo seems like all business all the time. No fun! Plus the leagues only serve to depress anyone who cares about it enough to try. This is the worst way to teach something I've ever seen. If it wasn't free I'd be mortified"

Before it was so much now you can see that you don't have too much. I was always worried that I wouldn't understand someone who spoke fluent Spanish because I am learning but they added a lesson where it was just talking as if it were a real person. This shows me I would be able to understand. Doulingo is a confidence builder and a fun learning game. If I could rate it higher I would. ü•≥üòçüíØ"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,A really good app to start off and learn any language that you're interested in learning. I'm on a 43 days streak and I'm still going on. There are a few things that are a bit wrong since I'm learning a language I should've known but sadly wasn't taught. My mom has noticed that it adds words to make the sentences more long but otherwise is teaching me good.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have tried many language apps and programs and Duolingo has impressed me. I know over 5 languages already and I feel it has never been as easy and affordable to learn a new one. The app is very user friendly, and it tailors exercises in a way that is fun to do. You also feel part of a community of learners, which makes learning motivating even if you are by yourself. I love the product design and investing on the monthly fee is also well worth it when compared when other options out there"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It is a great app when paying for it. Not sure about the progress yet as it's too early to say. Unfortunately the free version is very limited. Voice recognition does not work very well and needs to speak really loud to be recognised.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"great lessons that slowly introduce more language with good repetition, and I love that you can see the spelling and hear proper pronunciations. can practice hearing, reading, and writing. I don't like you are penalized for getting something wrong. if you are struggling or make mistakes you lose hearts and sometimes can't move forward that day because you made 4 mistakes...which I think is kind of silly. obviously you probably need more practice"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app has steadily been moving its priorities from teaching languages to profit, now more than ever. The removal of the discussions feature was bad enough, as it was a great way for learners to better understand important nuances of a language. But to shift towards AI speaks volumes on Duolingo's ethos, considering AI can't translate properly or even pronounce statements in a language properly. Duolingo has reached a point where it may be actively detrimental to one's language learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app struggles to end some lessons now, getting stuck loading infinitely after completion. And because the app is now a straight line I cannot continue sifting through the chaff because I cannot complete the story in the pathway. It's still impossible to find lessons that covered the areas of a language you need most, and now they are outsourcing translation to AI so any future updates are just going to drop in quality. The bird is dying, slowly."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm learning Italian, and as someone who has learned Italian before, the very first introductory unit is horrifying. I've gotten exercises where I've had to repeat names - what exactly am I learning in those? I've also gotten exercises where I've had to repeat ""Ah"" - why? What's the point? The lessons are horribly put together and if you really, truly want to learn another language to a point where you can speak it, understand it and understand how it works, there are much better ways than this."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo recently laid off 10% of their translation contractors to us ai. Recently, people have been noticing more translation mistakes in courses. It's been shown that AI will just make up whatever sounds right, regardless of what's actually right. Additionally they paused the Welsh course despite incredibly high demand for it. These moves were bad for people, workers, and learners. I would advise you to delete the app, your account, and find other avenues to learn."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I don't like the random words they throw in for you to repeat the correct option without saying what on earth it is . definitely not enough time to go over past learning .it seems v rushed to me . some basic months of the year ,numbers ,days of the week colours etc would be useful. yes I get the sentences right but it's kinda obvious if your English is good.but I don't really know it"

I've been learning French with them and enjoyed the app so far, but I've read that they will not by finishing their Thai language course, which is disappointing.

I don't always have a lot of study time, so I really rely on those 20-30 min daily play breaks--they add up. I just bought a year of Falou, another language-learning service, yet I return to Duolingo at least twice as much. Thanks for a great language learning tool!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo needs urgently, as a language learning platform, to have the app in Portuguese of Portugal because Brazilian is not the same language and this makes so that in a lot of exercises you get it wrong because you respond in a foreign language as if it is yours. Please fix it. Otherwise, it's a deal breaker!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I would not get this app. I paid for the family plan and it did not give me the ads but it still was in the free version mode. I've tried getting help to correct it. The e.ail that was sent was a generic email and not helpful at all. Still didnt work right. And you cannot contact Duolingo by phone of course only through email. They do not get back to you right away. Still waiting to hear back from them for the second time. Don't waste your money.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like it, it makes sense and does pretty well. Though, I do have a question. Why does it allow users to disable certain lessons (like speaking and listening for example) for accessibility if it's still going to be given? (I'm hard of hearing and I usually just reject the listening and speaking parts, even though I have it turned off)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good for reviewing and practicing, but not a teaching app. There is no actual teaching or explanations; just basic practice. You will need to Google or, better, use this alongside an actual language teaching app, program, site or book/books. No vocabulary dictionary or collection of words covered up to where you are in tye course, either. Good to practice, though"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"As you may be aware, Duolingo somewhat recently reoriented its business model, which is to say fired a significant portion of staff and flooded the app with relentless advertisement. Lessons for less common languages have deteriorated massively in quality, and I again cannot overemphasize the omnipresent ads. The lessons are also bizarrely presented as a means for you to compete with other people, with your own actual progress along a language's lessons being secondary. Use a different service."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Doesn't teach, just throws you into guessing words til you chose right. It's pay to win (ridiculous for a lang learning app) Updates course & messes progress, whole units added that you already ""passed"" but never learned. Repetitive not in useful way, just boring. Don't use to actually learn a lang, use it like flashcards once you already started learning the lang, except it doesn't let you choose what to learn, lessons are fixed & you have to do them in order. 'Gamified' stuff just frustrating"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You should be able to make flashcards and choose what categories you want to learn first. Ex: ordering at restaurants, shopping, compliments/ 'thank you and you're welcome'. That'd be way more time efficient for people who are traveling soon or need that language for work so they wouldn't have to focus on a category that won't be that helpful for work or traveling. Also a monthly & yearly progress graph like the weekly one would be nice"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I opened up the app to continue my streak and saw that I dropped down one league, which was no problem. I click the continue button and another box pops up asking me to pay gems to stay in the league. It was so random and unexpected that I clicked to use the gems, causing me to lose 10000 gems. Despite not having a lot, I save up my gems, so this loss was very disappointing. I feel like this could have been avoided were the boxes not so big and if there was some kind of confirmation afterwards."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Completely garbage as of last update. Keeps freezing after a question, or failing to pick up speech at all. App in general always getting worse instead of fixing old bugs. They keep doing weird irrational things like making it harder ty type rather than use the word bank (which impairs learning), they push their useless microtransaction-bait ""challenge"" a ton, and they don't fix bugs with the speech recognition that have persisted for years. The devs should be bloody ashamed."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"for me personally the app is great to supplement what I am already learning with my polish tutor. it is helping me practice what I know more regularly and retain it better. my only reservation about the app is that it doesn't teach you the Gramma and conjugation, simply the words and phrases so I learn that with my tutor or look it up myself to be able to gain a full understanding of the language. it's good practice I just wouldn't solely use it to learn a language properly"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have a one year streak and paid for super Duolingo. I feel like I've wasted a year on this app. It's like a game that's not fun and you won't really learn anything. Trust me and find nearly any other learning option. For some languages like Japanese there are excellent games on Steam that will teach you so much more in a day versus a month on Duolingo. It also doesn't support traditional Chinese. This app has filled me with regret. Please learn from my experience. Avoid.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have been using the free version for about a month now. I am learning German and French. I am really enjoying this app. I would absolutely be willing to pay for the full version. Everything is easy to navigate and easy to use. There are so many features to help with pronunciation. The cheerful sounds make completing the level feel like game play. Two thumby thumbs!! üëç üëç Thank you for such a nice application!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Honest feedback as a DL user for 4 yrs-started Covid year as something productive to do. I've since on&off used it to brush up on my intermediate Spanish/rough beginner French & add new languages not knowing a single word in Italian, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese. Now I know some basics. Love that could do as many as you want! I've used the app on and off as a subscriber when I could afford it- 100% recco saving to pay the yearly sub- worth the add free experience + other options. Truly LOVE DL!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is very good for basic language (in my case French) drills. There's a free version (with adverts), which is good. Duolingo makes me do a few drills every day. The quality of the app updates could be improved since occasionally I install an update that repeatedly crashes. Edit: Feb 2024. I'm still using Duolingo. I shouldn't criticise a free app too much but the ads for games are too long. I'm not interested in games but it makes me watch games ads that seem to go on forever."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have a small background in French, which is definitely helping me out. However, Duo works very well for someone who likes their learning to be highly interactive and repetitive. I plan to pair my studying with Duo with a textbook since I feel like some of the nuance is lost during the lessons and review can be limited, but all the other things Duo does make it a perfect tool to pair with other study methods."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Everything's great except I can't turn the ads down. Not even sure how that's possible honestly. I literally turned my media sound, alarm sound notification sound and call volume down to 0% yet it still played at 100% -_- This happened while my gf was on call and her client heard it since she works from home..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo isn't only about ""memorizing"" phrases as so many language programs focus on. Instead, it uses repetitive methods and inserting reviews constantly in each lesson. It also helps the student understand the ""rules of grammar"" for each language. Have greatly enjoyed this program."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"For the most part it is a good app, but glitches happen. For instance I just earned 280 XP after working for quite a while. My place kept up but then after a while it suddenly dropped me all the way down to a total of 52 XP this week. Very frustrating and no way to report the glitch."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app has improved to be more enjoyable and keeps users more motivated to learn the language. I started using the app back in 2015, I have learned a lot more of the language during this redownload since then. I have been using Duolingo off and on since then. I am more motivated to learn now due to the updates. I do admit that I want to also have the ability to learn the alphabet, punctuations, numbers and a few other starter things when learning the language so that is why I give it a 4 star."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it's pretty amazing for learning the alphabet to your target language. If you're looking for an app to help you learn words, I think duolingo would work best if you're using other apps along with it and flash cards, etc. however I feel like the xp system needs improvement. duo encourages you to make language learning into a competitive game, but this doesn't work very well because it's a distraction from actually paying attention to what you're learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,would like more options to write in Korean rather than clicking ready made textboxes as its not sinking in as much as I'd like. and im recognising patterns rather than learning how to spell the words but in all other respects absolutely loving my time with duolingo. love the way it's like a game. loving all the language options and quizzes. ...would like to learn Igbo but it's not on your selected language list.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have been using Duolingo since 2012 (yes, since it was a closed beta with invites only) and, somehow, for the past few years, it's getting worse a worse. Ads are incredibly annoying and when I paid for 2 YEARS I felt almost not benefits from it other than no Ads and, for such a expensive plan, I see no point. You'll never learn a language with Duolingo, that's a fact and the company knows it, they just want to milk all the casuals. Update: a new 1 star for me. I can't even close the Ads."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,it's good to start but when you reach certain level the progress is veeeeery slow. The are several exercise types that teach nothing and is not configurable to remove them. If I could choose them I'd think about paying. Also they repeat way too much some things
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo was great at first, but with the advent of AI and the likelihood of lessons getting more and more wrong due to mistranslations, I have lost faith in it. I cancelled my Super subscription due to this, and would recommend others do the same to show Duolingo that automation like this is not the way forward."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Stop giving us 6 to 8 xp when it's supposed to provide you 20 to 40 xp. It's super infuriating. There's also some words where you can't even translate without having the proper keyboard for it. Also, some of these courses are way too short and don't even provide the learning that everything comes with the languages, numbers, alphabet, etc... especially when we're paying over $100.00 a month for plus, and we don't even get full access to learn the entire language. Please fix this!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's unbelievable, years later still missing the feature to grab and drag words to reorder them within a sentence. Each time you forget a word which belongs to the beginning of the sentence, you can't simply add the word and drag it where it belongs in the sentence. Somehow this works in the web version but not in the app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app manages to take the addictive reward system of mobile games and put it to use in a productive way. Even when you are at your lowest level of motivation this app scoops you up and helps you to continue learning. By contineously offering you compliments, rewards and reachable goals. But be aware that this isn't a full language course and can't replace it. You dont get taught a rule of grammer directly. You sort of learn it on the side intuitively by translating a lot of sentences."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This was the best app I could've used to learn Spanish. I always thought learning a new language would be extremely hard, but Duo made it way easier than I could've imagined. I started only knowing a couple words and barely 2 days later I'm already able to say full sentences in Spanish. I never thought an owl known for kidnapping families would be so helpful üíÄ"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's a game, pure and simple. Don't plan on being fluent or having a college-level experience -- despite what the ads say, it's not true. It is what it is: a game. There is no customer service, many answers are wrong. In addition, it's not really much of a game. It routinely shorts you points when you complete one of the ""'skill"" levels, and, again, there is no way to contact anyone about this. If it were possible to give a negative rating, this application would have one."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Taken a real downturn since the recent update which changed all the modules. I was instantly thrown into grammar nightmare tests which I hadn't been taught yet. Yes it may be a better up to date module but it has thrown the current users in the dirt. I can't get through a single ""lesson"" (very loose use of word, unless you pay premium you get kicked out the 'class' after you run out of 5 lives, and left not learning anything at all) I really wish I could get the money back I threw into this."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great apl for learning a different language. Do have some options on what you can learn. I don't use the speaking ones. I wish the app would get rid of the spelling ones as those tend to get me messed up. Can't spell when typing regularly, let alone a foreign language. It's not a bad app, though. Change some things and give people more options on exercises they do."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"German, French, Dutch, Portugese really are amazing. -- Duolingo English is truly AWFUL. And I'm not just referring to sidewalks, faucets and duolingo's weird prepositions: I don't think we all want to go around sounding like Homer Simpson! -- 26.1.2024 trite and loud background music appeared making DuoLingo unuseable for a time. -- Immediate rejection of microphone in Android: Please provide a FULL instruction on how to rectify this.

The match madness levels requires extra minutes to complete, whereas the you can just start another lightning round of you have run out of time.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a fantastic language learning app! Its user-friendly interface and interactive lessons make language acquisition enjoyable. The gamified approach keeps you motivated, and the diverse range of languages ensures there's something for everyone. The consistent updates and engaging challenges enhance the overall learning experience. I highly recommend Duolingo for anyone looking to learn a new language in a fun and effective way!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Practice (repetition) is essential to remember words but that's only available with the paid version. Poor structure for teaching grammar, tenses & conjugation. Other than that, you pick it up over time, it does what it says. Paid App is great, free I'd likely drop in time."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellant!! Duolingo (Spanish) works best for my learning style, affordable price & brief segments. Duolingo is fun, interactive speaking, gives specific feedback & targets improvement. Needs additional grammer verb tense hints in side bar notes. I am developing a verb study chart for myself. I look forward to my daily lesson, I am able to absorb like a sponge. Like daily lesson reminders. I speak all of the words on the drills (comprehision & pronunciation.) Great review segments. Love it!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Good business model and a really bad app. Try something else before you advance too far and can't leave it (ie. their business model). Most frustrating app ever. Sooo many bugs and sooo little bug fixing. New! They removed community added content, which helped us learn more than the app itself. I have reported dozens of mistakes in the last 3 years, and they fixed maybe 3."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hey guys, I think this app is great and also with some weird stuff, but the case is that I've already ended my course yesterday and it doesn't looks like it has an end, should I play and compete in this game eternally? I don't think so, it's a little bit unpractical, beside it took me 5gb of storage to do it, I don't have storage enough to play to the end of times; it could be better, like all normal game that come to an real end, however nice if you need to learn and don't have another option."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's been 772 days of me learning French It is a great app for learning and introducing yourself to the new genres It sometimes sucks bcoz of the limited heart options but in a month or two after practicing I get super Duo as a reward which is like adding cherry to the cake , mail is sent every week for the PRs and check efficiency levels Super it makes it easier to pass lessons and units quickly but one disadvantage which I faced was something inexplicable exceeded word limit so can't write"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They've made the base game so annoying, with ads and only give you a few attempts at failing before stopping you from playing entirely. Only Duo Super is worth it and you have to pay monthly (another thing to add to your bills) It doesn't even teach you properly to warrant another bill. Purposefully making it difficult and annoying to use so you pay them. Should be illegal"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app, I've been using it since November 2022 and I've started courses in Spanish and japanese! They teach you sentences and other things that you'd actually use in real life. I've been able to impress family and friends with my skills and it's just plain fun!¬°Te quiero duo!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app takes full advantage of gamification to urge you on in language learning. It covers reading, writing, listening, and speaking. It also helps you figure out vocabulary and grammar in a natural way. This is a great app for starting a new language. Definitely worth the reasonable cost for the upgrade if you are serious about learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I updated the app and boom all of a sudden I'm always ""offline"", I've tried restarting my phone, logging out, deleting and downloading the app again, I even tried opening a new account, but to no avail. Nothing is working and now I've lost my 100 day streak. I even tried using a VPN but still nothing. I've never been so frustrated with an like this before."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's a great app to learn other languages. But I hate that you have a certain amount of tries on your lessons. How did they expect us to learn the words if we don't have enough time to learn it because of our mistakes. I don't like that it's my mistakes and then you're out. I understand that you can use gems or you can go back to a lesson and redo it for more hearts. But why is there even hard if this is a learning app. It's not like some sort of game that it's like five shots and then your out.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Pretty much stopped using it after the introduction of new Spanish stories and replacing the old ones, which were fun and exciting. The new UI is fine to me, I don't really care about it 2/5 Edit: they bring some of the old cool stories which is nice, however characters have changed voices, still a lot of stories is missing, also stories with multiple parts are missing 3/5"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Everything in this app is good for learning languages. But one of the worst thing i saw while learning korean. That the guide book is not well designed. Now i am in the unit 3 lesson 1. In this unit i saw a bunch of new words. But the words are not written in the guide book. I wish you will fix this for every units if they have this problem. Another one is the audio. Some audios are not clear and accurate as well as they should. I will update my review once all this issues are fixed.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"5 stars for the old app 3 stars for the updated version. The new update seems to be geared at getting more plus members. Penalizing mistakes by deducting hearts is pointless‚Äîit makes us *fear* making mistakes and that completely defeats the purpose of learning a new language! And the ads? I get you're trying to advertise Duolingo plus, but we don't need to see the same ad after every lesson to get the point. (I've been using Duolingo for over 2 years and so far it has helped me a lot)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've made several attempts to learn French, but unfortunately, none of them were successful. However, I genuinely appreciate Duolingo for its efforts in helping me along the way. Remember, language learning can be challenging, but persistence and the right tools make a difference! üòä"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The gameplay is great! Easy, quick lessons. However, I can't change my language or practice to get more hearts!! Why Duolingo!!!!!! This seems to only be available on Apple. Are you serious D:!!!! To top it off, I CAN'T EVER REPORT ANY BUGS!!!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is definitely one of the best ways to learn a language, because it works on a very specific learning aproach when it never stops challenging you. The opportunity to advance through the leagues is the best side of this app, because it doesn't only teach you a language. It keeps you entertrained and motivated to earn xp as well, which makes this app stand out above the other ways of learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I gladly gave this application five stars. I've been using it for more than seven years to learn Spanish. It is continually improving as my language skills also improve. One can help save endangered languages such as Navaho if you want to. It offers an incredible number of languages; unbelievably, even some fictional ones like Klingon! Why waste phone time on useless games when you can learn language(s)? If you try this application, I don't think that you'll regret it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a good app for learning a language. It uses gamification which makes the leaning process fun. It does not teaches any grammar or rules. You just learn from many examples. This is the same learning process that is used by babies to learn their mother's tongue. My main issue with this app is that many times the translation to English I enter in response to a challenge correctly capture the meaning of foreign language sentence, yet Duolingo rate it as wrong since the English is ""wrong"""
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Adverts are louder than lessons. This continuously has me put the app down for months at a time. Not renewing contracts of employees is as good as firing them. Getting rid of your translation teams so you can use ""AI"" instead is disgusting. Machines don't understand very important aspects of human speech, like contextual words or inflection for example. Shame on you, Duolingo higher-ups. Shame on you and your greed."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo helped me a lot with learning basic Greek vocabularies and grammars. I just started learning Greek and it made me already confident in learning it! I personally think that Duolingo is an app for beginners. It gives you confidence and keeps you motivated. So, if you are trying to learn a language, try out Duolingo, it worked for me. Thanks Duo ü¶â !!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I personally like dualingo because of the learning experience you get and the way they teach you is amazing. For instance there is:hearing the words,matching the words,writing the words and picking the spelling of the words.Also I can't forget that they give you so many options for different languages! I think everyone who wants to learn different languages should download dualingo now! I also rated dualingo a 5 starü§óFor Greta service too!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Fantastic so far. Better than the other apps that either go too fast or present the information in a flash card type way. I am using the free version. The ads are reasonable. The heart system makes sense, every error costs a heart, and if you run out of hearts you have to practice to earn more. The only improvement I would want to see is that when you are practicing to earn more hearts you practice some material from the current lesson you are struggling with."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"very good app. I've been learning German for a long time now, and I'm getting very good at it. this app has a lot of good features, and it mainly teaches you conversational skills, rather than starting from the ground up. this app can teach you helpful conversational skills, and if you have the widget it will remind you whenever you look at it if you need to practice."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"So far, it's good. I would like more grammar focus. I was horrible with grammar in school but still would like to learn a foreign language. Also, have an option for switching out unused nouns/words for ones I personally will frequently use. Like, I won't use Mexican, England, Japan, school, study, student, university... I'd like to replace those with words I'd be more likely to use like Canada, American, Germany, vacation, visit, travel, shop... Please, create options for tailored lessons."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is fun while learning English better everyday. Every level is fun to engage with. They are generous as well to use the app without paying high costs. Of course, every app asks you to subscribe but it's up to you if you will. But if they're giving you free trial sometimes, be grateful to that at least. I can still play even if I'm not using premium. That's why thank you for the founders and technical team who created this app! More power to you Duolingo team!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"With the most recent application updates and the lack of premium, I have been exposed to the fact that after every lesson (roughly 30‚Äî70 seconds for me) that I'm inundated with an advertisement for completing my lesson which cuts into my learning time because the advertisements are just as long as the lessons. I still will use the application for now, but when nearly more than 50% of my time is spent watching advertisements for excelling in the lessons it feels like a punishment."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app's mascot is already like one of my idols. But other than that, the app is amazing, I like the new format and it's super easy to use. Yes you may have only 5 lives, but once you start learning the language not many mistakes are made. Plus, they offer 3 days of free super Duolingo occasionally which is a great boost."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Getting worse and worse, more ""game-ified"" with every update. Removed commenting on questions which was very helpful input from the community, questions are not checked properly, everything is American English specific, even where British English translation bares a lot more similarity to the other language and would be more helpful, and frequently you get jumped forward along the ""path"" because of an update, leading to missed lessons and errors. The new layout is way too restrictive as well"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A very motivating app with many different kinds of experience. Duolingo trains speaking, hearing, writing and more. These different experiences help you learn the language faster. There are also many unique languages available but you need to learn some in English wich is not important to native speakers but to people who are learning English and another language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The reason I'm giving 5/5 is not because it's so good it can be used as a main tool for language learning, but rather because I'm evaluating it from another point of view. As an additional tool - it is really great. It's bright, catchy, very interactive, competitive and engaging. You can't expect it to teach you everything, however it can be a great tool to enhance vocabulary, some grammar andpronunciation, not to mention you it allows you to see if you are ready to commit to a language :)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to be a decent supplemental app for the classes I've been taking but since they started relying more heavily on AI, I often see the exact same sentences multiple times in one lesson, the translations don't always make sense anymore, and the overall quality of the lessons has significantly decreased. Disappointing."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like how Duolingo lets you learn languages in a fun and often engaging way, especially with the leaderboards giving a competition. Personally, I would put in a language comparison feature for people who are learning multiple languages with the app to compare words that mean the same thing in the Native Language, and the other languages learnt by the app. Kind of similar to the ipad and computer versions, but with more features and word specification. Other than that, I think it's great."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I think it's bad that you don't have the option to learn British English. And I'm also becoming discouraged from using it because I need to spend a lot of money to be among the top 3 and stay in that position. These two points are making me stop using. The competitions stimulated me but I don't think it's right to spend so much money even paying for the most expensive subscription. offensives end up being very expensive. I think it's sad, I like the design and methodology."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"You are amazinggg. Yeah. Eres asombrosoo!!!! Your concept of the streak have kept me hooked to this app. Its helping me use my time so much better. Im having so much fun and learning alott a the same time. And the rewards you give after each lesson are just amazing. The coding, the game like structure and the notifications, the casualness and user friendliness of duolingo is just amazing. It has changed my life."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Taking into account that it is a free app with minimum ads it is absolutely fantastic. It provides a fun way to do a bit of language between stuff but obviously you ain't gonna speak the language fluently just by doing it. It is a wonderful side gig though! Very user gamey, user friendly, bright, colourful, engaging, etc. Great job!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Harder to review things once you have passed the lessons. I'm learning japanese mostly now and because Kanji only get used every so often you learn the pronunciation over the actual characters. This might be intentional but when you see the same word many many many times it can get monotous. I'd rather they challenge me a bit more then bring previous words to remind me every so often as it's easy to forget the definition of a word in another language.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The efficiency of learning words decreased tragically. With this new stile and linear learning line I don't have the choice anymore if I want to continue with another lecture. When I start a new lecture the picture-word connection is always the last ant the lecture need from me tu understand the new word immediately from writing. Please bring back the old app, or give me the possibility to downgrade this app, because I don't like the new stile and lecture organization."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm doing the Irish course, and much of the pronunciations do not match what I learned in school. Also, I think a good proportion of the sentences aren't well structured and are, in many cases, not what actual Irish speakers or even English speakers would ever be likely to say. The app is almost just a game for me now, and if I really wanted to learn a language or become fluent, I would use something else."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It was going great at first. I was learning Japanese. I made it to Unit 2 and that's when the problem started. A type of question where I had to fill in a dialogue box appeared and it would not allow me to proceed even though my answer was clearly correct. It would only allow me to proceed with the incorrect answer. I lost all of my hearts because of this glitch. I believe it was a tactic so I could be forced to purchase the version with unlimited hearts since I was using the free version.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Way too many intrusive animations that waste time. Even though in settings, I have disabled animations, they keep adding new ones. I am not interested in cartoons. Please, please let me have a way to disable these and get back to learning. So frustrating."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I enjoyed my time with Duo and found the app fun and helpful, but recently after Duolingo laid off some of its translators and began to transition to using AI, I've noticed a decrease in quality of the lessons. I'll miss it, but I want to learn languages correctly. This was a great starting point on my language learning journey, and I'm sad to see it decline."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a fun way to learn language. It's very much like a game and they have mastered the art of using psychological tricks to get you to practice longer. However, it never really teaches language in a traditional sense. It just tests you on knowledge and shows you what is right and wrong. There are no lessons, per se. Therefore, it never really tells you WHY something is done a certain way - it just corrects you if you do it wrong."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app and it has an impressive amount of languages to learn from. My only complaint is the amount of translation they make you do without an option to deactivate translation exercises. They also don't give you much cultural information. It's not the best way to learn a language, but it is a great addition to the learning process - and it's somewhat fun."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo has been really helpful with learning Spanish. All the other apps seem more confusing, but Duolingo is an owl. so like... But it's also really fun, there's different leagues, and it's just been a big help. And before I saw Duolingo it was very difficult trying to find an app to learn Spanish easy, till I found Duolingo! Thank you so much for whoever made this app, it's very helpful."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I recommend Duolingo for language learning. However, after looking at one other review, I realized that you never gave me an insight into the grammar of Vietnamese, which is annoying because there are 2 Vietnamese words meaning ""to learn"" and you never provide me with which word to use when I click the underlined words for assistance. Overall, a good app only if you can satisfy grammar specification."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really like duolingo, but I am starting to think that maybe it won't teach me the whole language, because you don't really progress much, you only learn about 200 words in your first section. One thing, also the stories don't really teach you anything, so I don't know why they put it into duolingo in the first place. Don't get me wrong it's great. But I think it could do with a tiny bit more improvement. Also once you start a course there is no going back, I accedentally chose Welsh."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app! Pace is not too difficult for me to quit, but also not too easy to learn anything. Using Duolingo, I have made great progress in my Russian (language I learned 30 years ago), and in Italian (I'm learning it for the first. Free version is not overloaded with advertising, and I use it without in-app purchases. In fact, I am so satisfied with the way it works, that I will start paying a membership fee next month - simply to show gratitude to Duolingo team, for the great work they do!"

Your stupid course insists it is the hospital is to the left side of the restaurant ignoring grammar. It is bothering me and stopping my progress. Remove it or explain this . Otherwise your course is worthless except hanzi writting. How may I trust the quality of your course , when I know for sure something is wrong, and you never fix it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's awesome üòéüëç but like everyone else I face the same problem. After updating the app it has become slower and lags but it's legendary app #12yrold Duoelite.I hope that you add new types of interesting sections in the app. And also the highlights of this app are that it contains no ads thanks for that and it is a great learning app for kids and adults alike and for free of course.I learnt languages so fast with no difficulty.Best language and vocabulary building app in the WORLD üåéüåçüáÆüá≥ü§©ü•≥
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's okay. The pronunciation for some languages are incorrect. And sometimes completing a lesson to above 95% does not contribute to your streak, which is stupid, especially if you don't have Super Duolingo. Also, the ""Free 2 Week Trial"" needs a credit card to use, why?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I took Spanish in High School. This is a great way to refresh what I remember and finally get it down! I have already practiced with some of my spanish-speaking friends! I am frustrated with having to un-install and re-install the app every couple of weeks. Update: now it seems like I have to un-install and re-install every day! This has become very frustrating!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app to learn new languages on! Has many motivational fetures that keep you going! One thing I noticed that isn't quite what I wanted is that they don't actually teach you what endings apply to what sircumstances for romance languages (or i just haven't gotten there yet), so you have to pay extra attention to the patterns of when and where they use specific endings."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to really like it. Quality went down, discovered the Irish on there is largely bunk, and just now found out that they're utilizing AI to do the translations in place of actual professionals. Unless your plans to travel land you no farther than your office chair, and your goals to communicate end at having a discussion with google translate, I'd recommend other paths."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It doesn't really teach you grammar. I'm trying to learn German, for example, and keep losing hearts because I don't know which nouns are masculine and which are feminine. Duolingo touches on this briefly in the first lesson you learn, but they never teach you how to distinguish between masculine and feminine words for yourself. This makes it a guessing game of whether you need to use der, die, das, ein ,eine, etc. It's quite frustrating. It is good for extending your vocabulary, though."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"After finishing the course the every day learning becomes too repetitive. Always the same lessons and vocabulary. It would be a great chance to reinforce vocabulary and situations, but it is always the same lessons."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I ACTUALLY LOVE DUOLINGO. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE TERRIFYING. 1. The tutorial is great. I love how you can also practice, not only do lessons. 2. Also, I like when you're online, you can refill your hearts repeatedly by just doing multiple practice sessions at a time. 3. I am, so seriously, IN LOVE WITH THE AVATAR CHOICES. They fit the vibe given to Duolingo and I think they are adorable. 4. I like what you can do in the lessons like: Trace letters, listening, Etc. I love this game. 5/5 stars Yay!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Really cool as first, then you realize you need the premium version to really use the app to its fullest. Then you buy it and get into it then it gets really repetitive and doesn't focus on words you struggle with and continuously asks you words you know, occasionally having a word you struggle with."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,absolutely love the app! great for all aspects of learning a language and you can start at any level. the revards sytem is amazing also earning points and badges. As well as battling your friends and quests to compleate. is almost the perfect app. i find it difficult the matching words because once you match the words the new that appear are kind of having a lag begor ethey appear and thus hard to overcome the time count.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The learning capabilites are absolutely wonderful for this site, I've learned a good bit of Japanese within a few days but you guys are really pushing the ads, the duolingo super is allways In my face, the fact I have to pay a monthly subscription to learn a language at a fast pace, and I get it, like supporting a whole app with little to no income, but make it not in my face so much, I see the super ad's more than actual ads. Over great site, would not reccomend"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"For a free language learning app, it is definitely very educational. However, as someone who reads about the language I'm learning from other sources, I feel that this should offer explanations for sentence structure, character use, and other things that are involved in the language. They simply teach you words and uses of the words (not all of them, though), even if you pay for the premium plan. There should also be a more in-depth analysis for the language in general. But overall, it's great!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Everything good. But when I complete a course it glitches out and doesn't load, forcing me to close the app and reopening it and having to go through the lesson again. When pressing on the Duolingo notification, it sends me to Duolingo but it doesn't load. And finally sometimes I just open the app and it doesn't load. Forcing me to restart my device for it to work, only for the lesson to glitch out and not save, leaving now loading screen when I am done with a lesson..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have had this app for over 2 years and have learned a lot but lately there has been a lot of updates which have caused a lot of glitching and has also caused me to not reap the benefits that I usually get from practice. For instance, I literally just tried to do my daily lessons and was not rewarded when it said I was supposed to. My time is wasted because the app freezes on constantly & I do not recommend downloading this app. It is terrible and it's a far cry from what it used to be."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I can learn Irish anytime, anywhere for as little or as long as I want. It teaches me how to read it, say it, hear it, and surprisingly WRITE it too! There's no timer, so I can go as fast or as slow as I need to. I can go back to previous lessons and do ""practice"" lessons to earn more hearts. I get to share my progress on Facebook. It's a really cool app. I'm glad I chose to download it. I might end up subscribing. We'll see."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It is very ANNOYING & FRUSTRATING when trying to speak Spanish on this App as the language speaker constantly speaks over you when you are speaking !!!@#¬£%., Plus when speaking, the App is either locking up or the App cannot hear your speech !!!##%& This makes the whole process very stressful !!!!!, whereas it should be an enjoyable experience. This needs to be sorted out."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Started Learning Arabic on this and this is perhaps the best tool I've found to memorise letters as a beginner. The quizzes are a gamified memory trainer. You inadvertently end up remembering the letters and their shapes as you go along. You can alternatively use that to study too by noticing certain letter combinations and the sounds they produce. All in all, the techniques used in this app cater to how your brain learns. You'll be surprised by how much you've learned by the end of a quiz."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This program is really great for reviewing or learning a language, particularly if you already speak a similar one of have some recollection from high school. For example, I think I would struggle with the way they present French verbs if I only new English, but they are easy to pick up with limited introduction since I speak Spanish and some Portuguese."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app, but alone I couldn't fully speak the language. I would use Duolingo and learn how to order something, but also need a bit more help outside the app not need English subtitles. My Italian is going well and this Duo teaches me faster than my school does. So good job, and maybe add more complex sentences to work with like ""I'm so tired of this stupid math work. Let me call my bestie."" So we can use them irl lol. 9/10"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good language learning gamified app. Animations should be configurable (on/off). Chinese course should display most common English translation instead of appraisal. Thanks DuoLingo for updating courses. Unfortunately Chinese almost gets no upgrades. Some phrases are translated or spoken wrongly (e.g. Á≤• not Huang). Microphone does not work anymore, in any config. Duolingo claims it is not about competing, but is totally structured and incentivises on competition, learning becomes stressful !"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It was great until you removed the previous feature and replaced it with match madness. It's no fun at all! I'd have rated it 5 stars until we have an option to choose between match madness and the previous feature, I'll hold onto my rating.

If it's a learning app, why keep you from studying with this limited heart system? Those things make the app very counterproductive, because to much time is spent in the repetitive lessons and wasted in 30 seconds ads every two minutes. Also, it is unnecessary woke. I just wanted to study without being hit by woke propaganda inside the lessons."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I did Japanese for three years in school, I've picked up Duolingo now to stay sharp on all those things I learnt. While it isn't taught in the same order, I can see myself remembering more vocabulary words than I ever did in school, I highly recommend. A suggestion for Duolingo, I know it's a bit different to spoken language but I can't find any apps on Australian Sign Language which I found helpful, adding it to your list would be an untapped market and greatly appreciated."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Update: I used this app daily for almost two years and made a lot of progress but after the last update no matter how much progress I make the next day it kicks me back to a previous level. I have done the same lessons over again for over a week. If the next update doesn't fix it I will stop using this app. Too bad because I really liked it when it worked I love this app! I have made so much progress in just 15-30 minutes a day!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Very useful. I already knew many words in Spanish yet I was unsure of the proper sentence structure in wich to use them making me sound like I was retarded to Mexicans when I tried to communicate with them. Your app has helped tremendously in just two days. Even after just two lessons my Mexican friends noticed a huge improvement in my sentence structure. Thank you so much!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"App itself, technically speaking, is perfect, everything is well thought of. However, content which is the most important thing leaves a lot to be desired... For example, Korean class is not very good. Legendary level covers new words and phrases which are not included in regular practice. Regular practice is just repetition without many new sentences. Fine, if that's the concept, but what about the new words? Also, too many different sentences in just one go. I cannot memorize all of that."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely amazing. I cannot believe that this app has a YouTube channel. There was a bug that I found that even with animations turned on, the animations are stuck but still intractable. Please fix this bug so I can still be satisfied of how smooth your animation is. Thank you, Duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The last year Duolingo seems to have less choices in courses and more weird grammar/answers that it says are wrong but match the translation it asks for. Feel like it's become a waste of time. For all the time I've spent on it I have little to show besides a 800 day streak. Now that they seem to be leaning into using AI to make things I'm worried about how much of the little I'm learning is actually correct. And how much is a poor google translation.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Hindi was a difficult subject for me. But duolingo gifted me confidence and easy way to learn hindi in enjoyable manner. I am truthfully saying that i really loves your app. 5 stars and grade-A is not over for your app. Not only me, every medias and every people have good immerse on this app. This app is a boon from god for us people. We feel lucky to study different languages in a very beautiful manner. Now i stopped playing games and started concentrating on learning hindi. Thank you dualingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very good at motivating one to continue & for learning vocabulary and basic sentence structure. It has almost a game format. I would lhowever like more continuity of sentences, eg some conversation; questions asked are rarely answered in the next sentence."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Nice app. UPDATE: Most recent update has a problem with tap to speak - after tapping and speaking there is an extremely long pause and it may go to try again but within seconds changes to accepting it. This did not occur before. Restarting yhe phone does not help.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's been pretty good at building a basic vocabulary, but you don't learn how the grammar works, so you have to figure out patterns yourself. It oddly teaches a lot of reading and listening but tests a lot on writing which is super frustrating. It's a fun app but I'm pretty doubtful you'd become conversational in a language using only Duolingo. Whether it's for you will be a lot to do with your goals."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This really helps me get motivated with everything. The freaking notifications are f****** hilarious. I love this app. It really helps me get motivated during the day if I start getting motivated then. I would get motivated to do other stuffand this makes me very happy. I'm very happy that this app exist. And I want it to keep producting and keep adding on to how grad it already is. But there is a bit of a problem with the ADS for me. It's just a little bit too much. Other than that this is nice
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a great accessible language resource. However, I would only use this app for languages that use the Roman alphabet. Currently, there is no way to turn off transliterations and there are apps that work better for non-roman alphabets. For example, I use other apps for learning Korean (lingodeer), Arabic (mango languages/pimsler), and Bangla (bluebird/mondly)."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The lessons are good but the app has bugs in either its design or implementation.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"- Very well though through, nice to use. Many addictive mechanics used to make you continue (xp, league, legendary chest, gem systems) - waste of time, waaaaay too many repetitive basic sentences all the way to the end. - I'd love more theory before practice (approx none currently). - The free version is unusable: excessive 'gem', 'heart' dependency, frequent ads... - A few bugs, especially on a spotty connection (eg. lags on lesson validation, or even crash and lesson not marked as done)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is too focused on XP and speed at which you can take lessons, not on the number of lessons, the number of new words, not the proficiency in vocabulary. It's all about SPEED at the number of lessons you can finish. I won't renew my annual."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Single lesson takes up to 2-3 minutes to finish. After that: an ad. After every single activity: up to 2 ads. Besides that, irritating popups and ""gamifications"". This can be solved with premium that costs $7 a month. Judge for yourself if it's worth it. Duolingo is grate in browser but the app is a blatant cash grab. Edit: I heard you had laid off huge chunk of your stuff to replace them with AI. Well generate yourself an AI client then bc i won't use that ad infested app ever again. Greed."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is still pretty good but last time I logged in they were not advertasing there premium plan that much. But when desided to continue learning, I realised that they were asking me to upgrade to a premium version after every single practise, and besides then, when I open the app the first thing I see is ""Upgrade your plan to premium"". Now, I have no doubt that they are going to start making premium plans. Duolingo is getting worse."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is the app I mostly rely on for learning languages but the problem is not all the languages are there that I really want to learn and also why can't Android get the new updates and features 2nd after IPhone and IPad. and another problem is my memory sucks so I have to review lessons again and again and again. Overall An AMAZING APP Asante (Swahili) Merci (Thanks) Duolingo
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It would be better if the introduction of new word meanings wasn't done in a multiple choice style question. I don't know the language and I'm only being given a 25% chance to get it right. Statistically im only going to be able to learn 6 words before i used up my daily fails. Even with another romantic language in my arsenal there are differences that you have to just guess at. I've lost motivation to participate in an app that punishes you for not knowing something you're trying to learn.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,horrible push to upgrade with adds shown at a ridiculous pace. i understand the need tobpay for the servuce but it beats you over the head relentlessly. the premium cost is stuoidly high as well. its to the point youd make a better investment going with a productblike pimmsleur. i enjoy the language models here but we need more back to back repitition of specific words phrases before moving to another. it makes retention very difficult.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Been using Duolingo for 2 years. Only once you get to the unit where it starts teaching how to communicate with natives, do things start to line up with typical language education & it takes too long to get there. I've taken many language classes in college. My only complaint is that it doesn't teach you how to say things the way people actually talk. The sentences that it has you learning are things that you would never hear anybody say, so it's unrealistic.Other than that its ü™ô for being free"

Today is my 9th day, & I am totally shocked at how much German I can understand & comprehend already, & being able to speak small phrases is absolutely amazing! I love to practice 1-3 hours per day :)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing for anyone to learn the language they desire but the thing is the older version was better than this where the topics were divided into 6 levels or so and each level had a crown.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great for learning, but not enough explanation or types of learning for less common languages.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This review is specifically due to the last update for the Japanese language course, the last update from 22/03 is horrible: 1) killed all the progress on key Kanji characters relevant for the Genki boom 1 (and, therefore for N5 JLPT), made the Kanji training idiotically simple and boring 2) killed thematic progress on more advanced topics revering to ""I'm German"" sentences or similar. 3) Mistakes and errors in translation, loss of progression feeling.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The update to the Italian course seems good for someone starting out as the phrases being learnt seem more useful from the start but it messed up my progress so now it says words are new that I've known for ages but doesn't say other words are new that I've never seen even after reading books and watching shows. I'm also no longer seeing one tense but have been thrown into another. There's always been an issue with teaching rules which was helped by the comment section but that was removed?
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I find the order that you learn things in very random. For example I can tell you I have a meeting at 11 in Italian but I haven't learned the numbers 1-12! Same with days and months. Also as I speak English UK not US English some of the translations don't match up as it uses American vocab (sidewalk, movie theatre etc). I wouldn't rely on this for conversation but it's helpful when supplemented with other online programs (try the coffee break Italian for helpful every day phrases)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I study Dutch on Duolingo. The pronouns ze and zij mean the same thing, I can use either one, but the app always says I'm wrong, it's never right, I've tried every way, using one for plural and another for singular, inverting, and always the app says it's wrong.I've already taken Dutch classes at school and I know it's right, but for the app I'm always wrong. It is very unpleasant and tiring to be corrected without being wrong. I've reported it thousands of times, but it doesn't get better."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is the greatest language learning app but im here to point 2 cons out. 1. The animation stops working after some times, going in the setting and toggling the animation button on/off doesn't do anything, the only way to fix it is delete and reinstall the app. 2. In rapid mode where you need to complete the questions in short time i accidentally pressed buy 5 timer boosts for 1800 gems (it appears in the continue button) and because theres no ""are you sure"" i bought it!üôÇüî´My month savings.."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"not as good after removing the ability to comment and ask questions on the app and have them answered by real people. most content is now ai- generated which is technically correct but not necessarily how a native speaker would say it. bringing back human interaction would improve the score. good for vocabulary currently but trying to ""gamify"" language learning a bit too much."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a very good app for learning languages. But, there are so many things you have to pay money for. It definitely would have gotten 5 if you didn't have to pay for SO MUCH. Also, there definitely are some significantly better apps for learning languages. Those other apps wouldn't cost money. But for some things I like about this app are that you get streaks and when you get a high streak (I have a 44 day streak) you feel like you have to do another lesson to continue your streak! That's It!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is good. I understand arabic way more better than before but one thing that i wanna complain about is how the Ai voice that's teaching me(or whatever), keeps disappearing and at first i thought my phone was lagging, but it isn't my phone it is Duolingo.. and also my screen keeps freezing/blacking out after or whenever i finish a lesson. I really hope duolingo sees this and updates the app, im frustrated and sad:(."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"*Update - 18 Feb 2024: PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix the stupid bug that is causing the app to not detect voice properly. This issue started since 2 updates ago. I had to change my review because like many others, I learned a lot in the beginning, but the app suddenly updates and changes the course material in the midst of a lesson. The hints aren't as accurate as they used to be, so phrasing the context of a sentence becomes more difficult. Lithuanian is also not offered in this app, why?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I just started a few days ago and I am 45 and struggle with memory issues, but for some odd reason or another, I seem to be able to retain the information I am receiving from this app. It's fun and easy to understand, and remember so that it sinks into your head. I love it. If looking to learn a new language quickly...download now and stick with it as much as humanly possible."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I like it, however, it needs a lot of work. It doesn't tell you the gender rules, the guidebook only gives you tips that only cover 10% of the unit, and it is not free learner friendly. Because it'll tell you to ""listen for the missing word,"" and both answers will sound exactly the same. You're bound to get it wrong, and you won't be able to learn properly without paying for the premium"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"If you're inclined to be addicted to competitive games, then this is it. So it's been frustrating when lately it's been a bit ""buggy"" and I've lost my opportunity to gain double points. I'd have to spend hours literally to get to the top of the league, but not sure if my ability to speak the language has improved. I need to get over my addiction, just enjoy the language learning, and look for friends to talk to."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Update: for over a month now, half the ads freeze. Have to close the app & start over. Very frustrating, need attention. ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Helpful but a bit broken. It drops whole days when I *know* I've done the day's lesson, setting me back & using up freezes to artificially maintain continuity. That being said, I am learning, which is the point. But it's frustrating when every few days the app is like ""Nah, you're imagining things; you didn't do yesterday's lesson,"" and you KNOW you did."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Enjoyable learning experience. Worst part is completing a lesson earlier in the day is not counted if you start a lesson from a reminder notification later in the day. So, there is only a record of one lesson completed, not two. Has happened many times now, so getting super frustrating. Ads annoying but tolerable. Would be great if they added the Maori language."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love the app, found more time to learn so I jumped back on. I wish that every xp boost had an option to collect in shop, and that there weren't so many, because most of the time I don't want to practice for 30 minutes, and sometimes I do. I can't stand when I get one and I feel obligated to have to learn so that it doesn't go to waste"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is excellent platform if wish to understand the language however I do if it lags behind when it came to speak or developing control over the language . I have been learning Italian and I some time get confused between using the correct depending upon the word whether the word is masculine or feminine so I believe duo could get a five star if it add grammar or give explain of the user do mistake in grammar. other wise duo is excellent is cartoon animation is quite appealing
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've now finished all 3 sections of Haitian Krey√≤l and am on the refresher section. I've learned about 600 words total. It is the same few sentences ad nauseum! I just use predictive text to complete the typed ones. When I do a Legendary level that incorporates some of the other material, I find I can't remember it because it's not being reviewed. Duolingo has mass fired translators and is now AI generated. There are SO MANY mistakes. Duolingo uses us as beta testers to catch these mistakes."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is good for learning a language, but only if you also spend your time watching shows, reading books, and listening to music in that language. It is recommended that you do this anyway, but the speed you learn the language will be faster without wasting your time on an app that priorities money over base knowledge."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It provides my child a good way to learn a new language and may depends on the job but she may get more money could be a interpreter and more but manly she is learning it to get ready for a chip to Germany for her moms parents! It also provides a fun way to learn as it is set up in a game level type of game. She loves it and uses it everyday even for fun sometimes and she doesn't even like to lean anyway!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Rated 1 due to a revolting advert I keep getting for a hunting game. The 'game' uses real life footage of Coyotes being shot, some of them more than once before dying, one of them yelping pain. I've no issues with games about hunting, but showing actual animals being killed in an advert on a family friendly educational app is abhorrent, sickening and downright evil. I have to see the same animal being shot over and over as the skip button only appears after a certain time span. Disgusting!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is not bad overall, but the timed challenges are designed to make you purchase time boosters. I already pay for duolingo super yet I can't enjoy completing my lessons to 100% without paying extra. I'm generally a fast typer, and I barely ever hesitate in the timed challenges, yet it always feels like I barely make it or am missing 10 sec. Also, in tap pairs challenge, i tap faster than the new words can spawn, yet I run out of time. Until it's fixed, 1 star remains"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is an amazing app to help you learn a language. It has practice exercises based on listening, speaking, and word selection. Its really easy to follow the path just 3 to 20 min a day, and you will see the progress when you have to speak with some one or see a movie in the new language, you'll get amazed by what you have learned."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app will provide you with a very efficient and organized path of learning (at least in german). there is one simple thing though, for languages that use the Latin alphabet it never gives you a clear lesson of how to pronounce their words; you got to learn it in between of your lessons and practices witch is very confusing! Still, defenitly worth a try!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to be made using actual translators but they've switched to using almost exclusively ai, you might as well just use Google translate. They've also gotten rid of the ability to flag a translation and forums where you could ask for help or clarification. I've used Duolingo premium for years and I've already noticed a significant decline Why would I bother trying to learn a language from ai proven to be inaccurate? I'll be cancelling my subscription and switching to Busuu"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It started out good. Unfortunately, over the past year or so every update somehow makes the app worse and worse. It started with the old tree being replaced by the new path, which also made stories unavailable until you get to a certain point. I don't even remember all the updates, I just remember I hated them all. The most recent was the update on the achievements, I'm not sure why people actually like this one. The biggest issue is that they don't care one bit about feedback."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Excellent experience. I'm learning Russian and it ""was"" going good. But now ever since Unit 3 and the end of Unit 2 it has been spitting out billions of new words and putting them in hard combinations. It's good practice but now I have a lack of motivation because of it. Before I was 10-15 minutes per day. Now I am 5 minutes per day. Beside that it is perfect üëå."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app for learning languages. They try to make it addictive though and some lessons are so inappropriate; homosexuality and a 5-year-old boy writing love letters to an older girl... they try to make it funny but it isn't. Several scenarios are more accurate, traditional, morally balanced, and funny. No need to stuff things like this down people's throats. Just be careful with it if your kids are going to come on here... It does introduce you to a new language, so well done."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"gamified language learning to make learning languages less onerous. it's obsession over daily practice gets a little annoying (especially when you're a busy adult), but streak freezes ease that somewhat. I think the $70 annual membership to avoid ads is worth it. It's a nice alternative to learn something rather than doom-scrolling Facebook."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The gamification is really good, it has helped me form a habit. However the difficulty can suddenly jump, I wish it were more smooth. Also, they do not explain everything. It could do more to break down sentence structure, for example, and sometimes it does not highlight the new words."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I truly love Duolingo.It has helped me & has encouraged me to learn new words in a language every day. slowly but surely I've actually learnt a lot & it is an amazing app if you want to travel to a foreign country with a language you don't know. I love this app and I truly recommend it to others
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Note; I am using the app to brush up on my german. It has the frustrating tendency to prefer english loanwords over the german synonyms/original words. But far worse is the Dutch, my native language, seems to have never been checked by a human being. It frequently uses sentences that are grammatically correct but make no sense. Or uses words the way google translate does; it takes words that are in the dictionary, but not used in the way the app represents them. Ok for learning a few words"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Super cool way to learn a new language. (Update 2024) I honestly dislike the guilt trip notifications. It was funny at first, but I seriously avoided the app for a long period of time because of it. I paid for a year, thinking I'd go for another year but have changed my mind. Another thing is that some of the characters in the app are gay. Which is fine, but it's pushed everywhere on the news, on social media, in movies, and in government. I can't even escape it in a language app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app, duo helped me a lot in learning. I just wanted to point to some improvements. 1. It would be great if we could have a test to easily get through the Alphabets. Japanese for example, it takes too much to complete. 2. Adding more languages, I've always wanted Farsi to be added. 3. Easier way to gain XP, I don't know how people get like 6k XP in a couple days. I can barely get 1k daily with so many double XP potions.. If we could buy double XP with a weekly limit or sth, It'll help a lot"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"was going great for a while but after about 120 days in, my courses were altered and I was hit with a bunch of words I didn't actually learn. i don't see why y'all can't update the courses AND offer a means to catch up on new material in ""finished"" courses. put a huge rut in my momentum. also boo ai , will not be resubscribing"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This is a great tool for learning a language, but (1) there are far too many ads (2) after the most recent update, it takes a long time to load up a lesson (3) not all languages have the same level of depth (eg, Greek has less than Spanish), and not all languages are available to non English speakers (eg, you can't learn French from Greek or vice versa). Having used it for over a year, I would say it's worse than it was a year ago - more ads, more bits to do (daily and weekly tasks take up time)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"duolingo is okay if you just think of it as a game to play in your spare time. some of the sentences make no sense and are really not that practical for general conversation also some words are repeated over and over, and others just touched on occasionally, but all good fun I suppose"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Speaking doesn't work most of the time. There isn't much of a point in learning a language if a native speaker can't understand what you're saying. Also new words aren't taught properly once you advance to the next unit. Either a better tutorial needs to be set up or the lessons need a complete overhaul. I shouldn't need to go to the vocab tab to learn the new words unless you're supposed to by which it should be mentioned in tutorial.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo Spanish has given me a good beginning vocabulary. It does a decent job of reviewing words and mixing up reading and speaking lessons. Some listening lessons are spoken too fast for beginners. I don't like the ""woke"" agenda Duolingo integrates into the lessons. (i.e. Men married to men) It is not necessary to offend traditionally-minded users."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"although it's an excellent language learning tool, it can also be quite inflexible, forcing only one answer for certain translations when in fact, there is more ambiguity there. it can be frustrating when they ONLY want or accept things to be said one way."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So, this is not really a language learning app, what it is however is a vocabulary learning app. If you come here expecting to learn verb conjugations and real applicable ways to use things, you won't. You'll need to have some prior knowledge of the language and use of it outside of the app. But if you come in expecting to learn new words to expand upon your knowledge, it's actually great."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it's a very fun app, and having tried a week of super duolingo I say apart from limited gramatic explanations, I find it a very good learning app However, please, for timed challenges, add a 3-second timer before you're allowed to use or buy a timer boost. Since the ""purchase"" button is where the ""check"" button is, I've accidentally spent 1500 gems on timer boosts that I did not want. I also accidentally used one on my first star rapid review, as I pressed the use button while typing."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I loooove Duolingo. I love how interactive it is and all the difference languages you can learn. I also like how you can learn the languages letters witch makes doing the lessons a TON easier. The only thing on have a problem with is that i basically have to scream into my phone for it to register what I said. Beside that it works great :)
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Update: My original post was written before Duolingo jumped on the woke train. I have students who are angry that Duo won't allow them to opt out of offensive content because Duo wants to be ""inclusive."" That's fine. Give us the option to opt out of offensive material. Original post: I use Duolingo as my homework assignments for my students. I don't think there is any other method for learning a language as valuable as Duolingo. My principal even uses it. Absolutely brilliant."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Good application for learning a new language with ease. A lot of opportunities are given to correct mistakes and improve performance. I am learning Italian and I find it is much easier to learn, if we get to learn and get encouragement to keep learning by practice and alertness."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is a very good app so I don't want to give less than 5 stairs. I wish however they would listen to a suggestion I have. I don't like their payments method. I would gladly pay a small amount to remove ads but I don't like to pay for infinite harts. The possibility of losing hearts it's what keeps me focused. Buying hearts or increasing the max amount of hearts, are good deals I would pay for."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really like this app. It is not the best language learning app EVER, but considering it is free, It has past my expectations...for a while at least. I'm a member of a family plan, but before I was, I would get an ad at the end of almost every lesson, which I didn't mind until it would crash after each of these ads. The app saves that you have done the lesson, but because of the crash, you don't get the gems for daily quests, and eventually, the daily quest doesn't count to the badge gauge."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's mostly a good app. I knocked off a point for the times where they are too fixed on a specific answer without accounting for other words that can be used in Spanish. I know the language, but don't know what specific wording they want typed out. Other times, they won't accept a direct translation from the English grammar they use in the question. Both Spanish and English make use of a gerund, i.e. ""eating"" is ""comiendo"" in Spanish."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I am absolutely learning new Spanish words & reinforcing the grammar/conjugations I learned in grade school (I took 7 yrs of Spanish, 8-15 y/o, am 25 now). It would be helpful to have more English examples where I have to translate to Spanish from scratch. Starting languages that are ""brand new"" to me with duolingo is harder; it's exciting for a few lessons, but then it gets to be extremely discouraging when you get to grammar & have no idea what you're doing & continue to fail."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's good for the basics of a language but it lacks relevant explanation a lot of the time. My main course is French which is well developed. I am quite near the end, but it keeps getting extended. I am noticing more and more mistakes - presumably as they rush to add more content. At my level I don't think I gain much from it, but it's a habit and it's easy to fit into daily life. I have also used the app for basic Welsh which was good fun."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Its translation function is too rigid, and there's no need to repeat simple content all the time. Duolingo can increase the difficulty as much as possible to speed up the learning progress, maybe can at least triple the learning speed, otherwise the most basic level courses like level A1 will take more than 3-4 months."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The current version of the app is broken, as reported by a number of other users. Progress along the path doesn't update unless the app is force stopped, otherwise you repeat the lesson. The app erratically says it is offline, while clearly communicating with the servers."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I joined in May 2021 and have a 843 day streak (albeit with several freezes). Unfortunately it's gone downhill since I joined. Various updates have messed things around (expecting me to know words it hasn't taught me, re-teaching me words I've already learnt, changing the format so I can't go back to old lessons). Now the company has laid off a large proportion of its translation experts in favour of AI (which is already making flaws worse). No alternative for my language but I've had enough."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"In general very good, but the timed exercises are a bit of a rip-off. In effect, these test not only ones linguistic ability but also ones typing speed. As I can only type slowly, I cannot complete the exercises unless I purchase extra time, which is expensive. Shame."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love it, it helped me learn Spanish it taught me so many things and it reviewed the mistakes I made and it's so amazing I just don't like that the hearts don't get refilled until hours gone past I wish it was like 10-15 minutes but thats fine I recommend you duolingo when you want to travel and learn new languages and words you never knew! Sincerely. Kathy"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love how fun this app makes learning interesting I love all the reminders and everything, but the language that I'm learning is something that I have picked a few words in and I can connect simple sentences. what we're learning is okay but I feel like it's informal, there are grammatical errors that needs to be fixed I'm learning Zulu and the Zulu that is spoken on the ground is somewhat different"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best language app ever. I have tried another app. But not as effective as this. Even with the free version, if you work hard, you can learn a new language efficiently. The step by step guide and the incorporated learning psychology, is what make this app unique.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,it's an amazing app i can now even have conversations I am learning French and i love the visualizations and I love that not only are we just touching the screen but we are also texting and speaking which I think is really effective. It's just overall an amazing app!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"For me, it is still the best app to learn a language and I use it daily. The new update sacrificed some flexibility - please allow repeating a topic again - but aligns better with my approach, so I am happy with it. Gamification is not for anyone, but it keeps you motivated. Areas that need some improvement is the applicability of the content in every day conversations and better explanation of concepts and grammar. Some vocabulary builder functionality would be nice as well."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Everything inside the app is great just the limited heart option looks so strange for free learners. I m learning since 2020 to 2023 i had take a break for an year due to some personal work ... Now rejoined the app and found the .. great mesh over the app... Really made the app worst day by day.... That's disappointing... We need the older duo back... The new one isn't good.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I am considering ending almost a thousand day streak on this app because the quality of translations has plummeted ever since they pivoted to focus on AI. They also removed the comment sections on the exercises which is so disappointing. Its helpful to read an explanation of the answer even if the comments are locked. I honestly feel like my skill hasn't progressed at all in 2 years as an intermediate speaker
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I think it's a great way to learn. However, your ""practice 5 weak words"" is bogus. I keep seeing the same 5 words over and over. I question whether they were my ""weak"" words at all! What's more, many of the ""5"" words aren't really any I'd use very often. (So why practice them ad nauseum?) Moreover, there are SO many words that I've been exposed to, I really would like more practice with those other words!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A great learning tool that is definitely helping me learn. I am not always sure how things work however. A bit of explanation about how the interface works would be very helpful. For example, I am not sure what hearts, gems or xp are even used for."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's a very nice app and it's quick to learn a new language, but it takes time to load and there is too much ads. It's all about the Super Duolingo, you can't focus on what you were doing when it is updated. So please Duolingo,fix this"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love it overall, but I do have some things I don't like about it . I am super grateful for it though , because of it and my dedication to learn languages . I don't like the constant changes , I feel like the whole course is just became a mess , jumped from section 3 lesson 15 to 39 without doing anything, and then I checked and I didn't even learn a lot of those between. I don't know what's going on."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very recommended!! Perfect app to start a new language. EDIT: I've been learning for quite a while with Duo. The recent problem is that in the middle of learning, the app restarts, and I'm back to the start of where I had been learning before. That's kind of annoying ... hope it can be fixed somehow"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Super annoying how pronounciations are so buggy. In Japanese I sometimes enable them with Hiragana but they will show up Romanized. Even when disabled if I open the app from a notification reminder - pronounciations will be showing. This basically nullifies the exercise and I have to force quit the app.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Very good app for learning and was very smooth and easy to use but for some reason it's become buggy and poorly optimized. I practice and it fails to register. There's conflict between my streak on the app and the app widget. Now it's even impossible to log in
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really like it, and the way you gamified it, and the only problem I have with it is the creepy notification you get if you miss your daily lesson. Other than that, It's amazing. It really helps me remember, because of how fun it is, and the widget on my home screen telling me my daily streak helps me remember too."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Intuitive with a smooth learning curve. Loses a star because it freezes often on my Samsung phone and requires a force stop. Edit - loses another star because it has developed another bug which prevents progress. It keeps forcing me to do lesson 6 of 5.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"the game is very good! I would definitely recommend it! the downsides are that you only have five hearts unless you pay and that sometimes it marks the answer wrong even when it's right. But, otherwise, this is definitely the best language learning game I've played!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"There are a lot of ads. There is one ads after every lesson. We all know that money is necessary to develop an app but if so many ads are posted after every lesson then people will start deleting the app.Reduce the ADS a little and reduce the health regain timer a little because it takes a day to get full health. One more thing why does the app crash sometimes due to ads, I have to restart the app again and again."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This is a nice way to learn to listen to a new language. There is no oral part so you will not learn to speak it. The app is confusing and there is no guidance at all. If you change a setting, you can't change it back. The help page doesn't open. You can email your feedback but no one will answer. You need a keyboard that has accent marks. I'm stuck with the paid version for now but I'm going to try another one because I want to speak, not read about man, woman, rice, water forever and ever."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Updated my earlier review regarding the hearts system usage. Since it turned out to be a way to monetize the app, I'm now much more accepting towards it (at least, there is a logical explanation to it). The app also got multiple improvements over time that mitigated most of my previous negative feedback. There is still a lot to do and a lot of bugs to iron out (both in the app itself and in the content), but now it's indeed one of the best in the market for its class."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I am not giving this all 5 stars because in this app so many questions are used to repeat and in the questions where I have to speak the sentence. I always used to pronounce it right but it always shows try again this was not perfect. but my pronouncation is always right but according to the app those were not right. so, give this app a bit more functions and facilities and make it best."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good app for learning languages. However, since the recent update, I have to close my app and reopen it after every lesson otherwise it just keeps making me do the same one over and over again which is very frustrating! Please let me know when this is fixed."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Doulingo needs more useful information. There's barely any normal sentences that I could use in a conversation. They normally put the weirdest sentences for you to type out or to say. This app doesn't even teach you how to count 1-10, or give you the option to try to learn the pronunciation of the words depending on what language you're learning. I wouldn't really recommend this app for learning a language. üòï"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"in just three days I was able to greet in French. I am really grateful with Duolingo. I therefore recommend and call upon everyone to try this magic software, whether trying Spanish, french, Japanese, and many other languages. You can also use it to improve your English language to those who know it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I took advantage of the 2 week unlimited trial. At the end of the trial I noticed that the free lessons got a lot longer and harder. And if you lose all of your hearts before you complete the lesson you don't get credit for the lessons. Although you practiced the lesson it doesn't count because you ran out of hearts. Rules to the language are not clearly explained. I was learning Hawaii there are 3 words for the word ""the"" but no rule on when/how to use. Full version not worth the price."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This used to be a 5 star review. Then they worsened the course layout massively to the point where I lowered it to 2. AND THEN they fired a bunch of their language staff and intend to replace them with AI, demonstrating their commitment to ruining the app entirely - so 1 star it is. I will not be renewing my subscription when it runs out, and am already looking for a replacement."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"this is dope, intuitive and addictive. learning mandarin and the ability to turn off the English characters üëå just what I wanted. very good app. adds are pretty unobtrusive. very good app. my kids are gonna ""play"" duolingo as soon as they can."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it's great but the free version makes it a lot harder with the loss of hearts, you need to be able to get your hearts back a lot sooner and the price of super is so expensive, but I do love it but to stay relevant on the leaderboard you need super ."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have used it for 3-4 languages. Close to zero effort put into teaching grammar. When I dared using it for Arabic it didn't even start woth bothering teaching how to read their script, to which I am not used to as a European ( Greek). Since recently I use to practice German, whic I have learned already by attending real life classes. It's badly designed for a language like German where grammar plays important role and the verbs/nouns/pronouns change regularly. Bad at teaching articles too."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is a good app to learn or brush up on a language. If the app developer is reading this review, please allow for a ""vacation"" mode to pause progress without constant reminders. Also, some of the story lines are offensive to some people groups. Please refrain from ostracizing many people to appease or acquiesce to the few."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Good but not without mistakes. I just removed two more stars because of the bots you'll find yourself competing with most of the time. Trust me, it is full of bots and they'll go online once you pass them in rank. They'll also rank high because they do a high number of exercises per day just to force you to log in and practice. It is something I really detest. Change this and I'll change my rating."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I feel that duolingo is a great way to learn any new language with short exercises and enhances your vocabulary. It makes and foreign language easier even if you are a beginner for that particular language. You must try it.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm surprised that I am actually learning a language. While I am just starting I am picking out words and phrases in bradcast media. The UI is very particular, but intuitive. I am happy to take advantage of this app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hey duolingo! I have a problem In the heart options section, for the past few days, the system has always said an error for gaining heart, if it can't, then i can't continue my lesson, what is the solution for this issue? (I already try to erase my app's chace and data but it's still not working)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app for those who want to learn to spea another language. Their notification and streak counter makes me want to continue my streak even harder. You might not get fluent in another language using this app, but learning a few words over the course of some chapters makes learning easier and more fun."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I think,it is more better than other apps it also helps to students to learn other language but when it comes to speaking it would be more challenging than just learning words or phrases so I believe it's not so bad except from speaking one but speaking is not duo's problem because we can't improve our speaking skills without communication so overall it's handy thank you duo üòâ"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a great app that helps you learn languages effectively! I love that I am determined to keep my streak going and that means I do my learning every day. It is designed to help you keep your streak going so it gives you ""freezes"" to use so you can skip a day every now and then without losing your streak. I love this app. I am at a 23 day streak with French and counting."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Terrible App Updates! After Fridays update the app stopped accurately adding my points to the leaderboards. Initially force stopping the app solved the issue but by Sunday that didn't help either. The latest update has me completely the same lessons repeatedly. Force stopping led to the app icon no longer working so I have to go into Google Play to open the app. I've also completed the same lesson three times which is why I force stopped and once again points aren't counting. Pease fix.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Hello I'm a subscriber with a streak of over 1400 days, normally practicing twice a day but I'm getting annoyed by recent problems with Duolingo. Basically it often says I have a reward of 15 mins of double XP for finishing a mini section but it doesn't give me them. It used to be gems quite often which was better anyway. Also often it says that there are 40 points for a practice hub session and despite doing it perfectly it only gives me 25. Frustrating!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Jokes aside this app is actually amazing at helping with learning different languages, and I like how it let's you learn at your own pace unlike learning in the real world where if you're not there from the start you cannot learn a thing. At the moment, I'm learning Japanese and I already have 89% accuracy. 100% would recommend you give it a try."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"love duo, obviously it wont make you fluent but if you are like me and most of the time just rush a lesson every day so you dont loose your streak, you actually end up learning alot without trying too hard. so if you just want to learn a bit or are fully serious about learning a new language, it is beneficial to use duolingo and just an extra thing in your daily routine"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"After finishing the German course + section 6, I gotta say that after section 7 was added, section 6 became entirely pointless because now it's essentially the same thing as section 7. But even ignoring this fact, section 6 is still WAY TOO LONG (22 UNITS???) and VERY UNBALANCED. Without any exaggeration, there were sentences that I saw over 20 times, and at the same time, there were words that I only saw once or twice in the entire section! Frankly, section 6 was mostly a waste of time."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"By far the best app I've used to start learning a language, I find the structure and variation is really helping me remember and enjoy the learning process. Love the way Duolingo teaches Japanese characters, I can now read Hiragana, Katakana and some Kanji!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Well. I'm glad I'm learning because the bug in the program is about to make me miss the march challenge - it keeps having me repeat the same lesson over and over again. Not registering the experience, and keeps resting my streak. I'm at 742 days. It tells me every time I repeat the lesson."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,overall the application is awesome. so far I've improved in figures of speech and pronunciation. I think that you should add a hands free mode to enable a person to study and run errands.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I wanted to learn Arabic for a long time now. I heard about this app and it's amazing! totally recommend. but the main issue is running out of hearts or so.it takes forever to refill and I lose my streak sometimes. idk if it's a glitch for me but Duo please fix this problem
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"duolingo is literally great to learn from, it encourages you to not make mistakes and learn from them. it's a great way to learn a new language even more all at one time. the rewards make learning a new language fun! in learning italian right now and I'm very hooked to this app. per favore, download this app grazie!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I procrastinated on learning a foreign language for years, but with Duolingo I'm rapidly learning the basics. I don't think this app alone would help you gain fluency, but it's a very solid way to drill basic vocabulary and grammar."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Dropping all the way down to 1 star. For the past week, this app suddenly stop keeping accurate count of the points. Most annoyingly, it appeared to have stolen over $20 in gems. I bought them and when it came time to use them, the app acted like I didn't even press anything. It did this until I noticed all of the gems I purchased were gone. Done with this app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo makes sure you understand, it gets you to read the words a lot so it's makes them more rememberable and it lets you fix your mistakes. It's good at reminding you to practice and it doesn't take long to do a lesson or multiple."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,really good if you want to learn Spanish. one thing I don't like about it though is that you lose hearts. sometimes you don't understand so you lose even more hearts then you have to do it lesson to get those hearts back. kind of sucks sometimes but still really good learning game
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love it because I learned some German and NO other ones, bc I wanted to speak only German and English. but lest time I played I had to do other languages because I ran out of hearts and I tried to do Limited hearts and let my dad do it, but it EXACTLY SAID. $0.00 and he had to pay. so if you run out of hearts practice to earn them, that's what I did. thanks for listening."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"very good, and the constant repetitions are good, but excessive without any chance to skip except the entire lesson. üòû.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this game! It's the perfect game if you want to learn a language. It has so many different languages to learn. It's teaches you how to say things in many different ways. For example: it's teaches you how to order food, say good morning or good night, and it teaches it how to express your feelings and how to say your name. Definitely reccomned this game. It's just a fun game and experience!"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Cute app that gamefies learning language. It costs money if you want to learn for longer periods of time (unless you never make mistakes, but that's how we learn best!) but most serious language learning programs would cost you money and so much more, so for free this app is wundebar"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is such an amazing app if you are looking to learn a language! When I first downloaded it I thought I would never learn a language but they make it slow and steady and give you some challenging questions now and then but overall good work from the Duolingo team!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I spent almost 170 days trying to learn Italian for an upcoming trip. I feel like i can read some Italian ok but for the most part it was a waste.

I am having to ask everywhere I go ""parli inglese"" because I clear can't speak or interpret Italian being spoken to me."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I'm currently having super Duolingo.Before I had it (the super version) it would always give me the ads during lessons.You could it was something that I hated.Even though I skipped it all it seemed like it was forcing me to take it.Now it even said that it would give me two weeks free. But I had to pay for it.And I don't even know about the updates these reviews are saying tbh.Its not that bad to be honest so yeah.But I would definitely say that this app kinda wants you to buy the super version.

Duolingo helps me learn quick and easy, but when I get to a more competitive league, looking at the leader board makes me feel like I need to be 1st. Other than that it's a lot of fun."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"While the app is great and constantly evolving, I'm not so sure about the company behind it. I'd rather be taught by experts building curricula than generative AI. I've been a paying customer for a while, but we'll see if that continues."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I really like that they're free. But the only thing that's kept me going is my will. This program is full of stupid lessons that you haven't learned yet but get punished for not knowing. And they have never learned to pronunciate they're words. This learning program teach needs to the words first THEN teach you how it sounds to speak. This as been around too long for such amateur hour dedication!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Helpful for me learning Spanish. Now it seems to keep hanging up and I have to close it and shut it down quite frequently Really annoying that it keeps claiming I've used my 'Streak Freeze' when I've not missed a session.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A few flaws. 1st, when doing a speaking Lesson, you get 3 tries to get it right. This is fine. The thing that bothers me is that when I speak, sometimes it doesnt hear me & I lose a heart. Im learning portugues and I speak spanish. Meaning that the way I speak in portugues is pretty acurate. I shouldnt lose a heart because it couldnt hear me. 2nd, the XP potions. When Im doing a lesson to continue my streak, I dont need a potion. When Im motivated to do, let me use one. I Dont want to waste them"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Terrible text to speech instead of native speakers. Sometimes has you spell out a word from your target language in your native language yet doesnt adhere to the spellings it told you that a specific character is represented as. If your serious about learning another language this is not the app.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It has wonderful exercises! Best againsti many other language learning apps.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's actually helping me learn which is why I putted a 4 star review but the reason it isn't 5 stars is becuase it takes time to get back to the actual lesson becuase you have to keep practicing until you get a heart but then you just get 1 heart which most people are likely to fail that's why I rate it 4 starts.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Did you use to? I dislike when they start the questions like that, and it's a lot. There is an issue with broken english being used to ask questions that the answers they want don't match. They will mark answers wrong if you don't use ni√±o or ni√±a when there is no indication in the question. I tried to ignore it at first but it becomes more prevalent as you progress. It's cute, but I wouldn't buy it or depend on this. I can see how it takes advantage of people who don't see the flaws."

It makes me sad to see such a decline in quality, especially given that I've spent years committed to learning with Duolingo. 1:1 translations rarely work, and AI eliminates the cultural nuances and the humanity behind every language as well. I know this review probably isn't going to change anything since money seems to matter more than people, but I felt it was worth saying regardless."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The progress is stuck and does not move ahead after once the lessons are finished. I have the latest update, but that too doesn't fix the problem of progress being stuck. Also the hourly chest isn't available anymore."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There seems to be a bug due to which I am unable to do speaking exercises. As soon as I speak, the it stops and registers nothing. Microphone permission is on, speaking exercises in duolingo settings are on."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love Duolingo! I have a 68 day streak and have learned so many new words. I'm learning Chinese and can count to 10. I love it and recommend it to everyone. The only thing I don't like is the ads but you can pay for Super Duolingo. Without Super Duolingo you can still have a fun learning experience with little ads.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Duolingo! I am currently learning French and the app is very helpful, fun, and even addictive! I recommend it 100% if you want to learn the basics of a language and be confident when speaking it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Issues lately with weekly point totals not being accurate or likely to be fixed; with delays in the app trying to process speech while in timed courses; with practice exercises not rotating between different possible options; and finally with the lack of response or even acknowledgement that there are issues.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Generally like it however the timed mini events and games are becoming so difficult to win due to the complexity of sentences they expect you to complete within the impossible time limit it's becoming very demotivating. Meh.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"don't have any sounds while pressing on the sound buttons, listening exercises are not working also i couldn't get my exp from passing the lessons, but now it fixed itself. i re-installed the app and the probem still exists"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is great!The lessons it offers are amazing! One small thing though; I am a Chinese person learning Japanese, and it's teaching me Kanji way later than my liking. I find it easier if instead of „ÅÑ„Åæ„Å™„Çì„Åò„Åß„Åô„Åã I get ‰ªä‰ΩïÊôÇ„Åß„Åô„Åã with kana at the top of kanji. I know it's a small thing but that woulf make my life a million times easier if there was a feature called 'are you Chinese' just so that you can pickup the language easier, because Kana is getting me confused but Kanji lets me understand better"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"On March 20, 2024 I paid $129.89 for Super Duolingo Family Plan. Right after the purchase I am not allowed to finish a lesson without spending additional money for time boosters. That is not ok. What is even worse is after I spent another $10.81 nothing changed and I am still constantly offered a choice of buying time boosters or ending the lesson. If this is not a bug than it is a shameful business practice."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it's the best tool to to improve your vocabulary in a new language and understanding grammer, it also respects that you may not be able to speak at the moment in certain exercises and gives you the option to skip without penalty, couldn't recommend more"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app drains your time over actually teaching the language so the developer gains money through the ads and subscription. I was spending at least 30 mins a day for more than a year (the streak lasted 995 days) and I don't think it was worth the invested time.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I downloaded the app, and it's fun to learn new languages while having a good time, but the fact that Duo doesn't have Afrikaans is a big L to me. I struggle in Afrikaans, and it would be very helpful if it did have it, but sadly, it doesn't. The only South African language it supports is Zulu, and although that's good, I would rather have an option to do Afrikaans."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I think it is the best app for learning of all languages! I have learned Chinese from it, and now Learning Italy though I am an Indian! It's like a game, You have to achieve your per day goal! Well Fonts, Well designed, App Interface is Awesome!! Just Go for it...."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,personally I think that this app gets a really bad rap like people always say that it's toxic and it says terrible things and it's like really weird and pushy but I disagree it's actually very helpful and I really like this app I totally suggest you get it and honestly just give it a chance and don't get it just cuz you want to see if it's like how people say get it because you want to learn a new language and expand your interests and languages
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,this app is really helpful guys . the reason why I didn't give full stars is because in each lessons the give only 5 hearts si if we make 5 mistakes in a lesson we can't do the exercises but this game is so fun and u get something called as streaks everyday . if u miss one day u have to go back to the beginning. in beginning I am telling our streaks will go to the beginning not the lessons. we'll I hope u all found this helpful. bye üëã
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I think there is a bug in this app that doesn't allow me to move forward to the next lesson unless I closed the app and start it again. I checked that I updated to the latest version. But it is very annoying that this happens now and it happened once in the past. This time it doesn't seem to go away. Any suggestions?
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I like the idea as a language learning app. The stressful thing is about the hearts and ads popping up every time you quit or complete a lesson. The Super Duolingo membership is a cash grab. Practicing for getting hearts is brainwashing. Bad experience.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Hey! I've been trying to log in on Duolingo app and it keeps telling me that I'm offline or no network connection. And my network's working perfectly cause I redownloaded it twice just to log in. Please fix this. Thank you.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it's great for refreshing things you've forgotten, and mostly learning a new language. I wished it had more tips, as sometimes its not clear why some words are chosen over others, but overall its awesome. I have used it every day on my phone and on my computer at home. I very much recommend it!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,it is a pretty cute and simple learning app with duolingo and completing lessons quick and easy but learning Spanish is a little time consuming but it makes languages easy to learn so my opinion about this app is it is unique and simple with a small duolingo motivating you and giving direction üòä
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,at First I was learning French bc I thought it would be fun then a bit later I thought I should try to work on my Spanish I already knew Spanish sense it's my first language but sense I grew up in a place where English is used a lot I don't really use it unless I'm talking to my parents and the great thing is you can learn multiple languages at once good byeee ‚úåÔ∏è
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Actually it's a nice app, but the french course isn't as good as it should be. For context I am learning french my 6th year, currently having B2, so I use Duolingo to revise and learn new vocabulary. First of all the course offers few possibilities of answers. I can't pass certain levels, because only one answer is correct even though there are 3 different ways of answering in real life. The second thing is, I noticed some vocabulary being outdated/less in use than the not-accepted synonym."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love this app, the only thing that bothers me is how you have to pay gems and such for pretty much anything extra and you can only pay for the whole year of super duolingo, or pay 12 dollars for a singular month instead of just paying the year long one monthly."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I'm really enjoying using this app so far! I didn't realize how easy it could be to pick up the language. The only thing I wish was able to happen for the free verison is conversation with other people learning the language as well because I unfortunately have no one to practice it with at home
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I recommend this app for many reasons. There are no adds to this game, you can learn more then 1 language at the same time, and when you want to learn a language before you start the cores it tells you some history behind the the language you want to learn. There is 1 down side to this if you forget to go on it for 1 or more days it will kinda freting you but not in a scary way. Hopefully this will help you decided if you want doulingo or not."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very easy to use. It helps and motivates you to keep on learning, by competing with others, and tells you keep your streak going. Even for the free version, it's great to use."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"i love duolingo sooo much. it has great features, and it really does teach you the language you're going for. also i have a small question, is duolingo music only for ios? i can't seem to find it on my android, and i have updated the app many times but it still dosent show up."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,A really good app to learn any language. It's very interactive and just like a game. But they put ads in it. Though they are not many it's still annoying for someone who has used duolingo a year before when there were no ads.

However it doesn't seem to detect my microphone for speaking exercises which is on and for which I have given permission to be used. This has not been a problem using Duolingo in the past so idk why it is now, and I've always had an Android. Please fix. Also grammar lessons in between would be helpful to understand WHY it's like this."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is fun to use and a bit additive which is great for learning but I've noticed some errors in it. I'm a languages major and noticed that the French modules teach you that the subject ""il"" means ""one"" but ""on"" is one (conjugated the same) and ""il"" means he/it. It also doesn't properly explain ""desu"" in Japanese. Simply put, it doesn't mean ""it's."" ""Desu"" is used to show formality. There are other errors in german as well with ""I'm sorry"" etc."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app has many annoying errors, such as arranging words into phrases that convey the correct meaning, yet the app still reports errors. Moreover, discrepancies exist between the listening and text parts. Although I've reported most of the errors, it seems that Duolingo may not be willing to address and fix them, persistently repeating the same issues. Having purchased a 1-year paid software package, I'm reconsidering renewing it and hesitant to recommend it to others. üò°üò°üò°"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really want the app to have more English learning material, e.g, grammar tips, pronunciation tips/rules e.g., for the letter 's' (in the middle or at the end of a word) as either 'z'-sound or 's'-sound. !Please pay attention on what I would most like you to add: The use of the International Phonetic Alphabet for the pronunciation of the sounds / words in every dialogue / text in the app will be absolutely useful for the learners. It will greatly help the correct pronunciation."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is the best language learning app I've used; the weekly leaderboards and leagues really give you that competitive push while still letting you learn at your own pace. the grammar tips are really useful and the app is just amazing. I highly recommend it to everyone trying to learn a language, whether it's for school or not. üëçüèª"

And the button on my phone to turn the notifications on apps of isn't working properly, so plz fix this!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I never review products so this is a first. duo has helped me learn and use German to communicate somewhat well. although there are some things that I wish duo would teach within the first unit. it is a solid experience that I have suggested to others who want to learn languages. Good app, I wish there was a dictionary for researching and studying words for future reference."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"one of the few apps I would not mind paying a subscription for , I traded in scrolling endlessly on different social media apps to learning a new language . Personally it fits my learning style to a T and is super easy to understand. I would recommend to others wanting to learn a new language or just explore something new and different."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"OMG so good I honestly LOVE Duolingo. It's easy, and each session should take 5-15 minutes. I 'm learning so easily. it takes a bit longer than babble¬Æ. But babble¬Æ squeezes everything in 1 session. and pressures you. If you want to learn a language easy then go for Duolingo. It's also kid friendly! üòä"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"wow! duolingo had definately improved since i used it and stopped for 6 years. i love the idea of a ladder course and its graphics are amazing. truly the best learning tool for mobile phones. However, sometimes, when we dont have super, whenever we complete a lesson, the add dont load properly and the app crashes. When i restart the app, the lesson's completiom wasnt registered. This frustrates me."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been doing Duoling along with my high school Spanish class, and thanks to Duo, I am the best Spanish speaker in my whole grade, maybe even in the whole school! Duolingo has really helped me with my Spanish, especially the vocabulary learning that we all hate, and I would not be getting A's in Spanish class without it. In essence, I would highly recommend using Duolingo even if you only desire to learn a language casually, but especially if you're in a Spanish class of some sort. Thanks Duo"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm back after several years away and I've gotta say, the improvements they've made are exactly what I wanted when I stopped using the app. I use it for Japanese and they now include explanations for grammar and guides for how to write the characters. things I had to try to work out for myself the first time. highly recommend!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I supplement with it to learn spanish. it has helped a lot, but some of the ads are getting insane. I understand they need to make money, but a 30 second plus unskippable ad for a scam game is crazy, and if you mute it, after the video portion it turns the sound on and makes you wait to hit x to close the ad. foolishness."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Having come from using Babel, I've found that Duolingo is a wunderbar (wonderful) app to teach you another language. There really is no need to spend money on it at all, since they give you the choice to practice in order to earn more hearts, but the option is there to subscribe and therefore no need to worry about limited chances. It is very engaging and effective at what it does."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app. It's such a great way to learn other languages in your spare time at your own pace. I'd highly recommend it to kids too! Update - the app isn't adding to each lesson I do.... Making it impossible for me to advance to the next league so I'm stuck. I wrote down my score and did 2 lessons and wasn't given credit for them. Update the only issue I have is the competition against other people I do not do this for that purpose I prefer to take my time and learn it I don't like rushing
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app, it's a gamified way to learn a good variety of languages. You learn words, the alphabet (if it's different from your native), you learn how to formulate sentences, and there's an aspect of competitiveness with other users. The only reason I give it 4/5 and not 5 stars is because you do not have the option to learn other variants of a language, for example Brazilian Portuguese is the only Portuguese you can learn whereas Portuguese from Portugal is not an option."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have been using it for a long time (with Duolingo Plus nearly 3 years), but now that I have the opportunity to use my knowledge seems like if I didn't knew anything, all the grammar explanation for small languages is almost forgotten in the app, the only thing that could change this point is a more detailed grammar explanation section, like the one that appears up top every path, besides this huge disadvantage the whole app is good for learning languages."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great, I learn Japanese. I can read hiragana and katakana within 2 weeks. Itu would be great if you can add search feature for words that we've already learned before, it sucks to scroll to look for old words. Another feature I suggest is stand alone write hiragana, katakana, and kanji exercise feature outside path. Because I can remember hiragana and katakana fast but when to write those, I remember poorly. I want to suggest the Japanese is based on JLPT level not CEFR."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's great practice, I just wish it wasn't so expensive (no lifetime membership available, monthly/yearly only). You're a bit limited on the free version with what you can practice, but if you can afford it, it's a great and fun way to learn a new language IMO!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app asked me to review them... So here it is. The lessons work and you do learn the language, but you'll want to blow your brains out because of the constant ads to buy ""Super Duolingo"". Then you have the stupid heart system they use that basically screws you from learning anymore because you're just too frustrated to continue with the lesson. I have no clue who's idea it was to force this Super Duolingo down your throat for more then the cost of Netflix, but it's not working."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"After using Duolingo for 18+ months of learning German there are things I love and then some problem areas that are inconsistent. I like the reading, writing, speaking & listening style of learning however regularly when I try to open the app it will not open and words have changed.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Amazing! i'm not sure if i'm the only one who notices this but, sometimes when I get an ad and when I skip it, the ad just keeps repeating and I have to close the app to get rid of the ad. Thats the only problem I have but everything else is excellent!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very misleadingly gave me a trial which ended with charging me for a YEAR subscription, why would they assume that I wanted that? Typically such a scenario would end with being put on a monthly subscription. Then when I made this point to them I received an automated message saying that I can continue to contact them but they will not guarantee a response. Honestly one of the most disrespectful services I've used."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a very good app that helped me a lot in learning Japanese, I just started this to make my time productive, there is literally no error occurred during the sessions, the only doubt I have is that when I am learning words in Japanese I have doubt whether they're used in local Japanese per their in our Japanese. because if I translate the English sentence to Japanese another sentence just appears while both are literally the same. and everything is ok with this app! I'm very satisfied."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I was always scared of the reputation of Duolingo harassing users to maintain their streak. Now that I want to learn the language of my girlfriend, I can only appreciate that, and it's not as bad as it was claimed. I particularly enjoy the leaderboard. I do wish I could submit a list of specific words that I want to learn, to watch a specific movie for example. I wish that Duolingo didn't platform abusive ads. I would have bought the family plan anyway."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Update: I have been paying premium for almost a year and I like it, but the app is not counting my XP. What's going on? i love Duolingo! However, I just transitioned from iPhone to Android and noticed that the all is better on Apple. Please level the field for Korean and make it equally great for Android."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Duolingo for roughly a year now to learn German. It's a great app. It's courses can help beginners, advanced and anything in between! It has many languages to choose from. But, it can buffer and have a lot of lag. Overall, it is an amazing app for anyone to enjoy!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a great application, but sometimes I was have bugs. It's very difficulty to study English if the app don't play sounds. I can't guessed what's mean the silence so I choose at random variants sometime. I rebooted my phone, I reconnected to another access point, but it all didn't help me. Can you fix your app? Please!"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's the best app for learning languages, fun and competitive, but the only thing I'm not very okay with is xp boost because I'm a person who works on ground marketing using bus, I use this app whenever I get a seat on bus and have to go offline when it's time to get off the bus, so when I'm using xp boost, it just go to waste without me actually have to use it much, that might been more useful to me if there was an option that I can activate or pause xp boost as I wish"

Obviously you cant expect to be fluent off of repeating a few sentences a day on an app but it helps me to grasp the meaning of words and formulate sentences which has much enhanced my learning, and I will say that I would have been a useless tourist on my recent italy trip without it. Thank you to the brilliant minds behind a simple tool to help you learn without much fuss :)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,They change the entire course without warning and it's awful now. you have to speak advanced Chinese on level one! and fast! also I'm always interrupted and have to watch an advertising about not being annoyed and interrupted. it's like the Mafia breaking my shop while asking for protection money üëÄ
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Easy, fun and a good place to start with a language. Sadly, some great features were removed in recent years, such as discussion tab and disabling the word bank. It is hard to really learn words and sentences if you can't write them yourself."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app makes it so easy to learn another language. SERIOUSLY. The different types of exercises makes your brain think in different ways & keeps it more interesting than something that's repetitive. I'm typically a visual learner and this has a good mix, it's great."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"the previous educational format was more of wide view. learners could go back review a lesson their choice, repeat them to remember, for the their fluency advancement. or before starting a lesson they could study logical grammatical base. people could see story titles to review that helped their needs. where is the wide scenery? current format has a pipeview base. i think someone has messed up big time."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's too good for learning new languages. People , who want to go for holidays in a foreign country they can easily learn the languages in a short period of time. The most cutest character in this app is duo , He will help you in any problem. So, for learning new languages I would prefer Duolingo app . It is not helpful for me but also for many people."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo: Fun, Accessible, But Room to Grow Duolingo's bite-sized lessons and gamification kept me engaged in learning (language). The vast language selection is amazing, and its free version opens doors for all. I especially appreciate the focus on practical skills and the supportive community. However, more speaking/listening practice and expansion into complex grammar for advanced learners would be fantastic. Integrating with other platforms could create a more well-rounded experience."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm really enjoying using the app, and I would have rated it 5 stars, but I feel like it's missing a few basic features. 1.

It's also pretty transparent that I was sent a prompt to review the app after getting bonuses a 3 free days of the paid version, so, enjoy your 2."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Dear Duo- Why do you not want my money? Why the sudden rejection, Duo, my feathered friend, now fair weather.. ""Can't connect to Google Play"", Can't sign up for Super after I was random kicked off. Too many annoying bugs to deal with the heart system and ads as well. Was willing to pay even though the lessons often need to be reported for errors, and are inconsistent. It was more good than bad for the money I paid for my ANNUAL subs and now w/o warning I can't get support from them."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very good app! I would give it five stars if there was a way we could select a specific unit to practice, and also if it had a way of teaching conjugation rules. I'm learning Finnish, and I'm still confused with conjugating verbs and such. It would also be 5 stars if it wasn't giving me words I haven't learned at all. In my Italian course, I've had to match the English with the Italian word. It gave me plate, hat, and another word I didn't know. Please fix this Duo! üôè"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,it holds you artificially back so your learning process is extremely slow and tedious due to the vast amount of (unnecessary) repetitions you have to make to progress. taking shortcuts to a topic you want to learn is virtually impossible. overall a very unsatisfactory experience which seems to be more interested in keeping you in the loop as a (paying) customer than actually helping you to learn the language.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy it very much but it has bugs, one I constantly running is really demotivating, it does not count my completed lessons to the monthly badge, for example I had 33 lessons done in January, I wanted the badge so I started to go down with the lessons finished 7 and it's counting 35 on the monthly badge...disappointing and frustrating because it's not the first time when I notice this."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A very good app for learning foreign languages at any age. But after the last update it has some small problem. When the next exercise appears, the speaker still repeats the phrase from the previous exercise, and it is disconcerting and induces you to type what the speaker said and not what is on the screen. Anyway good job Duolingo. 23.12.3023. After the last update the points don't add corectly. Still having buggs at adding the points."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The app is great. I loved discovering new languages and the grammar rules. It's ever-evolving and I see how creative it became now. It would be amazing though if you guys could add the opportunity to listen to your audios in the speaking exercises in order to compare it to the original one.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's definitely a fun app. Unfortunately, it is not worth having at all unless you pay for it. You go through hearts fast, and they take an eternity to rejuvenate. They could have the hearts recoup faster. The app is a little on the expensive side. I was going to pay for it for a little bit, but you get hit with a 90 dollar lump charge at the beginning of your pay period."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I love the app but I really don't like that anyone can follow you - and the only option to fix it is to go completely private and not be able to participate in leaderboards any longer. There should be a 3rd option where you can approve follow requests or choose to not be followable while still being able to use leaderboards. This is basic internet privacy safety. Duolingo please fix.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app has become so slow, it's making it very unenjoyable to learn a language with. The constant lag and then it has turned into competing for points, which is a total turn off. Even the ads lag. I really don't want to use this anymore if they do nothing about the lag."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,my daughter got me into this. I was leaning Spanish for years and started to give up. but this app is bringing it all back but best off all teaching me words I have never seen. so beautifully diverse avatars and just an all round comfortable interface. just brilliant. it has adds but it's free so ads are no proble for such a life skill like learning a new language. this is so much fun üòä
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love Duolingo 5 stars. they have so many different languages and they help you learn it in a fast and fun way. they also have cute characters and tell you how to pronounce things when you don't know. as you go on you will unlock cool and fun things and you'll be excited to practice Duolingo every single day. when you practice every day you will get a streak and it's always fun to see how long you can keep that streak. you can also use freezes to make sure you streak stays. 10 / 10 get Duolingo
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app to learn any language. it's free therefore it is hard to criticize their little quirks, however their should pay more attention to the feedback provided by their users. That is the only way to let them know of the few bugs that happened once in a while using the app; most bugs are more of an annoyance than something catastrophic, but losing a bit of work and having to restart the lesson because of a bug, is not something that should happened, ever."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Good app for absolute beginners and kids. I used for 105 days for French. If you already know the language it is usually repetition. Edit: after 1.5 years of a few minutes everyday, I was able to get BTC-NCLC score: comprehension orale 3, expression oral 2, comprehension √©crit 4, expression √©crite 3. Not the greatest score ever. But that's only by using Duolingo everyday atleast 1 lesson. So the app is highly recommended to start learning a new language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great for getting started in just about any language, but is missing necessary resources and lessons that explain each language more thoroughly. Best used as a starting point or for supplement learning. Also, too many ads that interrupt the learning process."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm abandoning a 229 day streak and deleting this app because with the increased reliance on AI, I'm concerned that I'll be taught wrong. Duolingo has never been great for Japanese, but it had been accurate, and the short lessons and gamification kept me practicing. But when humans check the AI content to see if it's ""acceptable"" rather than ""accurate,"" that's a learning tool that can't be trusted. Layers of Google Translate is no way to understand language, and DEFINITELY no way to learn one."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,We've been paid members for a couple years now and we LOVE Duolingo!! Each of us has learned way more using Duolingo than we ever did in school learning the same languages. One of the coolest things to me is that I've been able to also learn just some basics in several different languages to kind of get a feel for them. Their methods work and actually make learning a language fun. The option to be competitive is also a big plus. Excellent!!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"After a month of trying out Duolingo in December I updated to the annual plan. Unfortunately this came at a time when they laid off 10% of their translators and are moving towards an AI model. They have already gotten me for a year so I will continue begrudgingly. Today I took two practice lessons in a row that were identical. Along with that there is no grammar guide and while I found the leaderboard fun and motivating, point farming becomes more of the focus than actual learning!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a very adorable and the only best learning app I have come across. The app makes learning a language in an interesting and fun maker, it also give you the chance to watch your streak making you always want to come in daily so as not to lose it. In summary I recommend this app to anyone who wants to learn a new language in a interesting and fun way."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"needs a large text mode. if you crank up the font size on your android settings the app doesn't adjust properly, and you can't answer the questions in the screen real estate available. Everything else about this language learning all is terrific. Just keep track of your glasses."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"UPDATE: Still no response from the developer. App still not working - strongly suggest you don't use this app. App randomly froze and wouldn't let me in. Tried deleting/reinstalling it, got asked to sign in and it's saying there's an error. If I reset my password it says there's no account registered with my email despite still getting emails telling me to keep up the good work. Have lost my streak and the effort I put in - emailed the support team but heard nothing. Terrible service"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible, I get y'all need to make money, but the heart system that is in place makes it almost impossible to learn a language at a pace you would like, and punishes you on new lessons and material you don't know yet, as well as taking 4 hours PER HEART to get back, one of the WORST language learning platforms out there, used to be good Edit: multiple years later, if I could give it even lower I would, app still trying it's hardest to make it impossible for you to actually learn the language"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After you guys laid off a bunch of staff and started using AI I've been noticing really bad lessons for French, the way it wants me to write sentences either often sound awkward or there's something not right for between both the English and French portions. Also for lessons where we chose the words from the word bank in the correct order, it's irritating that there will always be 1 extra word thrown into the bank that isn't meant to be used and is wrong, this will really throw ppl off."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I really don't feel like I'm learning anything. most the time I'm getting answers right with process of elimination not because i know the answers. As someone who has a loose understanding of Spanish coming into this, I feel like the app makes no effort to actually teach you why things are said the way they are. it only looks for if you know your vocabulary and not much more"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I tried Super Duolingo for free, and instead of ending it after 2 weeks, they ended it a dat earlier and charged me for the yearly subscription. I contacted them to cancel my subscription and refund me, so they immediately cancelled it, but haven't given me my refund so far. üôÇ They haven't replied to my last 2 emails regarding the refund. Give. Me. My. Money. Back."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Decided to come back to learning Japanese on this app after taking a pretty long break from it, and this ¬´coming back¬ª experience was very frustrating and confusing: the app greeted me with ¬´welcome back¬ª, but offered no help with getting back on track. I tried starting from the very first lesson that was accessible to me, but I couldn't ¬´retake¬ª that lesson, only ¬´review¬ª, so, having forgotten a hefty part of what I've previously learned, I kept making mistakes and quickly ran out of ¬´hearts¬ª."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Whilst I generally like Duolingo the constant changes are frustrating. The latest change where they've disabled word suggestion on gboard is really frustrating. It makes swiping to write words very awkward, and wastes a lot of time when I make typos on my small phone keyboard. I have a seven year streak but am considering ditching Duolingo as this change has made it more about being able to type accurately than know the language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duelingo is super fun in super educational . You should let your kids get it if they want to learn a second third or any any number of languages, and if they wanna learn multiple languages at once, they have the option to work on like 3 or more different languages. And it's helped me a lot on understanding Spanish. So I can talk to family."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Doulingo is a great way to learn a new language or as a refresher! It was a little strange that there is doulingo music and math on only certain devices though, for instance, my iPad has it but not my phone. I can't wait for them to update the music!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app has helped me learn languages in a way that school just does not and I am able to see good progress unlike the traditional method of having to learn a language by reading a book/magazine and then looking up the words in the dictionary or by having to watch a TV show with the language that you want to learn. The keyboard and voice feature is not working properly and not all the languages I wanted to learn are here, but despite that, this is a wonderful app with a fun way of learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall a great app, especially with the Super Duolingo. One issue I have noticed, however, is that the match madness has some form of bug that prevents 150 XP to be awarded. I'm not sure if it's just on repeats or every time, but I'm missing probably 600 XP because the bug only awards 120 XP."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Undoubtedly the most innovative language learning app. It is absolutely perfect for language that share English alphabets. Duolingo should evolve more to support languages with unique alphabets such as Bengali, Hindi, Hebrew, Chinese."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is a great app, and my friend does it now. It is the BEST app to use if you're traveling or just for fun. I love that you have a streak and freeze to protect it. Right now I have a 78-day streak, and I am up to section 2 unit 2. Also, I love the friend quests to earn rewards. Whoever started duolingo is a genius. I highly recommend you download this app RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is incredibly generous, as it usually makes you pay to get ""super duolingo"" however, on some random days, they may give you 3 days of it for free. Since you only have five lives, any starters to new languages may find this app very frustrating. Also, you need to go on this app every day because there is a streak you have to keep lit. For people like me, this is very addictive. There are also leaderboards eventually, making you practise even more. If you enter top 3, you get lots of exp!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The lessons are made exciting and very informative; all in a stress-free and relaxed atmosphere in order to aid even the most beginner type Learner in understanding, hearing, matching, and speaking the language with fun and ease. I especially love the characters' emojis as a means to both complement and encourage the Learner every time they score a correct point on each lesson exercise. Definitely helps the Learner to stay motivated with every passing progress."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo has to be the best language learning app I've seen but I have one problem with it, I think they kinda rushed the Korean in unit 4, it was introduced to fast, making it hard for people to learn easily. It's not easy learning up to thirty words at the same time, I think that has to be fixed"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"mostly good, but the learning technique isn't solid. no real understanding of conjugation or root words. it's all just memorization--if it sticks without the needed foundation. speaking has been glitching and marking my speech as incorrect when it didn't even let me speak. also, i do a lesson every day, but I'll get notifications saying I'm going to lose my streak or that it's been three days since I completed a lesson. luckily i don't care."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is great for learning languages, until you get to the end of section two, crappie gets difficult and almost impossible to do with only the five hearts given, you need to put a lot of time in, if you want to get anywhere. Or spend like 13 euros a month on the subscription. The subscription is fair enough, but I would prefer unlimited hearts with ads in between each lesson instead of a subscription"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I like it. Very good app. It's teaches you 40+ languages. I can't believe it. I like the wighets. Duo literally cheers on you! There's something wrong though. There's no animations on my Samsung device. I put on animation. There's no animations. Can you fix it? Also Happy 11th Birthday Duolingo!!!!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Uninstalled. Don't do it! It's a time/$ trap! Officially done. Been using faithfully for 5 years and have made no real improvements bc they reset my progress every time there is an update. None of the practice is cumulative. Way better apps out there for actually learning. This is more like a game. If you really want to learn a language like Japanese I recommend LanguagePod 101, italki, Busuu and YouTube language lessons."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,this is a great app. it makes learning a new language fun. the streaks and achievements really help take away the feeling that you're doing a chore or obligation while getting your lessons done. and the team lessons also help motivate you to keep jumping into your lessons. I recommend Duolingo to everyone I talk to that is looking to learn a new language. They even offer Klingon and High Valerian in case u have a S.Trek or GoT convention to show off at.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is an amazing tool to help all ages learn languages and I was really helped by it. However, when I realised they taught us South American Spanish, I couldn't use it anymore as I'm studying European Spanish for my GCSE's. Could you please have an option to learn European Spanish? Otherwise, it is amazing and would recommend to all."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"duolingo is wonderful for learning a new language but there is the problem of the paid subscription. I believe if an app is a learning app they should pay a life fee and have it forever instead of like ¬£60 a year I think. also the heart system they use is ok as unlike other apps you don't just wait an hour and regenerate hearts, you earn them by practicing"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Starting to suck. Frustrating. Submitted feedback for same problem several times last year. New year, same problems. Several lessons will not let you choose the words, therefore, you lose hearts and cannot continue. I was considering buying Super Duolingo, but this glitch changed my mind."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A very good app to learn single or with friends! üëç The only think i don't like is that you loose your streak very easy and it somehow forces you to make a lesson or something every day and it's sometimes kinda annoying because you have a lot of extra things to do, not just to do lessons. And also you loose so easy the league position but it's not your fault that other ppl go on try-hard playing and practicing 24/7. Anyways, is a nice and freindly app where, as how I said, its easy to learnüòÉ"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like Duolingo. It's great for picking up the beginnings of a language and some elementary vocabulary. I wish after completing the language course it were more useful, and I wish they would continue to add content to courses to make it more valuable over the long term. You won't become fluent, but it's a good start."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's a fine enough app. It doesn't do well explaining sentence conjunctions a well as going indepth on how to use words like que and esta properly. Most learning here is trial and error. The legendary changes can be kind of bs. Basically you need to pay for more time etc to complete harder challenges unless you're a freaking robot
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"They made a lot of changes and it get worse ower time. In browser you cant see your weekly xp progres, only in the app. Change the learning tree to a path which is worse. Now you absolute can't choose what you want to learn. Can't correct a 2 year old bug (in German speak lesson don't accept the correct pronunciation of ""zwei, eins""). The put a lot of once free thing under a pay wall. Also on older phones unoptimised, the app freeze all the time."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"really good and helpful for language learning, but ads after every lesson are a bit annoying. I understand you need ads for the money, and it isn't an overflow of ads, so I like it. I just also hate how much you always are like ""get super duolingo."" please make it show up a bit less"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Cute animations, interactive learning have come this far and this is one example of that. I really enjoy every lesson and I definitely recommend this app to others. I guarantee kids, adults, or even old people alike will not feel bored when learning a language they want on this app. It even teaches on writing Kanji in Japanese, which yet to be seen on Mandarin course for each characters, but I guess it is too much, so just take it slow. What I hate about this though is that they always threaten"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's good. I'm learning. but sometimes it's just too repetitive. And they recycle stories from the beginning of the course. I know they're probably trying to go for the whole ""repetition=memory"" idea, but it drags on a little too long at times."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It is kinda stupid. We only have 5 lifes, and we have to pay in gems or real money. Thos go for the rest of the time you play. It is nice the first 2 times you run out they just give you them for free. Overall, you or your child should get this game and super Duolingo. FYI, Super duolingo helps you learn faster and has UNLIMITED lives. Therefore, Duolingo is a ridiculously fun and affordable game, but it has its no's also. :) Thank you for reading my ""SUPER""(Duolingo, wink wink) long message!:)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's good and amazing like you are learning a language by an app which seems to be a game but the only problem I am facing is the limited hearts like I am not a teenager or an adult who could take a subscription on their own and my parents would never allow me to do so and also their are ads like after every lesson. So I would recommend the old version not the new version.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app works on Montessori learning , so it is very fun and playful . But , as everything has , it has a tiny problem üòê .

I never in my life thought I would say this, but I am actually having fun learning a language. 10/10 experience üëç"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Changing my review AGAIN. I'm learning Japanese, and the Kanji section is incredibly small after going through some of it. There are also too many repeat lessons in Kanji. And looking at how much is left, there is no way there's enough Kanji to properly learn the language, unless you're stuffing 90% of the Kanji in latter half of the lessons. On top of this, since the AI usage started, I'm seeing a lot more borrowed Japanese words than native ones. A few good changes, but also many more bad ones"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good to study grammar up to B2 and increase you basic vocabulary. Unfortunately they removed comments and discussions where it was possible to obtain a lot of useful information and explanation from teachers and advanced learners. Moreover latest updates seems generated by AI and contains weird typos, not a big deal but strange for language teaching application."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"some issues I don't get it why they don't start with the basics (for Spanish): introducing yourself, days, numbers, month, feelings etc. I've learned Spanish by using a book before and that's why I know the difference between the two to be-s estoy and soy - it isn't explained in duo: problematic. Another point is nadan e.g is translated to swim - one would guess they mean to swim but the 3rd person plural is meant - they should ask for they swim to make it clear. (German version)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I've been having issues where the app will refuse to accept properly spoken responses as well as properly typed responses and then recently learned that they fired a large portion of their team and replaced it with AI which now makes a lot more sense. I'll reevaluate my rating if they fix these issues and switch back to actual translators who know what they're doing.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The way the app has been designed to feel like it's a game is entirely the reason why I am able to come back each day and achieve the daily goals... Also the characters and personalities they have created are entertaining and enjoyableüòä and it is much easier to progress and learn when you have friends involved to keep each other motivated!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"you will learn a language if you stick to it, you will also need other resources too though. one thing I think Duolingo is missing is good explanation of things. it introduces some concepts without explaining them and you kind of learn them by repetition not by understanding the reason."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"How are people with disabilities supposed to learn if it's too hard. I'm right 99% of the time though and still It will either say I'm saying it wrong or times out so fast you can't even get your answer in. either way I'm marked as wrong, but you don't even go over pronunciation at all. I understand you have it set up to make people buy hearts to stay competitive, but this is ridiculous. I wish it was more focused on not being the fastest but being correct. it's just not fair."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I did give this App a 5* review. I had a family subscription so had paid them for their premium package. Then I had to replace my phone. When I tried to access my account I realized, after days of trying, that I must have used a capital letter in my email address. Therefore, no way to access any emails they send if you have forgotten your password. You cannot auto change your username/email, like other memberships. Duolingo has very bad customer service & I've lost my money. BEWARE!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"App has become increasingly worse at recognizing speech. Have to yell and still app doesn't recognize me. I don't know how the mechanics of app become worse after years and increased funding from ipo but the whole speech issue stops it from being a 5 star app. Also de nada in spanish translates into, ""it's nothing,"" not, ""you're welcome."" Teach me the literal language not the interpretation. And if you teach the interpretation then it should be along side the literal meaning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm doing French and German at 'rusty' level - so not quite beginner . The French is OK but the vocabulary choices for German are bizarre. At my level the likely use is for travel. I don't need to know the words for lawyer, or chess, or Chancellor. I want to buy bus tickets, order food and drink, and check which platform my train leaves from. I think I'll be digging out my Berlitz phrasebook - much more useful."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I wish I never updated the app! The curriculum always changes and it's hard to track my progress. Had to repeat the same lessons over and over. And for japanese courses, some words that are used to written in kanji are now in hiragana. It's like going back to elementary school when you're already in junior high. This app is wasting my time :("
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is good. But i had some trouble at the begining due to teaching method. I am using it for learning Japanese. I have former training from other sources which conditioned me to use polite language by adding ""desu"" at the end of each sentence. Duolingo starts with a more casual language approach (which is not a bad thing). As a result i made a lot of mistakes early on. I think it would be a good idea to take cultural aspects of a language into account when designing lessons."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is a great app, I am currently learning Duolingo and I see progress by the day, but I have one problem. The leages are fun, but they could be better, just yesterday I went down a leage because I had so much stuff to do. I couldn't do more than one lesson! Although when I do have plenty of time, I do my Duolingo but I have to wait 3 more days to get promoted again! So you could make the leage repair less expensive and make the time limit like 1-2 days"

Too many exercises on sounds without meaning. It never explains anything, no stories to read or dialog practice. I highly recommend the more full-featured HelloChinese app instead."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is definitely 5/5 stars. They update you whenever you need it, but they aren't being annoying by sending you notifications 24/7. When you are dedicated you get great prizes like 3 free days with Super Duolingo. There are usually no ads, but whenever you get ads they are only for Super Duolingo. Highly recommend!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app and fun. but some errors found. for exemple, the cat (gato) is used as someone's friend working in an office. I think AI compiled some (or all) exercises. With the Xps score ranking every week, Learning will be more fun with Duolingo if you have friends to Lear together. You can follow other learners and get inspired."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,My lessons don't get added to my streak unless I click through all the continue buttons to make it back to the home screen after the lesson. Previously you could access discussions on individual questions and someone will have explained the grammar on answers I didn't understand. Now I keep getting the same questiions wrong because I don't understand what rules apply. There were also better guides at the start of each level explaining the grammar.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo makes language learning a competition against other students when it doesn't need to. We all learn at different rates. Also, after a lesson, when new words are learned, there is no place in the app to view these words. Duolingo recommends that after a lesson, you write down as much as you can remember. How can one remember as many as 15 or more new words when you just sped through a lesson? There's definitely room for improvement."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Every update makes the app worse and worse Now you can't even change your profile picture and are forced to use the boring avatars in the app Every lesson is followed by ads (oftentimes unskippable) The top of the leaderboard is nothing but Duolingo Super users, making it impossible for the normal users to climb Lessons are extremely buggy, even rejecting answers that are correct word for word a quarter of the time And they aren't even listening to the users anymore, how nice :\"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a great app to learn a language! The app also makes it fun to learn, and as you do it every day, you get gems and a higher streak. It also gives you a reminder to do your lesson and the animation and characters are really cool! I would really recommend this app to people wanting to learn a new language, or a language that you already know a bit of but want to learn more! There are multiple choices in languages and you can learn multiple ones at the same time!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,took away the discussion sections and only shows you the translations half the time. it was helpful for some vocabulary but it used to actually be a good place to learn a language. also ads almost every lesson unless you want to pay $60 a year for no other benefit
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Has a recurring bug where every other lesson earns a fraction of the expected points for a score of 100%. They removed unit notes, stopped lesson discussion and questions where course maintainers answered, or natives explained grammar. The simplified everything, making gameify the priority over learning. One of their so-called ""motivational messages"" even alluded to quantity over quality of learning. They also closed their popular forums. There are better apps and services."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I would normally give it more but it's been having bugs and their help center is non existent. Just automated responses and websites that are not working. I've been trying to use ""speak"" lesson. Duo tells me to turn on mic (it's already on). I click ""turn on"" either way and nothing happens"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,For a very long time I have actually felt embarrassed that I could not speak another language. I don't speak proper English because I'm from the Black Country ;) At 54 years of age I've finally decided to learn French and I'm really enjoying the process. My wife and myself have found Duolingo a great fun way of learning a new language. Au revoir bonne journ√®√® :)
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Overall nice app but sometimes gives you practise without actually teaching you something previously. For example, the app doesn't give you a comprehensive explanation or a tutorial on case conjugations, and then you get a practise in which you have to use case conjugation. Then when you get it wrong you lose a life. E.g. Fill in the blank: –í ____ –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∂–∏–≤–æ—Ç–Ω—ã—Ö (–∑–æ–æ–ø–∞—Ä–∫, –∑–æ–æ–ø–∞—Ä–∫–∞, –∑–æ–æ–ø–∞—Ä–∫–µ). Exactly how is a person trying to learn Russian supposed to know this without any tutoring? Guessing?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,nice app. Pretty straight forward and no paywall. Been using it for a year or two now. I like how the lessons feel like games and that you gather XP that you use to rank up higher and higher against other people and also the addition that you can add friends to help each other out by giving XP boosts and just reminding them to keep learning. Can't wait to receive the new maths and music update.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Not sure why but I can never start the app on the first try. Always have to launch it once, kill it, then launch again before I can enter the app. I also feel the sound detection is really wonky and unreliable. But it's fun & easy way to learn an introduction to a new language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A Fantastic Language Learning Experience with Duolingo! I've been using Duolingo for several months now, and I'm absolutely impressed with its effectiveness in language learning.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Came here to give a detailed explanation, I'll just leave this here - Duolingo, your ""explanation"" within the app, how the paid version will be charged, is totally different than what happens on Play Store. You trick people into thinking they will be charged monthly, but once you come to the payment part, you get billed with the annual price. Shameful and against good advertisement practice! Should I say, scam!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"As an app Duolingo is fantastic *IF* you can access it. As a paid subscriber, I have no customer service support after getting logged out of the app. There is no phone number. Support emails go unanswered. Automated emails provide broken links that do not load. I am locked into paying $120 annually for an app I cannot access and have no customer support. I have been trying for two months to get a hold of someone with no response."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm gonna be completely honest. When duo switched everything around and I hated it, absolutely hated it! I wrote a very angry review b/c i felt like I was finally focused and making progress! I had a 250 day streak and I felt defeated. I'm almost at a 600 day streak and I've managed to get even further with the new layout than I ever did with the old one- I'm comfortable enough to actually speak in the languages I've learned now."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4 stars.. i do absolutely love it and am learning super quick. i have paid for the full version.. which i absolutely recommend. however.. i give 4 stars out of 5 only because you are tossed into sentences with new words without working on the words to learn first which for me makes it a bit difficult. i would love to have the words with photos or even words with the meanings to match before being tossed into sentences so i can learn them before having to try to understand the sentence first.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The fact that you can choose as many language as you can and it's free, for me it's a no brainer. Duolingo has some languages I want to study which are not available in other language programme. If you have already chosen other language learning programme, you should still add Duolingo to enhance your learning with additional practices and learning tools."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app does NOT allow questions and disabled the comments section. I'm an adult learner and I find blocking this feature is condescending. The new learning Tips are not that helpful either. Yes app is FUN, widget gives practice reminders, approaches learning from different angles: listening, speaking, writing/ translating what you hear,reading stories & comprehension of short phrases to answer questions. I like ""Learning Hub"" where I can focus on either practice my speaking or listening."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've been practicing with Duolingo for more than a year now. It is a fantastic app to learn a new language. The gamified techniques help build the habit of practicing daily. There are many different levels of exercises that one can cover with adequate repetition and variety.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is awesome for learning languages. I have a suggestion for duolingo there should be an offline option so you can download lessons and use them offline like if you have a daily streak and your going on a plane to somewhere and your streaks about to end you should be able to do the lessons off-line and also so you never miss a great lesson of learning
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the app except for two things: sometimes exercises are repetitive and I automatically respond based on the memorization of the correct answers I gave before rather than thinking about the answer. And I also am disappointed that there's nothing for Persian speakers, while there are so many persian users on the app. There needs to be courses for those who only speak Persian, and also courses on the Peesian language itself. I was trying to get my mom on the app but she only speaks persian."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been using the app for over a year to learn a language now, and whilst the majority of it has been functional, there are some large flaws. There are a lot of structural flaws in the sentences, things which are not said in a natural way, and the speaking exercises are impossible to get, regardless of how close you are on pronunciation Far worse is the recent removal of gboard support, an accessibility feature which I rely upon to make typing on a phone screen possible"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Daily Refresh became useless recently: it goes over the same ~10 topics every time, while the course has a lot more. There's a fresh bug. 1) Start the last lesson of Daily Refresh before midnight, and finish it after midnight. 2) Next day this 6th lesson will be unavailable as if already completed. That's a pity: in all other scenarios it's the lesson starting time that counts."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"There is no longer a button to access comments. This would make up for some of the wrong translations or grammar, by seeing corrections. It's gone now and we're stuck with the garbage. For the Japanese module, there are still many issues in regards to the translations. More voice acted stories would be wonderful."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Great app but sometimes the translations are wrong (I'm a native speaker of the language my child is learning) 2. There doesn't appear to be any way to turn off in-app purchases. My son has accidentally bought gems 4 times now as he just clicks on it. At the very least make it a 2-3 stage process to purchase. He's 6. 3. There is no customer service when things go wrong.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good for learning Italian but honestly they need to communicate what variant of the word you need to use more clearly. I had to translate and type in the missing word in a sentence as part of my unit 1 review, and I tapped on the English word at the top and see ""libera"" and underneath it was the word ""libero"" so it made me think that ""libera"" was the correct translation for the word since it was above ""libero"" but NOPE. you guys need to communicate what variant is correct a bit clearer please"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've loved using Duolingo for the last several years, I always recommend it. But for some reason as of late, the widget doesn't update to remind me to do a lesson. I've lost 3-4 freezes just to keep my streak going because of it. Is there a bug in the widget? I've removed it from my home screen and readded it, but to no avail."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I grew up speaking Spanish, having learned it as a 2nd language, beginning at age 8. Since finishing high school over 50 years ago, I've not had anyone to speak it with, so I've forgotten a lot. Some is coming back to me since using this app. Many of the words for things are different from the ones I'd learned. Some are words I'd never encountered before. I learned this app teaches Spanish as from Spain. Being in Texas, I'd learned Mexican Spanish. This is expanding my Spanish vocabulary MUCHO!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The App continually fails to open and gets stuck on one screen. The only way to get it to open is to restart my phone. This is becoming more frequent to the point I'm considering getting rid of the App all together. Had this not been an issue I may have scored it higher.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I like this app. I think it teaches me alot. However, after each exercise the app freezes and I have to restart the app. It doesn't remember things I just accomplished. Honestly there are just too many bugs with this app. Too bad too because I believe it could be really good for me."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"One of Best apps for begginers. There is one slight problem maybe in Italian section. As I'm learning Italian there are some parts that tell you to input what you here such as loto or casa. But, when you complete them, it doesn't tell you what the word actually means. I have to go to the word menu to figure out what it means. Please fix this, otherwise would have gotten a five star."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Beware! It's addictive!!!! I am brushing up on 4 languages I took in school years ago. I easily play for an hour a day because it's so fun. The ads in the free version are short and one after each lesson. Pretty awesome for free language lessons! I just wish they offered Malti. Just wanted to add that I upgraded to the paid version because I am returning to college & want to place out of foreign language classes. So far, Super is amazing!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I did rate this app really highly until the rapid review and match madness extras were added to units. These are seemingly impossible to complete without buying cheats. I already have the paid version of Duolingo and really resent this extra cash grab from them. I won't be renewing and will actively recommend people look elsewhere.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love it so much! I love the use of AI, and the widget inspires me to continue my streak. The repetition technique, social and competitive community, and reward systems help me keep on track and feel accomplished. I would put a five star. However, Duolingo does not have Te Reo(NZ). It would be greatly appreciated if it were to be an option. This app has excellent, inspiring techniques of social interaction and communication of education. I would love to re-learn the language with this appüëÄü•∞üôè"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app. I haven't used it in 5 years (since I last travelled somewhere for another language), they've made it more fun. Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is I don't like how they make you pay for it now (for features that were free in 2019), and $14.99/month is pretty steep. it's a bit much."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very good for a free app. Could use some flexibility with certain languages. I understand that strict adherance to the conventions of one dialect is better for new learners, but it can be a hindrance for people just looking to practice a language they already know, when the particular dialect they speak is unavailable."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I have been learning languages on Duolingo since April 25th 2023... The first 7-8 months went smoothly... But later it started asking me to update to Super Duolingo... I updated it because I liked Duolingo alot... But recently when new new updates started coming in the management is changing the things we are learning in courses... I am a pro in Spanish and a beginner in Chinese... They are changing the path of courses and now I am finding much difficulty in learning languages...
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Why do I need to go though the exercise over and over again in different Units of a Section? This diminishes my enthusiasm of learning a new language. It begins to become boring and demotivating. With the best of intentions, I'd like to request the product owners of Super Duolingo to not make a user with somewhat above average grasping capabilities, suffer through the same exercises over and over again."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Very gimmicky for adults. I don't really understand about collecting hearts etc and didn't realise you need these to progress. Pace too slow for me but I get stuck at a certain level due to not bothering collect hearts. Annoying music in the background of one exercise I did today so not good if you are hard of hearing which I am. American English not ideal e.g. the word 'smart' for 'clever'. Seems to be geared more to children than adults. Please could you devise an adult oriented app?
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"OUTSTANDING! even the (ACTUALLY) FREE version is GREAT very well made app in supremely well thought & created program naturally has you engaged & even taking new steps w/o you always realizing it ,BAMyou just translated a sentence w/ 2 new words I love how you can tap the words and get extra info really helps you to see the versatility of each word or pronoun etc in an easy to absorb way >> very very impressed and having a lot of fun learning French DEFF 5 STARS PS WORTH THE UPGRADEwellDoneDuo"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Somewhat good for learning languages, but is INCREDIBLY infuriating. If the algorithm screws up and marks your sentence as incorrect you lose a heart even though you did nothing wrong, if this didn't happen often or if we didn't only have 5 hearts, this wouldn't be an issue. But as is, this minor flaw makes me despise using this app. Additionally, speaking exercises dont work sometimes, but I lose a heart because of technical difficulties."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"it's not really a learning app, it's more like a videogame. it is only useful for practice if you already know at least some of the language. I liked it better before, when you could choose what topic you wanted to practice. what's more, there are tons of ads and annoying videos and animations."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is very simple and easy early on. Hopefully, there will be more useful content later on in the lessons, as none of what I've learned is conversationally effective yet."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The updates that have been made to the app in recent years have removed the grammar tips and lessons. It makes it a lot harder to properly understand the language and is a big step backwards. The app feels more ""streamlined"" now, but at the expense of content that is vital to language learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is certainly a good starting point for learning a language. It would be nice to be able to go over old lessons to really catch the words or to have the same level with different sentences to become more confident about the sound and structure of the sentences. I liked it enough to buy the pro version for$60. I tried to get the family duolingo so that I could invite my wife but, bizarrely, it refused to let her join. I wrote an enquiry but no reply as yet. I still regard it as a good app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Sensational app - the exercises are fantastic. I've been using it for only 9 days and have already learnt basic German. The exercises are not only designed to continuously teach you new words and sentences, but it also continuously refers back to things you have already learnt to keep them fresh in your mind and help you remember."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"the speaking modules are random - I've deliberately missed out words and been correct, I've correctly repeated the phrase and been wrong! I've had the noise to say I got the phrase wrong, but the green correct message and l can move on!! Baffled by it! Apart from that, it's a fun way to kill a few mins."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Its ok. Helps you learn basic sentences. but itll definitely not get you fluent. I miss old duolingo when it didnt have this ""super duolingo!"". Paying for hearts, really? Its literally, ""whoops! You made too many mistakes! Thats too bad. You can either A, buy more hearts, or B, practice one whole lesson for only ONE! not to mention you have to leave the current lesson, not saving any progress and you have to start over. And if you have a trial of super, we wont even tell u before it expires!!"""
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app's filled with bugs! Sometimes when I make two consecutive mistakes the number of hearts automatically jumps from 3 to 0 amidst the lesson! I don't know if that's intentional to force me into buying the super version but honestly it is so effing annoying. Overall this app's experience is not smooth or easy at all.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's a great app to learn the basics of a language but the further you get the worse it becomes. The start is very fun but nowadays I've been recieving many bugs were my duolingo shortcut was showing that I had completed my daily lesson but then at 10 oclock I get a notification that the streak is about to end. Please fix this thank you.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App is designed to scam users out of coins. I just lost over 1800 coins during Match Madness without any notification of cost. The app has very poor computer generated audio which often does match native speakers. Hints are often either wrong or non-existent. I used this app for almost a years with no progress whatsoever. I don't recommend buying the app, or use it to learn language. The app oriented for gaming, not learning"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Generally quite a good and well presented set of language courses. Gamification and building a learning community of friends helps encourage continued use. My only gripe is about the English side being USA English and a lot of the use of US terms such as an insistence that 'football' in different languages means soccer, weight is measured in pounds when no-one outside the USA and some old Brits use that term and people wear pants rather than trousers or strides. They need a USA English course"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like that I can learn with Duolingo for short time periods, however I don't think it explains Grammar rules well, particularly as you advance and the language becomes more complex. There is no way to recap on those rules from within a module as you need it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app, the experience is great. I like the interface and the way the process is build. You get rewarded for practicing every day, there is ""competitivness"" with the league. And you can practice all the skille you might possibly need."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. i have recommended it so many times to other people. it teaches you to read, write and speak at the same time. Negatives I removed a star for three reasons. 1. The hearts take very long to refill 2. The chests are underwhelming. 3. The amount of gems used for special exercises are a lot in comparison to the amount of gems received. It's demotivating. 4. The highest league is diamond, which you get demoted from. Theres no peak."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a app that helps you learn any languge you want. It teaches you in an enjoyable way. Duolingo tests both your listening, speaking, and reading skills to your desire language. Once you put it to practice, not only on the app, but also in real life, you will see improvement with the knowlage that Duolingo gives you. Duolingo also sends you reminders everyday to make sure that you stay on track. Duolingo is a best friend, when it comes to your language goals."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Recently had an update on my Chinese course content and now I have a ton of new words from earlier units that I've not learnt! Now I have to go back and go through each lesson again to cover knowledge gaps :( Not fun when you feel you've been making progress and now getting stuck with long ads between each lesson!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I came back after several years to re-learn Russian and am surprised they finally added the Cyrillic lesson (last time they added it in the community forum, and now the forum is gone...?). Been practicing the letters for several days, and I can say I now can read them better. Haven't been to the real lesson though, so can't say much about vocab learning aspect. The best part of the app is simply the widget feature, with lots of illustrations to encourage daily learning. All in all, great app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Easy to follow but uses American English, and is teaching me Mexican Spanish - would be good to have the choice for Spain Spanish (there is a difference, and not one mention of Pounds ¬£ or Euros but lots of dollars, pesos!) and don't correct my English (it's football not soccer, get over it). Occasionally says words & have to guess spelling because never been shown before, assume this is to train the ear but being failed rather than taught is an odd way to do it. And too many Duo ads for premium"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall, Duolingo is an excellent app for learning languages. I am learning Japanese, and it helps me learn the kanji and Japanese characters, not just the actual language. My only complaint is that Japanese (and maybe some other languages too) don't have speaking exercises which really annoys me. Also, occasionally, the animation will break, which might only be my problem, but I do hope that duolingo can fix it anyway. However, on the whole, I think Duolingo is a great app for learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I can't say I've seen the full capabilities of what Duolingo can teach, but even the free version feels like it is worth your time at least as a beginner of a language. The ads are short and since progress can only be stopped with mistakes, it gives you a good time to reflect."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app for learning and I would definately recommend but it requires you to be online and that sometimes plays an inconvience if you want to learn while offline, I understand they need to make money somehow but that really causes people to back away from the app, also when I opened the app recently my streak freeze would be used, even though the day prior I had done a lesson and it moved my streak up was that just a glitch or is something else wrong with the app? Please fix this thanks"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very good at teaching grammar from the get go (as someome learning french) and an adorable, modern interface. of course more repetitiion would be ideal, but you can go over lessons as much as you want, and earn a plethora of rewards. Not to mention that you can learn uncommon and fictional languages, like zulu and klingon respectively! Awesome."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The time on XP Ramp Up Challenge on Level 3 is way beyond ridiculous hard at this point. Especially when it comes to the +40XP part, the time is getting reduced to like 1:30. And when you can't finish it when the time is up, you have to spend more on gems to extend the time. And if you don't want to spend it, you could literally just end the session."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm learning Japanese, but if you want to know why you get an exercise wrong, look elsewhere (like Busuu). The ""guidebook"" gives you key phrases (to memorize) rather than actual explanations of grammar or advanced sentence structure. Additionally, within a year I hadn't practiced (I ended a 376 streak back in 2022), the beginning lessons seem to think that knowing ""a cool lawyer"" is more important to know than ""he"" or ""she"". I mostly use it for learning to write Kanji now."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Very little grammatical information - you need to work out the rules from errors. Some of the listening exercises make you choose the correct word. No idea/ information about the word means. The Android and iPhone apps are different.

I got dropped out of the diamond league and paid 2000 diamonds to stay in there but it won't let me stay! Second, what's wrong with the animation?? I checked the settings if I turned off the animation but nope, it wasn't because of the settings. The animation is quite off. Please fix"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great way to learn different languages and I am looking forward for new updates! Update: since they added music and math I haven't accesses it even though the app is up to date I've tried everything I checked the language learner thing but it doesn't show so I think this is the biggest bug that Duolingo has so I will be waiting to fix this bug or the music and math sets are only on IOS and I don't have IOS so I'll be waiting to make them add both music and math soon on Android for Android users.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app has improved in speed, and now has speed drills in every unit, so that I can focus my practice where I think I need more. I wish that I could bank the 15 minute double points windows, to use when I am free, the way that the app lets me bank the 30 minute double points window for completing the friends' quest."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The ads for Duolingo plus are very long. Because of this I shut down the app. They certainly don't make me want to pay for Duolingo plus. I just don't use it as often. Update.....I hate the new update As I've progressed through the levels any explanation, either from Duolingo or from peers in the comments section of each lesson has disappeared. Because of this I'm unsure if Duolingo is simply incorrect or if I'm doing something wrong. It previous correct answers are now wrong. Help us out."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I miss the old Dou, I am using it to dust off some old skills. But yikes I might be better off with a book and Google translate. Feels like the app is centered around memorization in lieu of explanations."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The blocking animations after every single lesson are a waste of our time. Speech detection ain't what it used to be Often gets stuck and fails to detect the first few words again and again even when speaking the language perfectly. Seems to be some sort of glitch, results in lost hearts and less practice."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The lessons are great, but you definitely need to supplement your learning elsewhere. There's a fair bit of grammatical/usage errors that hopefully will be hammered out over time. Regardless, an amazing way to introduce yourself to a language in a gameified way."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo has changed a lot in the years that I've used it, and I'm very happy and satisfied with its progress. I've been doing Spanish on and off, but now I'm sticking with it, and I'm going strong. Depending on how dedicated you are, if you are really going for learning another language, it's worth the investment to do the one time payment of the lifetime premium. it's a lot less headache, a lot more forgiving, and a lot less of a wait between lessons. it honestly made me stick with it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is getting slower and slower. It used to be quite reactive to pass from one menu to another now it's really sluggish. And when I launch a lesson it can take up to 30s to have the first exercise, even more if it's an audio exercice, it takes a lot of time before I can hear anything."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"this is such a cool app. I downloaded it yesterday, and it always gives friendly reminders. I've always seen so many bad reviews on YouTube, but I've seen nothing wrong with it. it's also good for future plans, like moving to a new state like Mexico or France. This app will help you learn a new language so you can communicate with other people in other languages. so yeah, I highly recommend this app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I was notified that my progress was synced with the new Japanese course content which came a few updates ago, but when I go back to review finished sections for practice and legendary I find that there is a lot of new content there. I was going to give three stars. The extra one is for what you did with kanji."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The time trial levels (those where you can earn up to 3 stars) are intentionally near impossible to master. It's obviously a cash grab to spend the premium currency. I let 4 of my native speaking friends (Spanish) try the first 5 time trials. None of them could achieve 3 stars. And yes, they were very fast. The last tasks always ask you to write what you hear. Nobody can write that fast. You have to be very lucky to get more regular tasks, or you have to spend money to extend the time. Cashgrab"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Changed my 5 star rating to 3 star only because of the ads. This app was one of my top recommendation for those who want to learn other languages for free. With good app interface and interesting methods of teaching,this app wins it all. But,with the recent updates the app started showing ads to promote their super Duolingo,which is their premium verison(of course ). So no, I won't recommend this app anymore and can be only changed if they remove their ads. üëéüëéüëé"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have fully completed the duolingo hindi course. What I have found is that my reading is almost perfect, but I have not gained a good use of vocabulary. I did not even know the word 'goodbye.' Whenever I try to do 'daily hindi lessons', they never give me anything useful. I have forgotten the word salty, for these 'revision' sessions to say things like 'Neha cannot sing better than grandmother.' These are things I wish for Duolingo to improve on. Thanks."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great tool for introducing yourself to a language and getting familiar with the basic concepts. You aren't going to be fluent in a year, or conversational in a month, but it's a great way to get to the point in a language where you can start listening to and processing the language at speed, at which point you can basically google translate the rest of the way. I generally am against the kind of ""slot machine"" mechanics used here, but it is actually a great motivational tool in this case."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I want to leave a shining review, I really do but I can't. The quality of the courses has gone down since they switched to AI translators instead of actual people. It's unnoticeable until the higher levels and then the translations just make no sense anymore. I love duo but I gotta move on to actually learn anything."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a great app for learning because it definitely involves all the things that you need; recall, writing, movement, listening, speaking üó£Ô∏è ... My one gripe is that the lessons teach you really odd stuff in the beginning! The beginning lessons of Portuguese/German involve animals... Can I get some directions? Or perhaps food? Basic lessons should be common things, no learning how to say ""owl or monkey!"""

Now I don't know if I am learning correctly ittalian because polish for sure is not correct, For example- I said ""ty idziesz"" (you are walking) and ot said ots WRONG? I'm 100% sure I know a language which I've been speaking for my whole life better than an app. OUTRAGEOUS! No one could learn true information from it"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a fun app. It makes learning easy. You can get a good amount of teaching in using the free version. I'm not sure how I feel about the ""heart"" system that is in place when making mistakes, but I'm sure that's how they convince people to upgrade. But overall, it's fun and enjoyable, while at the same time teaching you a new skill so I would definitely recommend it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is more like a game than learning. I actually know more Spanish than I thought I would remember from classes taken 25+ years ago. The lessons are easy, and build on previous lessons, so the next steps are intuitive, rather than hard."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is an amazing app! I would give it a 10 if I could, its the best language learning app (its free too!), they dont advertise their pro version to much, they use simple motivational tactics to learn more and their learning tactis really work, they also have an amazing marketing team on social media ü´°. Thank you for making this app, I would love if you could add a Croatian course and maybe either a ASL course or make a separate Duolingo app for ASL? Would that be possible?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The best app in the world! I love Duo and it's ""lingo"" aspect and here's why. A good thing about it is that you can learn any language you want for free. Another fantastic feature is game-like learning and the strike. They really give me huge sense of achievement. The only problem are, of course, hearts. It's shame that you can do so little in free version daily. All in all, I would recommend the app to literally everyone. Even people not interested in languages can learn one here quite well! 5!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Greek... good at first?. gets very annoying quickly. Too many useless phrases! eg ""I give the glass to the elephants"". Teach me to order food, buy things, count to more than 1!, ask for directions and help. Stuff that is useful when visiting Greece!!! Allow me to abort rubbish modules? Many of the units don't build in any coherent way. Numbers are taught randomly. The speaker talks too fast and not clearly. Very disappointing!! And as an app, the maths for XP's is atrocious."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been learning Japanese, and so far it's been a really fun experience. Even if you're really busy it's usually pretty easy to find time even for just one lesson because they're so short, and the way you gradually build up knowledge of terms and grammar seems to me to be pretty well designed, plus the leaderboards and rewards add a little extra motivation and make it really fun. Definitely recommend"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo has a very good array of exercises - matching, multiple choice, fill in the blank, translate, dictation, and speech - with enough reviews that I don't forget earlier words and spellings.

Admins, please help as there are no contact information on the app itself. I'd like to continue with my lessons!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,introduced grammar naturally. forced you to use your imagination and retain your attention span by striving to win at a game. whereas you are really learning a new language . I liked that it assessed my level at the beginning to start me at a higher place. and learning speed.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is incredibly fun to use and has upgraded the features since I used it in previous years. Learning Japanese (with some prior knowledge) hasn't been the most straightforward. Learning begins with words and sentences before learning the individual symbols for Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji. Although a separate section exists to practice these... It's a fun way to learn and understand basic Japanese, but could be organised better to assist genuine and prolonged understanding of the language"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The whole idea is really great, helps a lot to remember simple phrases at A/B levels. But why did you remove discussions? Those chats were really helpful even just to read them, lots of useful information from other users. Now I need to go outside to other sources when need to clarify doubts about language use. Updated again on Feb 29 and now sound doesn't work in most of cases... Why are you trying to improve a great thing, you make it worse. To proceed with studies, I move to another app nowüò™"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The game is addicting and fun, Great dopamine hits. However the mechanics of language learning are not taught, they are inferred, and the words taught are not the most important words a new beginner should be learning. The dopamine wears off and you realize that after all this time your knowledge is pretty superficial."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I was disappointed that I got to the Diamond league, and the Quest tracker was inaccurate. I wrote to Duolingo, and it was not fixed.

No response, there is no one at customer service PERIOD. I want a refund and will be seeking class action legal counsel if not refunded soon.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I love this app but recently it's been plagued by bugs - voice recognition is very slow, it doesn't calculate collected points correctly constantly claiming that I don't earn enough points. I really hope they will release a new fixed version soon"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I would rate it 4 stars because the advertisement comein between the practice otherwise it is the best app because we can make friends and account on app. And I joined my friends it was fun to practice we enjoyed very much practicing and I am learning Korean and French and my best friend is learning we enjoy so much that we speak our languages fluently. And my teachers, my school, my parents, are very happy because I speak fluently and this is only because of duolingo. THANK YOU DUOLINGO"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have been studying French for 1 year.

Catchy and instructive"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good for learning the basics! Some of the earlier words and sentences could do with being more relevant, so you can use them in a normal conversation. That would help with people who want to learn a language quickly, so they can use what they've learnt while travelling."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have been learning Spanish and German for almost three months now every day. I feel like I am actually learning and making progress.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Easy, low friction way to start learning a new language.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Potential to be a great app but ruined on: 1. Gamified - too much focus on leaderboards and gathering xp, rather than learning the language, they want you to top up your gems / buy time boosters, why is an annual paid subscription not enough for you? 2. Support - I submitted a ticket over 2 weeks ago reporting a bug, still not heard anything back. 3. Arabic - too much focus on sound of the language rather than actual words, I've spent over 14 hours and been shown less than a handful of words."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,As my course continues it gets boring to do the language course on Duolingo Main thing I would say because of the thing that I should translate it into English Why can't I learn from German to German most of the time as the course progresses! Better you plan another way to go through the course faster so that it's not boring to do learn same words again and again. I need a different way to learn new words in Duolingo. I'm sure Duolingo helps remember words but this process is soooo slow.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,When you add the widget of the app to your home screen it gaslights you into believing that you did a lesson today. It just shows duo and the streak number but when I open the app and close it again then it shows the danger sign and asks to do a lesson. The widget was supposed to be a reminder for when you don't do a lesson instead it just ruined by new years resolution and I didn't do a lesson yesterday. Now I don't feel motivated to do it anymore.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a well-put-together language learning program for all levels. There are many languages to choose to learn, and students (Duolingo users) have opportunities to read about, and delve more deeply into the background linguistics of the language they are learning! The format of the app itself is also fun and easy to use! I fit the daily lessons into my nutty work and travel schedule easily. Highly recommend trying Duolingo! Thank you to all the staff who put this all together!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Ok, the app is nice, translations are accurate and lessons are fun and short enough for you to actually learn something off of the app, even if it won't make you a fluent speaker it'll lay the bases for a language for you, allowing you to learn at any source and pace afterwards, one bug tho, the 3 days super hasn't ended for me since a month which makes me feel like a thief ü§£"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good for free lessons. It would be easier to start off (Spanish) if they explained when to use each tense rather than expecting the learner to pick up the pattern. My 7yo enjoys doing lessons with me, so it has been a good experience."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Used to be excellent. Recently, the app doesn't always record my progress, meaning I lost rewards to a streak freeze even though I completed the work. This has happened since Duolingo replaced many of their human workforce with AI. Such a shame, glad I only pay by watching adverts!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The app over-all good but there are two things that bother me very much. 1 The character Zari in my Japanese course prounces ‚Äòwa‚Äô as 'to'. I reported it but it's still not fixed 2 The second and most important thing is that Duolingo skips my listening lessons entirely every time when there is a quest specific to them. Please team Duolingo i urge you to fix this

At that time, there weren't so many advertisements and didn't need to use gems to take extra or legendary lessons. Everything has been changing now and, pardon me, I am getting annoyed by this."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It is a great app and very useful when you want to learn a new language. When I first go it I wasn't sure how much I'd use it because I never liked learning languages in school but I use it almost every day and it is so much more fun. Something that annoys me though is that it is in American English for English speakers and I am from Britain. I know there aren't many differences but they are some and I get confused when I see a word I recognise but it means something else in American English.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Doesn't have the language I wanted to learn so I picked another for fun. The app so far has been nice to use, the advertising half the time is for the app's premium which is preferred. Its notifications are annoyingly persistent, but not quite spammy. Good stuff."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"the exercises are not done in a practical way, with language and conversations that would be useful in real life. the German language I'm learning, needs to teach the gender specific words and more specifically, exactly when and why they're used...most of the time it's just guesswork to figure out what gender words to use and when...do better, Duolingo"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"App works good and is very helpful for the most part, but for some reason when the time runs out on the timed challenges, the screen dims, but nothing happens, and the only thing that works is to close the app, which doesn't save the progress"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo started off as fun but the more I play, the more I realize that I can go forward in the game if I already know the language, otherwise it's extremely frustrating because it's a guessing game and after every mistake, I lose a heart. Also, if I'm marked wrong, there is no explanation as to WHY. The worst part of Duolingo are the WOKE sentences that contradict the Holy Bible...and I'm FORCED to write them or I can't pass!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I like Duolingo a lot. It has been working alright for years. But this new update is a bit off.

Then I cancelled the subscription which won't renew due a year and Google won't allow me to delete my CC because they say it has to remain to renew the Duo. What a scam."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it always keeps you motivated, and this is honestly my favorite way of learning a new language, not having to be forced from college classes, or other work, and can just have some time to learn a language that can make you feel proud, and you can talk to other people that speak that language, and I honestly adore all of the little cartoon people that just makes my day better."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really decent for a free program. it can be glitchy and the translations are sometimes off but, again, free. would be nice, and would make it worth paying for, if there were even basic explanations about the grammar."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo has helped me throughout my journey to learning French for a trip to France. Duo, the bright colored bird, uses fun ways and tricks to help me learn how to talk, write, and read French! Duolingo also has a bunch of other characters and challenges that make it fun. You can earn achievements and win in an event by moving up tier levels. Duolingo also provides premium edition with unlimited hearts, better guided learning, and unlimited mistakes at a cheap price. Duolingo has made a impact."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love how fun and easy Duolingo makes learning a new language, only complaint is I wish if you kept making a mistake on the same words it would give you a separate lesson to help differentiate and understand those words better. All in all still a great app and very helpful."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Duo uses the old-fashioned approach to language learning with main accent to grammar. If you need to pick up some basic language for traveling, it's getting more ad more useless with every lesson... And it also has quite a lot of bugs lately"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,this is a perfect app for me to learn languages. duolingo can teach us languages easily and with clarity. there is a leader boad to encourage learners to earn more points. there are also other fun activities and journeys that can teach us I different ways. I recommend this app for all young learners.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Amazing learning system. Really motivates me to learn a few minutes effectively every day. But please, kindly explain, as a Portuguese learner why need i know the word for armadilo long before i study basic questions for basic conversations? Another thing, will you support Portugal Portuguese (which i am interested in, but settle for Brazil Portuguese)?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am loving this app! I was recently with some friends who have a 5th grader taking French and I was thinking wow, I used to take French and Spanish in school but I have forgotten everything. she inspired me to take some lessons by app. so I tried this one and wow, simple, colorful, fun! Introduces stuff I need to know and reinforces it multiples ways and times. I want to try the pay version if I prove I will stick with it. for now...I love it and go me!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really like the format. The learning is fun and engaging. The lessons include matching words, speaking words, translation, writing. it is very useful to use several skills to help cement the words and concepts."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The streak timing is set to Nth America, so even I'd I practice every day, I seem to lose my streak. I'm in Australia. it's quite annoying, as this is a big part of the psychology of morivarion employed by the app. I typically have to practice right before sleep and at lunch to avoid losing my streak! why don't they set it based on location!?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Simply the best app to learn a new language. I always wanted to learn German, but I could not make any significant progress before. Now I'm on a 450 day streak, doing one or two lessons a day and this helps me keep learning new words, remembering sentence structures and more. Besides, it's fun!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very demanding to complete everyday tasks and isn't set up to learn the necessary tools to completely learn the language, also from personal experience, I think the girl in pink speaks to fast on the sentences you can't slow down and it's easy to miss small words especially when learning Spanish and there are small letters like o and a"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've only had the app for 1 day so far and it has made learning Spanish and German easy! It will have me find out what words mean, then give me small sentences or phrases and try to translate them. Sometimes it will have me repeat a sentence in the language I'm learning to make sure I can say it right. I just downloaded it last night and I already got through a few lessons because it makes learning other languages so easy!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love it, it is so easy too use and completely free you have a choice for a plan, or not. Edit: I have to give it three stars for only one reason, the Duolingo app doesn't have Latin America Spanish, which is completely different from Spain Spanish, and I hope that Duolingo adds this language to their app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's ultimately a good way to learn a language/ languages BUT it marks names wrong even if you spell it wrong ( This happened to me, it was one where you had to click on a sound button and spell it out I had never seen the name Louis in the game (that's how I spelt it but it was supposedly Luis & same with Ana/Anna) Personally this is all in all a good game I hope you get on well üòú"

Im now learning french because Im going to emigrate and this has been such a great help!! I would just like to leave a sugestion. It would be great if the app have some teoric part, where it would explain gramar, for example. I feel like, at the same time that Im using the app, I have to be using other platform to understand why I made a mistake. It would be great to have that explanations inside the app! Thank you üôå"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Generally the application is very good. But I'm studying Hebrew and all the forth and fifth section is consist of the same sentences and tasks. That's too weird. I guess it's a bug. There are too many tasks and word that I don't remember, but they do not appear at all."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"as someone that learned french in school, the lessons make it so easy to grasp and remember. i love how the lessons are short and quick and repetitive enough to learn the fundamentals. it has only been about a week and I already feel more comfortable than I have ever been üòå‚ú®Ô∏è 5 star rating üí´"

Today is 25 November and again I am unable to open duolings. 2nd time this week - so yet again I will uninstall and try to install. And no communication from duolinga with this ongoing problem. It seems management is not at all interested in good customer service. Today is 9 decembre and again cannot open the app. So yet again no communication from management. Have downloaded memrise with no issues.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Easy to follow, repeats a lot, BUT usually the same words. I would like to practice more vocabulary. Also, when I use the option for slow speech, ""micro"" pops up when it is not a part of the normal speech"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app. Easy to use with lots of fun incentives to help keep you interested and feeling accomplished. Even using the free version offers so much that I don't mind watching the ads to help support this (which are only at the end of the lessons)
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a very good free app for learning new languages I have found it useful to help revising. You will have to put up with adverts and repetitive marketing of the premium version so if that annoys you this app isn't for you.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love Duolingo! it's helped me so much with my Spanish. it's super convenient because I can do as much or as little as I want each day. I also like that it's teaching me practical stuff so I can talk to people as opposed to just listening a ton of grammer rules.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I really used to like Duolingo. Well, today, a year later, I am completely pissed off. Yesterday, Monday, I complete the day goals and I am still not on the leader board. I do one more lesson and I got added but no credit for all the work done before. I am bailing out. Time to look for properly designed app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,okay but too much emphasis on exact grammar. I speak other foreign languages and perfect grammar is not important to be understood. A strong vocabulary and comprehension is more important unless you aspire to be a translator. Think how often text messages are incorrect yet you still understand the message most of the time.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"From someone that's been using Duolingo for free for the last 6 years. If you're just starting out, this has got to be one of the most painful ways to learn another language. You can do it, but you have to stomach the fact that the company is for profit and will make the experience very uncomfortable if you're not willing to pay. Like 15 (30 second) video ads a day uncomfortable while blacklisting ai features and debt cycling there in game currency to do anything other then the main lesson board"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Duolingo, I recommended it to many friends and family. BUT..... The new UI is so disappointingüò≠. After 1079 day streak, and two days with the new UI, I became a bit unmotivated. Please please please, give us back the old UIüôè"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is great and helpful app, with very good languages courses. There is mini problem with our comments, after about 50 comments on an achievement, the comments aren't visible. I figured out that it's not only me who faces this problem. Can you pls fix it. Thank you."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Now that tips are gone the Russian course is basically useless. You can only hope to memorize sentences and when you get something wrong there is no explanation of why your answer is wrong. My progress is totally crippled and I'd rather just try another service.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,it is an awesome app to learn languages and be competitive with people! the only thing that annoys me is that there are a bunch of ads convincing you to get super Duolingo. But I totally recommend the app!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have only used Duolingo for a little bit, but the way that it works just makes me so happy. I love being able to learn a language and compete with others on a leaderboard, and have it be like a game. Aside from that the actual teaching is amazing to I am having so much fun learning ItalianüòÉ"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A consistently fantastic app since its initial release. Our whole family uses it in a variety of languages and loves it. Four stars for the pointless fake ad pushing and the gem ""pay wall"" when trying to close out sections on legendary level."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm getting tired of the updates that reorganize my lessons. Words or phrases that used to be in lesson 1 and made more sense to start learning a language with have now moved to section 2 and include other words that I have not learned yet. And the beginning lessons are now topics that don't make any sense to start with. Please stop rearranging the lessons, it makes it hard to actually learn when things get moved around so much. I used to have fun, now it's just frustrating."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's been more than 100 days since I started duolingo and I'm so glad it became part of my daily routine. Kinda sucks that I lost my streak before when I took a vacation and broke my phone. Still, this app is a very fun way of learning another language. Worth purchasing!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a bit odd. Apparently many people in France have pet owls and horses. Could do a better job with verb conjugations and travel-relevant phrases. Constant push to buy, and too many annoying notifications regarding competing with others. ""You dropped out of the top 7!"" Big effing deal"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo: Fun, addictive language learning! Gamified lessons make learning German enjoyable (hours fly by!). Free with rare ads, offers core features. Paid option removes ads, unlocks offline lessons. Great for beginners or anyone seeking a fun language learning experience. (Disclaimer: No kidnapping involved...yet!)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app, but sometimes I get stuck on a question where I can't click on the green button to go to the next question. It's very frustrating as I'm spending diamonds to do the gold lessons but when it happens I have no choice to quit, resulting in the loss of my 100 diamonds."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love how this app teaches a language using reading, writing and audio. My sister used it first. She lived it so much she got the paid version and has learned Turkish. She watches tv in Turkish now and loves it. She also is learning another language now. I can't wait to finish this course to start on another language. I am using the free version."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Bit of a random order to learn in, early days though. Few inconsistencies between lessons for same words. might be better to have a short explanation on occasion , e.g. if wrong answer or multiple translations for same word. not confident enough in the process to buy yet."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"A little overrated app I have been using Duolingo daily for four months Am I learning some Spanish? Somehow. Am I understanding why to use a certain verb instead of another? Absolutely not. Lots of gaps, no grammar whatsoever, the app uses the same words on and on (gato=cat, got it) When moving to the next unit the learning flow changes drastically without logic. Apparently I am legendary in using Spanish in the past.ok then! Anyway, this app is fun, it's a cool game, but it's overrated"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is such an iconic app at this point, and surprisingly it does help me in school too. I also enjoy reading through the new posts and feeds ( they are definitely getting me to learn more than youtube). You can make mistakes but still learn without paying for premium, so don't worry."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a fun way to learn but I worry about my ability to actually speak the language I'm learning. I hate that when I fail a dialing exercise I get no feedback on what I actually did wrong. Furthermore, I'm not sure duolingo appreciates how French flows from one word to the next. Oh, and the vocabulary practice never includes gender, which is the part I need to practice most."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Originally Duolingo was a great platform, but in the last year and a half it became terrible. It looks that the team put gaming components ahead of learning tools. The feedback discussion disappeared along with grammar information. The practices became a joke.."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The ap is nice but on the one day challenges there is a glitch. I've done level 3/3 for 80xo over 4 times (30 gems a pop) and still don't get the credit for completing the challenge. Don't see how to contact the app makers to get those gems back or the credit for completing the challenge.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Could be better, too many words to learn at once and no real time to really understand the meaning of things and put it in correct context before moving on the next topic. Good recall of random words but not helpful for fluency. Would be good if it had a this is what you said and this is what it should say in the corrections so I can see where I have gone wrong, esp with same words that mean different things. Going over topics doesn't help if there's no explanation or context."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I see you've removed another feature in this newest update. Pretty soon you'll have removed everything and we'll just have a blank screen to stare at. I like to go back to old lessons and do practice to get the legacy unlocked. Now i can't do that and all of the lessons show as legacy being completed. A year ago you removed our ability to read sentence discussions (which you said you wouldn't do). And before that you removed offline downloadable lessons. I won't be paying for this ish again!!!!!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I edited this review to drop from 5 stars to one. I've been following the Japanese course for over 6 months and everything was very good. But after the last update I got jumped from section 2 unit 17 to section 3 unit 25 !! I don't understand half of it now. The app consider that I know it and there's no way for me to go back to where I left it... I was really enjoying it and would gladly edit this rating and review if this issue was fixed. Right now this is not even enjoyable anymore...
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Hey Duo your app is great the only thing I don't like is that we can't save our streak I know that's the whole point of a streak but still.I am going on a tour and we are not allowed to bring our phones so I can't continue with my lessons. If it's two days it's fine but three? I am really working hard on my streak and I don't want to lose it. So I'd say to make a system where you can save your streak for a couple days, but you need a good reason to."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to be a great app that fell to the need of constant expansion. Instead of focusing on improving understanding and complexity of language, they focused way more on finding ways to monetise it. And with the recent layoffs of their human translators to replace with AI, it's clear to me that the people in charge lack any idea of how language works (or AI for that matter) or any desire to improve the quality of its app. Also the written out greek pronounciations are plain wrong. Audio is ok tho"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good for pracice, no proper teaching of grammar or pronunciation. Grammatically translations can sometimes be a bit off in multiple languages also. Would also love to see different versions of languages, as for example the Spanish is south american Spanish only."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"ABSOLUTELY LOVING IT! Easy and fun, all sorts of stuff except bad things. Overall 10/10 in learning but a 9/10 in amount of languages, there wasn't Malay! I failed my malay exam, that's why I came here for help. Sadly no Malay, but atleast there's Chinese! It also just needs an ""Are you sure that it is correct?"" button. I accidentally pressed the wrong answer and made me get 88%. As an 11-year-old, I think Duolingo should add two question when we start: ""How old are you?"" and ""Learn your grade?"""
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"An app that gives you the right motivation to learn, and gives you a lit of ways to catch up depending on your skill level. It also provides financial assistance if you can't afford to go premium. Cute graphics too."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A fun and engaging way to learn a new language. I really enjoy all the challenges that encourage you to keep learning. But I don't like the idea of needing hearts to continue learning. The point of the app is to learn, but that's hard to do when you constantly need to buy hearts every time you make a mistake. Also, could you please add a place where you can view and revise all the words you learnt?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing the way it mixes the sentences up, and as you're progressing in lessons, it will throw in words you learned earlier. My only criticism is that you don't get to pick the dialect. I'm learning Vietnamese, and it's of the northern dialect when I want to learn southern. Also, there isn't enough opportunity to speak the language. It's mainly typing and listening which helps you understand the language, not speak it"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,very good language learning app. as of current to show my credibility I am on a 666 day streak and in diamond league (top league of duolingo) and have been for quite some time. I find that it covers all the bases needed for learning a language and the only bit that I don't think you'll learn from duolingo is the little nuances that come from learning from a native speaker. other than that I must say that duolingo is truly excellent to use.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it is a great great help, and it gives you a sense of accomplishment, I am learning a language for school purposes and I am going far making strides, awesome app. I highly recommend it, ignore the negative reviews, some people complain about minor things, I say that if you want results uiu must put the work in."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Was good. Then they changed the format of my entire lesson randomly one day. It jumped ahead a whole section and I wasn't able to go back and was completely thrown off course. Even after, they changed the previous unit format so I can't even review properly. There goes my 193 day streak."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I LOVE duolingo. It makes learning Languages fun! Normally at school, when we would learn Languages, I would get bored quickly but Duolingo makes it seem like a game! I have learnt many words in Japanese. I am following duolingo on tiktok and youtube and it makes it even more fun! I was happy to find out that Duolingo knows Jujutsu Kaisen. Duolingo is highly recommended!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Improperly used as a language learner, especially if you're trying to learn a language for the first time. Yes, yes, it teaches you the basics, but then it continues on and teaches only vocabulary. I'd like it if they added a proper conversational mode, but I suppose that won't come soon."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"very repetitive, does not seem to analyze your knowledge and make the exercises harder to make your progress faster. Easy to use while on the go, for example waiting in the airport"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The app is good BUT...your format should eliminate any and all use of 'romaji' in your Japanese language learning module. Romaji really has no practical use in Japan. During the Kanji practice the student is already exposed to the hiragana characters and should be drilling more matching those with the Kanji they are learning. To ask the students to type out phonetically the romaji for the Kanji being learned makes no sense and can actually stagnate the learning process. Eliminate romaji learning
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Hey I having been using duolingo to study German and currently I've the streak of 741 days. I found severe pronunciation errors in your exercises. Please make these pronunciation a little bit understandable and try not to add native accent. It is really annoying and difficult to understand. And please stop these ads.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great app üëçüèª I can easily learn any language i want. Not even a person can teach us like this app does. Especially it improves our speaking skills which are more difficult than learning writing it. Best way to utilise our time. Even spending 3-4 minutes a day will help you learn.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Such an amazing App. So well designed. leaning Italian from scratch and it's got me hooked. so far I've been able to breeze through the app without having to deal with the paid version yet. Kudos to the team for bringing such an amazing app to market.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's good but VERY American. They are obsessed by beans which I assume are Mexican. They keep on about purses whereas I have a handbag. The grammar is appalling. ""Are you going to write me"". I mean really!!! Then they split infinitives. The one major complaint.? If you are teaching Spanish use the language that the Spanish use. However I assume for commercial reasons this is directed at Americans who want to learn Spanish Overall at ¬£10 s month? Definitely worth it"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love Duo! I never knew learnin Italian would be a lot of fun. It's way better then goin to boring language classes lol. BUT the only reason way I'm giving this 4 stars is cuz I think having the leagues is completely non sense! All it's doing is making people more competitive n so instead of taking time to learn a language, people just speed run's through the lesson's just to get in the top 3 n not even learning the language that they r on."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"So I'm taking a highschool French class and we use duolingo in that class. It's like a side assignment to help us learn. Which it has been great at, not problems with the app itself. But whats annoying to me is that I change up my little avatar once. Only once, and now I can't do it again. Did they remove the feature? Do I have a setting I need to find? I don't know but I'm just kins of bummed about it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"BAD UPDATE CHANGE: The latest update has disabled the ability for keyboards to display the predictive text AND the voice to text options. This makes learning even more difficult as it increases simple smartphone typing errors. And, for example, when practicing Russian, forcing users to learn foreign keyboard layouts. This makes learning slow, tedious, and ANNOYING. Please revert this change ASAP!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best Learning Platform. We can learn any language by application. I have already learnt English from this and now I am a native speaker and do public speaking. Right now I am learning Korean just to use my time productively and when I started learning Korean I didn't know even the single letter of it and now I can build up different words and sentences or idioms or phrases. In this application we also get many rewards after achieving any achievement. As well as, in my opinion I never get bored."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have been using Duolingo for almost one year. Studying a bit of Spanish every day and so far I'm satisfied with my knowledge.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a fun language learning app,but it could use a bit of improving,like when they can set days where we dont open the app but the days we opened the app does not reset, like break days, for students they can fell upset if 7 days in one week they can only play at weekend which is the same case for me,which you can fix or add quickly, and they can add a settings for that we can dress duolingo with outfits when there are events like when cristmas or hallowen or maybe even at eid, bye now~"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is a cool learning app. but the problem is now it's asking us for money . I know that it was hard without Money but there is no point at it.i have been using Duolingo for several months but I think there is no need for it cus there are millions of people were using this app and they can earn alot of Money from it .so it's better if it was free like before. but from the other side Duolingo is really nice and it was fun also and it helps me alot so that was my opinion. thank you üòä
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely awesome in my opinion. They have tons of languages to learn and it's all free if you are okay with ads. Been learning Japanese on this app and it has very good education. And if you get the pro version, it's even better!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"There are almost constant issues with errorchecking, and it rigorously enforces learning only one dialect of Spanish, which is spoken in way less of the world than any other dialect. Sometimes it marks answers wrong because i left out a redundant 'nosotros'. I cant believe i spent so much time on this piece of garbage app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Well-managed content and easy to learn; you can learn any language you like. There are ads, but that is not a problem; you can simply close the ads very easily. That is the best part of the Duolingo app. And is there any grammatical mistakes simple ignore."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The speaking exercises never work anymore just keep buffering and not showing I spoke even though the mic is picking up my voice and I am saying it perfectly. I'd recommend Rosetta stone, babbel, pimsleur, or literally anything but this app at this point. Quality has gone so down hill its not even worth it anymore. As a developer myself this app is so poorly executed its embarrassing."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing,the best thing i know about this app is that after finishing a level they usually give a quiz; but my issue is related to that whenever you make a mistake it automatically declares that you lost a heart and you need more gem for that .In my opinion,this thing should not be supported if a language learner is new and he wants to learn that language very urgent I am giving it 4 stars due to this issue"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Unnecessary updates and too many animations made an amazing app very harf to use and impossible to enjoy. The app is overly gamified but it doesn't bring the gaming value neither the satisfaction. I spend more time switching off and closing the cringe animations than actually learning a foreign language.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I truly enjoy using Duolingo to learn Hebrew. one change is needed, Duo .. needs to ensure that the Hebrew keyboard is always when typing answers in Hebrew. Quite often it is not present, therefore you lose Leaderboard points, and flagged a answers as errors. There is no way to notify Duo.. that the keyboard is not present for use. Your answer is always flagged as wrong. I have Super Duo.."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's great to have free practice daily. However, the guidebooks should have the grammar rules explained. The language I'm studying has 7 cases and 3 genders - don't make me guess how to correct mistakes! Without addittional lessons from YouTubers, I would not be able to use this app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After reaching a 2000 day streak, I am confident in saying that Duolingo decreases in value every patch. Core functions have been removed. Forcing all users onto the path removed flexibility in learning. Removal of the community discussion hub, completely stifles learning opportunities. You can no longer find out if you've been poorly introduced to a grammatical edgecase, or a typo. Firing translators and replacing them with AI has lead to nonsense in lessons. Duolingo is now just a Skinner Box."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Sometimes, the lessons freeze, and the buttons don't work. I had to restart a lesson 4 times before getting through it. So far, I like the app though. I'm learning Japanese, and like that I'm finally learning hiragana."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Bllindly stumble on errors, repeat until success. Maybe learn on the way. Not a user friendly way! Doesn't teach grammar! Need a proper grammar book for that. They keep making app worse: user forum shutdown(only place for grammar hints), removed word list download (only way to learn words, use external apps). Gamification feature is terrible. Forces app use on given times,why? ChatGPT ftw! Also Rosetta Stone seems better. Superduolingo subscriber for 2 years (maybe no longer)."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I like it its helped me alot. I have an 11 day streak and my teacher that took Spanish in high-school is really impressed. But the downside to it Is the adds they don't pop up that much but when there is 1 add there is alot more. Hope this cab help you! I'm learning Spanish but you can learn alot more languages...Yes I prefer Dolingo more then Babble
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Overall it's a good app, but sometimes it gets buggy, like it doesn't add up my points. I just got about 200p for exercises today, but the points got stuck at the amount before I started, so I've lost time and points....üôÑ"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Using Duolingo is easy and fun. I wish it gave more information about verb tenses and when pronouns are required or not. Numbers and counting above 10 is not reviewed/taught together ( at least up to the level I am at. I have been using duolingo for over 100 consecutive days.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,app is glitchy at times and it seems to focus on teaching and repeating the same random phrases over and over again *edit* the app has gotten increasingly worse at recognizing voice. It's become a total waste. I regret buying the subscription
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It was an effective way to learn languages back when i first tried it years ago, but now every time you want to learn a language, instead of just hitting you with the basics like ""hello, how are you?"" or ""where are you from?"", it instead teaches you tourist-related phrases things like ""apple"" ""water"" ""salad"" ""one salad, please"" ""the check please"". What if i'm learning that language as something i simply wanna do for fun? What if i'm not planning on going as a tourist and eating at restaurants?"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app to learn almost any language you wish to, that too in an easy and entertaining way. There is no place for boredom while you are learning through this duolingo app. And that streak feature made it more engaging."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Enjoyable to learn both listening, writing & speaking. Initially joined, the individual plan was &12.99/ month. I left the plan because I was having surgery. Didnt know when I could re-commit to daily lessons. Imagine my shock when I saw that NOW after 2 week trial, they expect a full $89.95 for the remaining 54 weeks. Sad. I'd have easily been able to keep my learning commitment a month at a time but a full year? Life is unpredictable & sometimes a learning a language is not lifes priority!"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It's constantly freezing when I try to start it. I'm using the 14-day trial right now and I cannot for the life of me figure out how to subscribe monthly because I don't have $85 to drop at one time. obviously I'm going to have to cancel even though I'm enjoying it because of these glitches unless someone can give me some advice
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"it's an okay platform to learn some languages. They need to work on their accuracy with translations. Not always correct. A minor detail, most of the time I try and get XP for the ranking, it doesn't register,"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's good to pass time not more, it has a lot of errors and mistakes. Also the system doesn't recognize your progress properly and doesn't give you all the points you win. Many crashes and freezes as well"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,the free veraion can be a little frustrating with the ads. But that a choice I made Finally getting ahead with the Spanish while building vocab. I have not utilised the offer to learn or compete with other users...which could be incentive to learn faster
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The lessons progress smoothly. There is lots of help and tips in case you get stuck. Animations and different voices to listen to ensure that the learning isn't boring. Great app!!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is helping me to keep on top of regular practice and is a lot of fun to use! The family plan is a really good idea also if you have people close to you learning a language also - it doesn't have to be the same one. I'm really enjoying Japanese and my teen is using it to get extra revision in French.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is an amazing app. I have had this app for a while (definitely willingly) and it's great. There's so many languages to learn. I have a 237 day streak (just for fun and not because the duo lingo owl said that if I skip a day, he'll take my family.) It's pretty easy and fun and there's definitely not a green owl standing a few feet in front of me threatening the lives of my family members. 10/10"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"2 years ago when I started this program, it was objectively better. The move to AI is painfully apparent and the intuitiveness is long gone. At this point I'm far too invested to back out, but as soon S I'm able to switch to another method of learning I will do so."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The method is Splendid, but there are some errors now and then with the translation given between Greek and English. IE.."" I saw a lot of things being there "" according to the Greek sentence should be simply ""I saw a lot there"". Also, there have been errors in personal and possessive pronouns, hence statements about ""his"" husband. These are things that cause confusion and can obscure the learning process. Thank You üíï"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a very good app in learning how to speak another language. It is very interactive and it was devise for you to learn easily through clever and integrated lesson.

I know there's a YouTube channel of it but, does it have to show those photos? It's pretty threatening and forcing.

But devs should add the option to disable league participation.Since I want to learn and practice language for myself & not to compete with anyone so seeing I upgraded or degraded league is kind of discouraging.It makes me to gather xp faster rather than learn the language properly.So a option to disable it is required."

Sometimes in Tagalog there are 2 or more ways to say a sentence, it just depends on the person on what order they say it or what words they use because sometimes there are more than 1 word for most words in English, I hope you'll fix this for some non-english speakers who would want to use english next time :) overall the app is awesome!"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good for vocabulary, however not great for detailed understanding of the grammar/ conjugations etc...Also previously you had to form sentences ( in the given language) and was more challenging, however this feature seems to have been disabled? I would recommend bringing this back .."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I took the subscription to learn english from telugu. The biggest drawback is there is no personalization. Even though you are an intermediate english speaker you still get those same primary school sentences. I always get same sentences again and again even after practicing 100 times. It is harsh to say but they won't teach you anything.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Its a good app. It works well, and I'm learning to speak German, but there are some aspects of the language that I wish they would explain better, such as how in German there are three different forms of the, or how live is leben if I'm talking about where I live, but leben if I'm speaking about someone else. It doesn't really explain stuff like that."

I found Hindi, Irish, Catalan.. But no Basque :(. I think the game interface and the streaks are set up really well, but it would be great to see the Basque language or even Native Canadian languages on here. I think if there's an app to make it more accessible for people to learn languages, it would be a huge step to include the languages that are struggling to keep alive"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app. I'm currently learning Japanese. Duolingo has such great tools for learning the language and characters. Out of all the apps I've tried this is way better and helps me really grasp Japanese. It's better than Bussu. I would even say it's better than most language learning apps.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I am so amazed Duolingo is the best freaking app if you want to learn a language better or even from scratch.It offers you exercises for speaking writing and even listening I didn't know Italian at all and now it is like I already knew it.I totally recommend it to everyone who wants to learn a new language it doesn't have all languages though.#bestlanguageapp#
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app. Their social media running people are amazing and have an amazing sense of humor, too. The app allows you to learn multiple languages at once and is free. You CAN pay for no ads, unlimited lives, etc. but you do not have to. There's also a leader board that helps motivate you!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"garbage. it's basically a scam to get you to pay more money. in term of pedagogy, it barely scratch the surface of basic language learning. there's no real language study of grammar or structure here, not to mention the countless errors which as much as you point out are never corrected nor do you receive any feedback on your comments. don't waste your time or money"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Excellent! Perfect app. Maybe even best app ever. They do great work teaching languages with a brand new method that makes you addicted to learning. I love duolingo üòòüòò I also have this problem: why aren't photos saved to my phone??????????
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,currently on a 2+ years streak and there are a couple of things that annoy me about this app. 1. if you click too fast it can mess the lesson up 2.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,When you try the 2 weeks free subscribe to super duolingo it is written clearly that the app will remind you tu unsubscribe 2 days before ending the free trial : it doesn't. And it coast around 100‚Ç¨ with no refund possible. I know it is half my fault but I find this very unscrupulous.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Language learning is not easy. Duolingo does nothing but lie that it is, and leave you less willing to learn than before. It tries to keep the illusion alive by giving tiny and easy lessons, but they don't teach you anything. If you ever spend any amount of time on the app, you will look back and see that it was wasted. If you want to actually learn a language, go to Anki. They don't treat you like a toddler who can't put in effort there."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is amazing, I picked the 50 day lesson and after those fifty days I knew how to speak Japanese fluently this is amazing especially if you have a child at the age of around 8 years of age all the other language learning apps are not worth it but Duolingo makes learning fun and competitive with friends and family, I heavily recommend Duolingo to learn new languages if it's for fun, travelling, or just to improve your studies therefore Duolingo is a five out of five option if you're white."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app was good, but now its going downhill like most apps. It keeps telling me I am offline when I am not and when I do find a way to start a lesson, it works for some time and goes back to saying I'm offline. I even uninstalled and reinstalled it and still the same issue, even going as far as to write an email about the issue. I have a 125 days streak and it is hell to keep it up and I am almost about to drop out of the Diamond league because I can't practice at the right time. Please fix it"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Paid for it, but it's not worth it except maybe for the main languages. I'm doing Swedish and it's very basic compared to say Spanish. Furthermore the league mechanics are annoying. I don't think you can really learn a language this way, it's just a game now."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm only working on one language right now, but this app is incredibly fun, easy, and presents great challenges to really learn a new language of your choice. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn, whether it's for fun, or for business, or whatever reason."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I know some people argue about what the ""best"" way to learn a new language is but honestly unless you're under a real time crunch, just jump in wherever you can and get something done. It's been super nice to hunker down and do something productive in my free time and it'll hopefully eventually open up a whole new world of conversation with people I wouldn't be able to communicate with otherwise. Good app üëç"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"this is a great, fun, easy way to learn. I felt like i wasn't learning, but ur practicing the words in different ways, and it helps you to retain the words and hearing them different ways like from a child, women, man and even older women, helps"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I basically ditto the last review. I would have given it five stars but at the moment you've got me completely stuck it won't recognize me clicking on the lesson. If you fix it I'll give you five. Thank you. Spanish lesson 8 unit 1. ugh!... Just figured out the answer bars were hidden below and I got past it. Thank God! I'll move my stars up but not 5 yet darn it... Stuck on the very next one a different way!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Over the past year the app has been downgraded and all of the features that made it helpful have been taken out. Every lesson you get errors and issues. If you pay for it the issues are worse. So I use the free version now. Every time I use the app now I am reminded how bad it is.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is both awesome and fun. Easy to navigate, and also, if not paid for adverts are bearable. They only come up at the end of a quiz, not in the middle. Most of them are helpful though..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The payed version (no ads) is great for 4-10 yo kids to get a good starting point for learning English as a second language, it really keeps them entertained and going.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Was a great place to learn a language!! But after a few lessons the app showed a that my answer are wrong firstly I ignored it but now when I was learning Japanese all 5 answers I chose where correct but the app showed it wrong 'NOW MY 75 DAY STREAK IS GONA BREAK'!!!!!!!!! I kindly request the team members to fix my problem üò≠üò≠ Thank for your time
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app will try to automatically renew and charge your subscription even if you click for it not to do it. Done it twice with me. Make sure the account you use doesn't have money on, will save you a lot of trouble. I regret recommending it to my friends. Too aggressive with their greedy fingers in peoples valets. Absolutely disgusting business practice. Also yesterday duo started to use my name a lot in exercises and today I got locked out of some of my soc.media accounts. It's like a virus."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I don't mean to sound like a bot saying. ""omg duolingo is the best app for learning languages"" but I'm learning so much from this. and its fun too.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,At first it's a great game I personally I used Russian and it was telling me letters it was showing me how to say things but then after a while it just wasn't that good and I found myself not wanting to go on it can you get an ad about how you should get the free trial and that you should buy the premium or whatever it was after like every lesson.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app so much, it helped my Spanish a lot and encouraged me to love Spanish and explore other languages I have wanted to learn. Overall I have been doing Duolingo everyday and it's a good reminder to sometimes just learn for awhile when I'm on my phone. Recommend for everyone!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I like this app because with only a 61 day streak I can already speak a sufficient amount of Spanish! Yay! There should be options to change time zones because randomly around 1 pm it will tell me to get my early bird chest in 3 hours. At first the timing for this stuff and the streak update were in sync but not anymore! And I think in the settings there should be options for blind people to learn I myself am not blind but other people are.Also there should be more available for non super users.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,i love this app!!!! you can focus on different goals or just one and learn so much. i have an android that lets me have a widget for duo and it helps me keep my streak goal and even on some less motivating days it just takes 15 mins tops to keep my streak. i recomend using the voice and talk lessons to better learn but you can skip them if youre in public. once again i have to say i love this app. i am a duo friend forever
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've used Duolingo a while, and while it has helped me learn Spanish a bit, the direction it's taking isn't very good. I have to click through so many things, and the voices sound so robotic. not to mention the new ""avatar"" update- so now i'm either stuck with my old profile picture or an ugly avatar."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The updates are great, it's just annoying to have to go back a whole section sometimes to redo lessons that have been added to. Like I said, the updates are always great and I like that there'a lot added to learn, but it's like I have to start all over again sometimes."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I dont like it.. tried Korean and they throw you directly into Hangul and dirctly showing you a silent o a eo.. ""Ïò§""... Like thats an o""h""? if I read this correctly.. I learned ""„Öó"" from an different Language learning app.. and I dont think learning the characters at first is the best choice either but well everyone has their own opinion about this.. still the annoying part is that you get directly thrown to Hangul without learning some words/sentences.."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have been going for 18 days straight and I have learned so much. It is more than worth it to pay for it too, even though the free version teaches a lot it can slow you down with your progress. Any way you do it, Duo will get you speaking a new language! Es muy bueno!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So good, been using it to learn Japanese for just 24 days and in proud of the progress I've made with the language, though I don't have any stories, please bring stories back to the japanese course Edit: Stories are now in the japanese course and I am now on a 264 day streak lol. I've come soooo far. Changing to 5-star because I'm satisfied with the app so far. Edit: On a 452 day streak now and my Japanese is better than ever. I've learnt so much from duolingo and I'd give it 6 stars if I could."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it's actually really fun, a little tip don't do to many languages at once unless you want to be like me 2 years ago and do many languages at once and get overwhelmed and delete the app for two years, (plus it's really fun to tease your friends when they do something stupid üòÇ)>:3"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Learning a new language has never been easier! I feel very confident moving through the lessons, and appreciate the various study methods the app uses to make sure you have full comprehension/retention."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Well, Duolingo is a really lit app,it's educational and fun at the same time. I highly recommend it to all those wishing to improve their knowledge in a particular language‚ù§Ô∏è.But I think there should be other provisions to earn hearts(For those who didn't subscribe) aside from having to buy them with 350 diamonds which is really hard to earnü§å"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"it jumps right into the lesson's pop quizzes without teaching. I'm trying to learn Korean but I have no idea what I'm learning, I just match the sound to the word and vice versa. not entirely sure if I'm learning a vowel, constenent or phrase."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,A really good app to learn japanese from. I am still exploring it's features as a student. Hope that more features would be added as an aid and not as a blocker or just as a mode of monetization.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Update: The translations are really weird, it's clear they've fired their employees in favor of AI. You'd have better luck learning from Google Translate. The new update and format are really lacking. The app takes forever to load, not as much reward for progress anymore."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"they want to keep you at a certain level unless you pay, because i have been stuck at 5 and never advancing on the free version despite being vehemently accosted by the unceasing ads that also have grown more passive aggressive by way of inscessant persistence inspite of my genuine desire to learn and accell. Do they want us to learn or do they not... especially for those of us who are on fixed incomes living pay check to paycheck. yes i am grateful & have learned much, but seems only to a point"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I got offered free super trial but it held me back. I should be able to reject the offer. Also, the higher leagues are too intense. Far too much competition for sill amounts of XP. Don't bother. Just go at your own pace and practice and review the things you need to."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There marketing strategy is super aggressive. I first tried Duolingo on iOS, was gonna go premium but they took a years fee instead of the expected month. I'm on android now, and despite watching every ad, they are giving me ALOT of unknown words per lesson to try and make me fail and sign up to premium. Its not working and is transparent. Don't trust the cute drawings, these people are cut throat."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,technically excellent. although I'm learning Japanese and would love to see more grammar explanations and some polite/common differences as well as the ability to choose which unit I would like to review.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Overall looking good for learning. However learn the letters section is really pathetic. Many a cases the correct letters are not available in English and closest once are marked as error. Also sentence making needs careful attention. For example they teach as, ""An apple is eating the dog"" or ""A soap eats cat."" Needs more care in assigning lessons."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"ƒ∞t used to be very good, now it doesn't explain grammar and comprehension rules in details, so mistakes happen quite often. When I started using Duolingo it used to give grammar and comprehension details with every lesson so I knew how to translate properly. ƒ∞t's still useful but not as much as it used to be. ƒ∞f you can bring those details back, I'll highly appreciate. Thanks"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Teaches pretty well. I love how I have a shortcut on my home screen so I'm not forgetting about Duolingo. Ads only appear when you finish a lesson, and lessons are long, so ads aren't annoying. I love the little animations."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"i used it when I was in Japanese classes when I was in high school, and it was very helpful. all do, when it gets much harder and you miss in one, it drops you a lot of points and that's not good üò≠ that's why 4 stars hihi"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Nice app for learning languages. And now you know what international level are you on. I like the friends quest and the rewards are also worth it. Well, the leaderboard doesn't update quickly."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Often crashes. A lot of unnecessary actions with the interface. The application is overloaded with game elements, at first it's fun, but then you realize that it takes a lot of time away from real progress."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"when getting 2x XP, it auto use it, even when I only get into the app to claim a reward. some times I just don't have time to do some duolingo. Made sure I had no 2x XP power ups, and still got one and forced used it instead of storing it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm continuing to learn Japanese with Duo. I honestly think the app is really well made and works quite well. the best part of Duolingo has to be the fact that it makes learning a new language more entertaining than any other app I've tried; this helps to keep me more interested, and has me coming back daily to learn more. It's definitely worth trying out."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"If I could find the option to turn off email notifications it would have been five stars, but my inbox is getting spammed. Great learning setup, and a wide selection of languages too."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"two things i don't like is how they spoon feed you some answers and they break down answers unnecessaryily. an example would be douzoyouroshku which is nice to meet you. instead of having ""nice to meet you"" as one answer you have to pick out ""nice"" then look around for ""to"" then ""meet"" etc. If the answer isn't nice to meet you it will never have all 4 of those words there anyway. Having ""Nice to meet you"" as one possible answer along with other full answers would at least make it multiple choice"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've tried staying away but... I keep coming back. this really is the best ACTUALLY FREE app for learning a language, I think. yeah, they have the ads and ""Super"" stuff now, but it's all good compared to every other app. thanks duo, let my family go soon please"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"good service, but too expensive for one person in my opinion. the family-bundle for 6 accesses is a great idea, because it reduces the cost to under 2‚Ç¨ per month per person and it is explicitly allowed for anybody so they dont have to be a member of your Family."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's straight to the point and love that its built in a way that kind of makes it fun to learn without feeling like you learning something difficult as a first time learner. I'm taking up chines as it's said to be the hardest to learn. I'm in south Africa in a country that does not really speak Chinese.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,the only reason why I'm rating it four is because it's much better to have something more traditional alongside Duolingo. this is amazing for application but doesn't breakdown grammatical basics and sentence structure the way that traditional learning offers as a basis.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I am improving my German, but during the translations there is too much focus on English grammar. I am really good at English and I know my grammar is not wrong, but for Duolingo it is black and white. And seriously, the German word for break is Ferien? You got to be kidding."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,You can learn any of the languages in a easy and interesting way by duolingo. It helps a lot. It makes you practice until you understand it 100%. Since I am learning Japanese from it I am getting better and better then yesterday. Love duolingo ü©∑ü©∂
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The app has a exercise where you have to select the right pronunciation of the word or the alphabet. There have been times where the pronunciation shown are the literally the same. And then you are left to guess the right one.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a good App for learning but it often has useless sentences that I don't even need to learn, also are some sentences not right with the translation and for better understanding, you need a dialogue that it doesn't even has and only speaks for the sentences you learn."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great way to learn another language! The only thing I find odd is how the app determines what my five weakest words are. It never seems to recognize the words I struggle with and seems to choose words at random. This wastes time by having me practice words I'm already confident with.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App was kind of cool until.... was told I would be notified 2 days before the 14 day trial was over and before the charge. Instead was bombarded with passive aggressive notifications and emails for losing my ""streak"" making me feel like a turd for not using the app for a few days - and then charged $83 without any notification as stated and no way to refund. Basically, I got scholded by a green owl and then he robbed me. Dont download. Get Babble."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,it's a really good app for helping people to understand or learn more language's and plus it's really fun! i love it and sometimes I get a little to scared when I'm about to miss my streak because um.. I just don't wanna make duolingo mad that's all.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"BUG: there's a glitch after you complete a ""Rapid Review"" stage and the time runs out. The app locks, Android controls (3 buttons) suddenly appears, you have to stop and restart the app. 100 Gems are gone but no reward, no stars, still level 1/3. @Duolingo Please re-credit my 200 gems (I did it twice) and fix the bug."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, this app is super fun!! The teaching methods range in style so people with all kinds of different learning strengths and weaknesses will have the opportunity to do well."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"this app is really good for learning new language. But a problem is , it's need a lot of time to learn language. They teach the same thing over and over again, so you have to practice it more than once. Yes practice is good, but they do it too many times. So I feel very annoyed sometimes."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it's amazing, I'm learning Japanese and I thought it would be so hard to learn but the way it teaches us just makes it so easy! so I give this a 5 star:) and if anyone is searching for an app that teaches us languages, I recommend you this (make sure Duo doesn't takes your family away-)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I was learning Chinese and it was useful learning numbers, money and greetings. It was definitely worth duoplus. It has now been updated and reset progress and now it's teaching beverages and nationalities? Waste of a very useful app. Would be 5 stars had the course not changed. Goodbye duoplus"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I think they could structure the lessons to be more challenging and also provide more context and explanation for conjugation and tense. some languages are better structured than others in my opinion.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is good, but now it never opens on my phone. Requires a phone restart to open if it has been dormant for a few hours. very annoying. Tried all the recommended fixes with no results."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New year, exact same problem: Quest system = FAIL! Finished 21 quests, rewarded for 18. Have screenshots of app failure, but know staff won't care to follow up. From last year's experience, this won't change. Spent too long on this app to give up, and Duo developers know this. Similar low ratings from others stuck in their own Duo-Hell should be a warning to those thinking of trying Duo: DON'T DOWNLOAD! App is buggy a/f, developers = zero f!s given + no true app support."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why have you stopped explaining why someone has got a question wrong. In fact in a few lessons now all the options are 100% correct so it's wasting lives. This is so frustrating. Explain why I go wrong so I can learn. You are starting to force me to pay for lives or super duolingo. Therefore it's no longer ""free and fun"" as you claim. Don't give a vision if you are forcing people to pay money which goes against that vision."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great tool to learn a new language, nice user interface & layout. They help keep you motivated. They can reward you with free Super Duolingo for a limited time if you're doing well."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This game is fun because I'm learning Japanese, thanks to Kanji. BUT. I have found a weird bug for typing like for ex: ÊúÄÂàù saisho When i was typing ‰∏≠„ÄÖ's translation it said i was wrong and showed ""naka„ÄÖ"", this will be impossible for those who don't have a Japanese keyboard. Please fix this, thx!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I like duolingo to try to learn a language (french) . I understand this app has ads. But one of the ads I just got was porn-y and adult. It was an add for AI. If I was playing duolingo at home I would care less , but I'm using this app in public"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It is the greatest learning app I've ever downloaded. There are many game like levels. You earn diamond every time you earn a batch. All I want to say is that this is the perfect way to get a chance to be a great language learner. And at last but not the least this is the best app to learn any particular or multiple language.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This game is very good to learn other languages, but i mainly find it a bit hard to start languages from scratch. Could be just me though. Although the app is amazing, it doesnt have maltese as a language which bothers me a bit."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's fruitless since it doesn't teach any language structure. Many listening lessons are hardly different in sound and there is never a proper explanation of what they're supposed to mean. Also extremely expensive and predatory.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is just not a good way to learn in my opinion. I have been a paying subscriber for a couple months now and the pacing seems counter intuitive. I am learning Japanese and I barely have the fundamentals of Hiragana while its muddying the waters with Katakana and Kanji. Its also outdated as I have learned that many of the words I have learned are actually no longer used or written in Hiragana and are instead now Katakana words. Dont waste your money.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,After falling in love with this app I would of given 5 stars. Now I'm continually unable to open app after 30 days of daily practice. The error message says app has a bug. I tried deleting the app & re-downloading. Now I'm giving 2 stars.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Started learning French when my family went to Abidjan as missionaries. We have improved well enough to understand them and speak a little French. Decided to learn Spanish because my son studies it in school. I've learnt so much and grateful to Duolingo. Lived in the US for several years and didn't know nothing in Spanish. Good job Duolingo.Its a powerful app for languages
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's great tbh, i love learning with duo and have been for almost a year. I would just like to see explanations for some sentences, like when learning new time forms just explaining why it is that way or maybe short tips on how to remember what to do and how to conjuct it"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's a really great app for a beginner but if you want to learn your favourite language properly you need to do hard work by yourself too you can't just rely on Duolingo but Duolingo is a very good app üíØ recommended (sometimes I am unable to understand some pronunciation as they sound computerized otherwise it's a great app)
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"as far as I have it I say that yes, learning new languages the school way is more than ever boring,but this app makes it a lot of fun, because just like video games, you have quests to complete, treasures to open and the best part is that during all this it feeds you the veggies without showing them,that ways u learn in fun, and the leader board ofc, that is what keeps me committed. Good job Duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App doesn't explain why a word you used was wrong. It just tells you you're wrong and keeps asking you the same question until it's right. Super frustrating for things like usage of ""vivr"" vs ""vivo"". I end up getting help from other resources online because Duolingo is useless for this"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I'm glad that I am taking French lessons on Duolingo. I have seen so much improvement and the ability to really be focused and consistent through their constant prompting. I'm glad for this platform.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Over 1100 days of Duolingo & I'm now better at French than I was when I was at school 40 years ago. Oh my god I'm old. Meh. Anyway, I can read quite a lot of content in French newspapers now. The one area I still need to work on is conversational French. It's still hard to hear, process and translate at speed."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The viewing of awards in the achievements section is broken. Cannot longer see how far away the next award level is or progress made. Very bad user experience and design choices. This feature existed previously
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Cute app,doesn't really help me learn Spanish but ima keep trying until I learn it,even if I have to do it over and over again(Ive learn to remember so but not a lot,and dome of the words are hard to pronounce,I am a 10y old so I don't expect it to be that easy for me,but really cute game I play it almost everyday and my mom is glad to know I'm getting to learn Spanish and I'm proud myself,Great game to play,so if you wanna learn Spanish,this is the perfect app to download,Hope everybody enjoys‚ù§"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very good for learning basic conversational French. The lessons are fun to do and the number of repetitions seems about right. The voices are sometimes hard to understand.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app helps you learn languages easily and runs very smoothly but there's still things they should add and I wish it wouldn't force you to do it everyday but not much wrong there because it keeps you consistent, overall for me 4/5"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Kudos to Duolingo's social media and marketing team! Overall, a great app for any level of language learner. I wanted to brush up on a couple of languages I learned in high school and college, and now want to learn as many as I can!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Thing is, of late your app keeps telling me that I'm offline but I'm fully online, keeps taking me back to previous exercises that I have completed, it's so annoying and it wastes my time and energy. Please rectify it. Thank you."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm learning Italian for an upcoming holiday and am delighted by how well it's coming along. Each lesson is short, so I can fit several in each day - while waiting for the kettle to boil, during the adverts when watching TV or in my lunch break. There is a good range of languages so I might take up another one for fun, after my holiday!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"An excellent way to approach learning language. This app manages to get around the fear of getting it wrong, feeling intimidated and all of the other barriers to trying that you can think of. Plus, it's fairly entertaining"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Such a great learning tool! But recently it developed a glitch where it keep resetting my progress to several lessons back, over and over again. Very frustrating!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duo is a fun app to learn a new language on, it's a lot more fun than babble. If you would like to learn a new language but don't want it to get boring fast then get Duolingo, you can strive to be in the top 3 for every month. Try to keep your streak and see how far you can go"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Learning so much. great motivations and a very cute and accessible app. I recommend it to anyone. It's definitely not a waste of time. I am able to speak and understand basic Spanish after two years. Thank you, Duo!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love the updates Duolingo has given, but I can't enjoy the app itself when whatever I say into the microphone doesn't get picked up, and it's hard to type anything into the app when my keyboard keeps closing."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I actually haven't learned anything except how much I subconsciously remember from highschool 25 yrs agoüòÇbut I'm really enjoying feeling smart&like the different methods used for repetition.**The whole Ana/Anna name thing should not affect our scores-the Spanish&German programs pronounce it identically&either spelling can be used in either country.Also confused by the list of ""friends"" pulled from contacts,I don't know ANY of them, they aren't my people!Who are they?! Otherwise,so far so good!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I suggest please show currently selected language name always on top, it becomes difficult to recognize currently learning which language. It would be great for multiple language learners. Everytime I have to focus on that."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Fix the app buggin out when trying to input vocal answer. If you tap at the prompt at the wrong moment, the lesson will bug out and become unresponsive. Only way to fix it is to quit the lesson."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it is very fun to learn in Duolingo, they motivate you and notify you every day. I love the animation, and the stories. they have lots of languages. learning a new language with Dou was much more interesting than learning it in school."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a very good app to learn a language. I only knew alphabets of Korean and Japanese and the rest I learnt from Duolingo. It's really useful and a fun way to learn any language. A minor problem: I can't see my followers (I have updated the app and still it's the same) Also, I wish the Korean and Norwegian course will have ‚ÄòTips‚Äô because it's just better to know atleast a little info about the lesson learning beforehand."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pretty good, it's helping me learn German. It is kind of annoying that you can only make five mistakes and that the sentences for the first little bit are kind of random. Once you get past that, however, it's great"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It helps a lot with any language you want to learn. The only bad thing about is it sometimes doesn't pick up your voice when you talk but that barely ever happens. Really good app though.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"As someone starting a language 'from scratch' I like the approach and reviews. You can learn for free (!) if you're OK with ads, or can get a pretty reasonable cost or even better a family cost to get everybody learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Subscription cancelled. No idea why this has better ratings than babel. The gameification is fun, but there are so many issues. Theres no grammer or explanation of new words and their different forms, so presumably you're supposed to guess at their use or search it online. It's clearly ai or procedurally generated. Questions such as, I like... a, Japan b, France c, England Doing a french course, I guessed at france since all were fine answers. The answer was apparently Japan. Why?..who knows."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Would be much better if the English was UK rather than American English as there's too much confusion with the so-called English translation options! Surely Duolingo should be able to offer both versions so learners can choose the version of Englush Langyage that's their native one?
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't feel like this app wants me to learn another language more than it wants me to pay for its use, an example would be learning ""new"" words; often times I'm being ""taught"" the same ""new"" words without any structure beyond ""correct"" or ""incorrect"""
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Glitch in the app, lost my streak and all motivation as the notifications stopped and the widget didn't show me the usual colours that prompted me to do it. Attempted to contact them numerous times with no luck."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app was fine until they decided AI was the way to go. The Ukrainian course which previously had native speaker audio now has TTS which makes it harder for me to understand actual spoken Ukrainian. In addition, I no longer have access to the forums which I loved for their in depth explanations and resource recommendations. The app is also filled with adds and makes me want to not learn anymore."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's gone downhill from when I first used this app. I recently re-download it to try and learn some Irish, but the listening lessons are impossible as they don't pronounce the words well and speak way too fast."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's been broadly OK to use since I started back in 2018, but the exercises have steadily been made much worse by forcing you to use word clouds most of the time rather than actually thinking through the meanings of words and how to phrase them in your own way."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app audio doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones the talk back test fails most of the times when I try to do it via Bluetooth headset. Have seen many ppl facing same issue over reddit groups as well. Please help to fix this bug.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love it that lessons start with basics and earn xps. Levels increase as you complete the exercises & are repetitive. In this way it helps you to recognize and understand English & Spanish and before u know it you are speaking & reading it well.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"When using this to learn Spanish, it becomes apparent that is teaching Americans to speak Mexican spanish. Therefore not too good for English speakers learning Castilian Spanish which uses a lot of different words (in both languages). Also the voices used are really anoying and unrealistic."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,it's the best app to use to learn and it shows you the meaning of the words and the synonyms they have. this is very helpful for people who like to have high vocabulary and an understanding of different ways to express their sentences like me. it worksüòÅ
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is not for all the English learners. I want to learn an English language and my mother tongue is Tamil (one of the Indian language). When I tried to get started after the app was downloaded, it asks for which language to learn, and gives the list of launguage speakers for. For Indians It supports only the speakers of three Indian languages Bengali, Hindi and Telugu. There is no Tamil. You do not have option to learn by choosing you as an English speaker. Disappointed üòîüòî‚òπÔ∏è"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is an app I think is amazing!! It makes learning your dream language much more fun! This app encourages you with streaks and ranks and events to earn badges! I know this app may get hard sometimes but it doesn't mean it's bad.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,amazing app! it's so helpful when. you need or want to learn a new language. or just catching up on your skills for a language you have learned just need some touch ups. overall super great app and really fun!!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have used Duolingo to learn French for a couple of years now. I just use the free version. The adds are not too bad and worth it for the service you get. The way the lessons are structured really set words and phrases into your memory and slowly build on that. I just do it casually but I find myself understanding a lot of French conversations that I hear kind of naturally. I can understand written French even better. I would love to see a duolingo ai chat both practice tool for us shy people
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Latest update screwed up my lesson plan. There was recently an update to the Chinese lessons and now as review I have a bunch of words I've never learned before. This app is great but a lack of consistency between lesson changes would be worrying
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Can't open Duolingo anymore, is it banned here? Not family friendly anymore? Okay thanks for everything all this time btw. I appreciate a lot. Really amusing. I still give 5 stars. But actually I have so many things in mind for Duolingo: - I hope it's available in Bahasa Indonesia and not just B. Indo-English course but other languages courses too - I hope it offers Thai Language in Bahasa Indonesia Duolingo and/or English Duolingo That's it for now. Thanks in advance if my feedback accepted."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It does teach you the language but a little out of order with some odd sentences, but it's repetition so eventually you learn all the words and how to construct more normal sentences and questions."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,All good and super helpful for learning but some units are perfectly spaced and setup and then others feature 10 new words in one small unit with not enough spacing to grasp and full understand the word. (Eg: German Unit 4)
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,üëç Very Good Spanish course. üëéWe should be able to skip from one circle too another. Too repetitive. The fast match game is a very good idea. The Japanese course sometimes displays romaji even though I only have kana selected
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is such a good app.It doesn't feel like I'm playing a game ,it'd just so fun, and it thought me more in a week than my school thought me in months! It makes me come back evryday so i can earn more xp ,however it doesn't have my home language malyalum,it would be really nice if they could get more small languages.But I would definitely recommend this app to friends and family who want to learn mainstream language üòÄüòä"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"An absolute useless waste of time unless you are only intending to use as a game. The app does not teach you or explain anything about the language you want to learn, but depends on you learning from the mistakes you make. Your better off reading a book to learn than using this app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,fun and actually good way to begin as long as you are consistent. I would also recommend actually taking notes down in a notebook as you go through these for better retention outside of using the app.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am a paid subscriber I don't know how to get in touch with you, but, there is an error. I had completed the same lesson 8 times and not able to move further, kindly correct the problem as I will cancel my subscription as is it of no use to pay further."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A fun way to learn a bit of a language. I only do it for fun so it's just enough for me, but I think if I had to learn properly (e.g. for work) I'd need a traditional course and have Duo as a bit extra practice."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app has really kept me on track learning a new language. You go at your own pace without the pressure of impressing a teacher. Very repetitive lessons, so your new words stay in your memory."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have returned after a few years of not using this app. it's become absolutely horrid gamifies mess. no options to find the exact things you want to study/refresh. no user comments, a lot of garbage easy material that you're forced to waste your time on. terrible, stay away"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is easily the best language learning program ever. It makes it extremely easy to learn new languages, and encourages you to keep going and get a streak. There is so much to it and it makes it feel they really want you to learn. They even have Klingon and Elvish, Math, They literally added languages that don't exist! If you want to learn a new language please get this and this only."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app and it actually really helps ppl to learn a new language, for example I'm learning Spanish for fun and now I actually know how to speak it a bit, my aunt moved to a whole new country (czech republic) and she used to know 0 words but now Duolingo is helping her ALOT so if you want to learn a new language, you should install Duolingo (I'm learning Spanish btw)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is the best and the perfect app for learning many languages at one time. It helps to learn many words. And the big thing is, it tells us clearly and understandingly . it is the best of all.üòÉüòÉüòÉü•∞"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great for beginners and for general conversing/identifying the world around you with a new linguistic lens. I love the animations and course design, perks/incentives too. Give it a try. (:"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It is a very good application to learn any language. it's teaching techniques are very good any one can learn any language easily but I m facing some problem while doing lessons like it get exit from lesson and even from the app when I answered the question and press continue it dose not go to another question instead this it get close.. except this every thing is good üëç
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a fun app, and being in Mexico, I am finding occasion to use it immediately. the app is fun and progressively more challenging. Dedication will help you learn the lingo. I use Duolingo in combination with Babbel, although I don't find Babbrl as much fun as duolingo's game style of learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's pretty fun to help with beginners. Having said that, though the translations are correct, there are other ways of saying some of these words. I wouldn't say I'm good at my own language, but I know enough that some of these translations don't have to be so long, and they can be shortened down. I give this atleast a 4.8 because most of these words I'd understand why they are important to remember."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,it's actually pretty successful at teaching and keeping you from forgetting what you learn. way better than school Spanish in terms of learning effectiveness. very surprised coming from someone who's hard to teach.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,word choices particularly early on are often strange. The translations into English are not always correct. That said it's easy to use but could do with some improvements.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"it keeps giving me the word collector badge and then taking it away, and it won't let me practice Italian to for hearts but it always works with the two other languages I'm learning. It is really annoying that there is some bug that doesn‚Äôt let me progress in the app"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,What is the point of doing all the classes if when you update you don't add any additional levels so that people that have advanced can get up to date and not be blindsided with all the new words and the new grammar/concepts that we just keep on missing
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I do like the app, but the competitive league design has you focus on words you already know to keep you in league rather than placing a higher emphasis on learning from new chapters. The xp gained in league Vs the indvidial units from the home screen also reflects this with more xp gained from competition and repeating what is known rather than spending more time learning more unfamiliar words, phrases etc. Would be better if this was flipped."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,this app is amazing it helps greatly with language skills and it can teach multiple languages at a time. best of all it keeps you on track of your score and you can see what your friends are learning too . they can even follow you back üòäüòäüòäü§ü enjoy the app guys you'll love it
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There seems to be a recurring issue with the count of xp. It's an overall good app, but with the gamification bit of it, it's important that the xp counting is accurate"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Standard of lessons has dropped continuously over the past few months. Every ""update"" has made them more repetitive, less idiomatic and frankly a chore. After such a long time of enjoying the process and not missing a single day, I'm no longer motivated to go in and do the same nonsense over and over."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"the app is rapidly going downhill. I've been using it for years and I no longer use it other than as a streak reminder to study. after I do a single lesson to keep my streak, I go study using other apps. please do not use it to learn Japanese at least."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love Duolingo and would recommend everyone to learn from it. I had taken Duolingo while learning French at school and there was no test that I didn't Ace. Duolingo has made learning any language easier and I believe that I could finally achieve my dream of being a Polygot someday. Apprendre le fran√ßais, c'est facile maintenant. Merci beaucoup Duolingo!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Mostly working well, sometimes issue with selecting words from wordbank. When I try to select any word from word bank it colors read and cannot be selected. I lost all hearths since I had to fail exercise to try again."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it's the best app for learning languages, you can learn any language in like three months and start talking it, and every thing is so easy don't worry, it's not difficult to learn a language, you don't have to do too much work, just 15 minutes a day is enough to learn a language, and you will learn the language without feeling, without any suffering."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"good! I have only being playing for a while, and have oy got back background knowledge, but this has helped me from my current learning level, and a bit more, I really enjoyed but would like less adverts."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's a great app for learning but it doesn't have tamil. But why do I rate it a 3 stars? Well the way the people talk in Duolingo sometimes confuses me. So please change the voices of some characters.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I just love Duolingo so much! I have a super Duolingo family plan, and it is so worth it. I am currently taking Italian, French, Romanian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Japanese. Duolingo teaches so well! I think that it would be really cool if Duolingo offered sign language lessons too. ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I really didn't like the update of this . The stories are also not available too. You should give hearts infinity but the heart is only given five and If i loose them all then i would not be able to learn the new lesson that's super bad. This app was used to be fun in learning new languages but I don't think it's now that fun to learn any language from this app. I am so disappointed that maybe in future I have to delete this app. And also there is too much ad which really disturb me in learning.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"THIS APP IS GOOD BUT HEAR ME OUT. ADD A STORYLINE IN WHERE DUOLINGO AND THE PLAYER IS LOST AND THEY NEED TO LEARN THE LANGUAGE, There's gonna be some adventure and puzzle and in order to solve it they need to translate what's the word that the puzzle give until they complete the challenge, after that they'll finally get back home, in this way it's more fun to learn other languages, hope this comment GETS A FEEDBACK"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've learned so much language from here! At first, I thought this application would only discuss formal vocabulary and simple conversations, but it turns out there is literacy too! an example is that we are told to extract information/implied messages/meaning from the reading we read"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to be great, now it's so bloated with stupid rewards, gems and makes you take a refresher when you skip a few days. Too much waste and not enough time to just practice. I bet 35% of the time in the app is just claiming rewards or skipping bloat"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I LIKE IT ALOT. It helps the language learning so easy and understanding. But I really hate that every 2 to 3 lessons after a super duolingo ad pops up which is very annoying. So please take care of that.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I was doing my japanese lesson. It was going pretty well but then came an exercise with listening. I had to put a word that wasn't even there! Thanks Duolingo for wasteing all my hearts and 10 minutes of my life! But axcept that it's a prertty good app but please fix that.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I find that it does quite a good job but there is one language I would really like to learn more then the others they have on there Wich is Croatian. If I was able to fine lessons on Croatian it would be a complete 10/10 but I'm putting it at a 9.5/10 because of that. And the Appstore won't let me do a half.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Well worth paying for this app, an interactive and engaging way of learning languages. I especially like the daily challenges, leaderboard and being able to add friends to support them with their progress!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"overall this is a very good app but one learns slowly through this app and actual problem I face is that it does not focuses on grammer that's the main issue otherwise this is a great app for learning, practicing and memorizing new words."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I like that you can spend a few minutes or hours at your own pace. I decided to pay for the super package so that I wouldn't get sucked into buying things the ads were offering. (I spend less this way.) I've learned more than I thought I would.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"even though I'm using the free version, I enjoy the style of learning and options given. I only wish it allowed more than only 5 mistakes. it makes continuing streaks difficult unless you pay"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'v learned a lot. As you achieve progress, you are promoted through the leagues. It feels like encouragement. But you can do all your time for the day, all your lessons & be demoted. That's discouragement. I placed #1 one morning & was demotioned by afternoon. I'm here to learn Spanish, not game For this reason, I'm demoting Duo. I'd give them 5 stars, great app! but am demoting to 4. Today I'm demoting to 3. Demotions are dicouraging."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Exp count keeps freezing during double exp time, so unfair. It makes you demotivated to continue learning when your record doesn't improve real-time. Kinda sad to experience especially during my trial period, I was super sold in buying premium. I don't think I'll push through and will be canceling because of this. Update: Exp still frozen lol"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've used Duolingo on and off for several years at this point to study Russian. While not a replacement for learning language through a class, it is a great way to regularly practice language when you don't have the time to do a full-on class."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I HATE THE CRUMMY AI used by this app! They used to have real people that would answer questions when it was hard to understand how to speak correctly. Now the AI makes me crazy because I never know where to put ""frequency adverbs."" There's nothing in the app that is at all helpful! Where should words like ""spesso"" or ""di solito"" go??? AARGH!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I do love Duolingo, BUT think it lets me off with a lot in terms of pronunciation (too much!), I can't access the theory behind things to understand when it gets more tricky and the competitor in me hates that you never know what time the leaderboard will end at the end of the week!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Thumbs up to the developers, it is great language learning app. The podcast listening anchored by Ngofen & team is good but appears to be focused on Past perfait tenses. Can we have stories that will cover other tenses"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Started off good but lately it has become a headache, I am starting to dislike this app. Their hints are starting to be all out of order making it hard to learn, the lessons jump around so frequently you can't memorize words easy. The need for hearts is getting really annoying, the app is messing me upso I'm starting to be left with no hearts when it's the apps fault. The ads are really annoying now especially the one for the premium, the premium isn't worth $12.99 for what it offers."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy the format very much, but the sentences are, very often, nonsense and not helpful for real-life situations. I will continue to use the app, but I also use other apps to supplement this one."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Can be good and can be inconsistent, with very easy exercises and then exercises that are beyond this level of learning, whichisveryfrustrating. Unusable without a paid subscription."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love the free super duolingo from chests, no intrusive ads and a fairly good learning experience, it really encourages you to learn through keeping your streak and taking your family if you lose it. Great app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a great way to learn and practice a language. Our family chose to pay for a family plan so we didn't have to see the ads that we felt were not appropriate for our children. We also don't love the lgbtq agenda pushed in the practice, but this app definitely helps practice language skills."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very goo, the only problem is that you cannot make mistakes ore you have to wait and if you want to don't have ads and learn faster you have to pay. But is very cool and it's funny use it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I would normally give a good review because it is a good app for learning languages, however, I got a 14 day free trail for the ad free version and I was told I would be notified 3 days before it would charge me. I was not given a notification until after I was charged, and there is a no refund policy."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Perfect mobile app to use the time wisely. very useful for learning a language. I rarely find some bugs while choosing Japanese words but that doesnt make big difference, which trust the app builders will fix."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Because no grammatical information is given, and you have to figure it out, or guess, doing just 20 minutes is exhausting. After I finish this Duolingo course I'm going to have to do a real course to learn all of the things that I was forced to just guess here. To give you a context, I speak several languages already, have studied in University how to teach second languages, and have spent about 7 years of my life teaching second languages."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Gameifying learning languages is tough but Duolingo does it well. haven't used other apps but even without a comparison, I feel it's good and potent without keeping you back if you're not paying for premium services."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Excellent learning experience takes you through all the steps in learning how to speak and write a new language.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Duolingo. It's easy to use and they teach terms and subject matter that you would use in everyday conversations. They teach you words and sentences necessary for travelling, eating, and meeting new people."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I wish there was a wider range of languages (waiting on Thai) and a wider range of exercises within the less common languages. But other than that, it's an excellent tool to help in learning new languages. I've thoroughly enjoyed practicing the Arabic alphabet."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app really helped me. I wanted to learn Spanish and when I stood on my streak I was saying basic sentences in about a week.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is a remarkable, multi facetted app in terms of language learning! The reason I gave 3 stars instead of 5 is BECAUSE OF THEIR TECH SUPPORT. I couldn't link my family members to my family plan trial, but I was NOT ABLE TO REACH DUOLINGO'S CUSTOMER SERVICE AT ALL! THEY DON'T HAVE A CUSTOMER SERVICE PHONE NUMBER! I SUBMITTED 'BUG REPORTS and EMAILED REPEATEDLY FOR TWO WEEKS, BUT NEVER GOT A RESPONSE FROM CUSTOMER SERVICE to this day! That's why we chose not to join the SUPER Plan after all."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible! The app has become unusable now. It keeps rolling back to a previous state undoing all the lessons I've done. I've lost count of the number of times I've attained legendary status on the same lesson only to find myself back at square one. As it's not letting me progress any farther, I guess I'll have to continue my polyglot journey on some other platform. Should've known when they started removing useful stuff like discussion forums while introducing useless UI changes & nag screens."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the app, just one thing i dont like. In korean lessons, the audio questions between ""kyu"" and ""tyu"" the sound is identical, and just ends in a 50/50 guess, really frustrating when you choose the wrong one"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a very nice, efficient and effective platform to learn a language. kudos to the developers. but can you add a feature where we can connect and have individual conversations with other learners?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Even with the 'super' mode I cannot do speaking lessons. It physically will not let me. I feel this is hindering my learning, and overall, makes it a little less enjoyable."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The Navajo Language is a fake-out. it is a disappointment and racist that they set up unit 1 to seem like the other languages with full capacity and audio... so I subscribed for the year...Unit 2 onwards has no audio for a tonal spoken language. All bug reports got no response. No way to be refunded. As this Language is primarily being learned by Indigenous Americans trying to save their Language&Culture due to Genocide&Suppression of Language&Culture... Duolingo needs a self-reckoning.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The duo owl does a good job of judging me when I miss a day of practice. I love having the friend challenges to help get me into the practice. The targeted practices (if you pay for the super duo) is very helpful in drilling those phrases into your brain. Every time I hear ""demo"" in anime now, my brain automatically fills it in with ""demo, niku ga suki desu""."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Simply the best app to learn any languages completely for free. I use it to sharpen my English, Spanish and Russian while helping my friends learn some of the languages as well. I can't recommend this application enough for anyone interested in learning a second or even third language as well, and it's best to pair it with some other study material like a YouTube video or possibly even an online course."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They got rid of comment sections, the one way you could actually learn any nuances of material. They also laid off 10% of staff to make way for AI generated content. I paid for a year of duo before they made these changes and feel I'm no longer getting the same product. Would much prefer human written content that actually explains the material, you know, like I'm actually being taught a language instead of playing a memorization game on my phone"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Generally, I love this app. However, I get frustrated with the match madness as it can be slow in replacing options which slows you down affecting your score."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is a great app to learn a new language. I'm learning French and can already understand sentences! It would be nice if they added sign language to the selection of courses though.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am disappointed that i was only offered the annual individual rate when I signed up. Without a trial period, I didn't know if I would want a full year. Now that I do, the option isn't available. May cancel because of this."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Obviously a good helpful app but the advertising & hearts system ruined it. Limits how much I can learn unless I pay which ends up disturbing my progress... The opposite of what it should do! Hope I can find another app :/
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is really interesting and easier learning for me! I loved the way I'm allowed to repeat the correct pronunciation and place the meaning in the underlined areas plus, SO MUCH FUN! Thank you! üëç‚ô•Ô∏èüëè"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have complained here previously about the fact that Duolingo repeatedly changed the order of lessons. But not only do they change the order of lessons, the practice chapters no longer practise what's in the unit. In several units they're obsessing with people hearing scary noises and voices and not being able to sleep. This has never been part of a lesson!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's helpful but it did not specify that it wanted me to use feminine terms for the sentence translating ""You have an American neighbor"". For Latin languages like Italian where this happened to me, I'd like to see an addition that would say masculine or feminine somewhere as a tone guide. Needless to say that to effectively know what it wants typed there should be a tone marker for sentences that are solely words that have feminine and masculine tones like ""You have an American neighbor""."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"duolingo is a very polished app with very little to nitpick. Perhaps some of the menus are difficult to find, but the app does what you want it to, and it is an enjoyable experience"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"while the ads can be a bit exhausting, learning another language is actually quite fun in this format. I will, however, suggest that Duo starts teaching Indigenous languages such as Cree and Blackfoot. I know, I am not the only person interested in these languages."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The only real issue I'm having is when I have to do the speaking exercises, I click the button and it doesn't pick up audio. I have my microphone allowed for the app, but it still doesn't work."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"great content at least on the Chinese course, however suddenly the update messed up all the units and now there's a lot of new words/phrases I've never learned before even though it automatically took me half way to the second section..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love duolingo. It makes learning languages fun. I also live how you can compete with other people. Not only is that feature motivating, but it also gives me something to look forward to. It's like a game, except you're learning something new."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Amazing app also it makes it very easy to learn and if you don't know the word you can just see the translation but one problem is that it shows multiple words and it's very hard to know the correct one please change it
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,overall really good app to learn or brush up on a language. The conversational prompts are decent and fairly realistic to what you'll encounter/need to use while traveling.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is probably my favorite app, but I suggest you allow users to choose what to practice or at least don't make the learning process so random. And maybe add mnemonic charts to facilitate learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Some of the lessons have wrong selection of missing words. Other times, even if you select the correct answers from previous lesson it is still mark wrong. There is no option to learn Thai language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Like the app. Only microphone hasn't been working for 2 days and sometimes you need to re-enter to see your actual progress - it doesn't update during the session
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Do not recommend this app. It charges you for a year subscription which means it's great at the beginning but quickly speed though courses to hit a words learned per week quota. Hard to slow it down and actually learn the languages
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is a wonderful app to learn a new language. Even the ads aren't that long or annoying, being that it's just duolingo ads and not a bunch of random things."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I use it to learn Spanish üá™üá∏, I love it but it would be better if ads weren't there. Also when I run out of hearts, it won't let me play unless I click 'do more for heart's' which is pretty annoying. Overall it's okay but could be betterüíï"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I‚Äôve been using Duolingo to learn Dutch and it‚Äôs been a fantastic experience. The lessons are quick, engaging, and really effective for my daily practice. Highly recommend it for anyone looking to learn a new language!"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Ver. 5.142.4. Going through Japanese from English course. If you just follow lessons then there is no problem. The lessons are bite sized and entertaining. But the rapid review is getting more cursed with each update. Even regular reviews getting corrupted with each update. I'm speaking about ""Tap what you hear"" part. There is just no audio. This problem spread even to ""learn hiragana and katakana"" section. I fear to imagine what's going on with kanji section. Fix it please."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's been so much fun learning Spanish this way. I'd like to experience in high school, but none of it really stuck. But for some learning again and it's fun. I'm actually remembering so thanks to Mr. Owen. I have a hand up. Because I still learned the word. To John Jacob jinglehammer Schmidt. In Spanish, it's Juan Paco. Pedro de Lamar."

Then in the middle of a test, part of the test disappears so not only can I not submit my answer, but I have to quit and lose all my xp points and have to start over. It WILL NOT let me advance at all now and I'm going down in rank. Ive started the level over and tried three times and it does the same thing. They better refill my hearts and give me my rank back, for real. I have screenshots to prove."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I think this game is excellent for if you are trying to learn a different language but I use Duolingo for french because my dads dad is french so the next time I see him I can say some stuff in french to him. thare is at least 100 languages on Duolingo so if you want to speak in a different language you should use Duolingo. I've only had Duolingo for four day and i already know lots of french
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Good but when you run out of stars it's not fun as you come off for a while and it says you've ruined your streak or something like that and I'm not paying extra for hearts and I'm trying to stay consistent but the hearts keep running out so please if you can change it to like 20 stars because it's very annoying
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"There are some bugs in the app. Sometimes you can't hear the sentences you're supposed to translate or see images you're supposed to translate. other than that, it's pretty good for being free."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I really enjoy using this app for learning languages and the best part is it's free. I wish the biblical languages were on here in their ancient forms as well but otherwise this app is amazing. The memes are also great.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,No words can describe how good this app is. i never thought that i could learn something especially a language using a mobile phone. But duolingo helped me learn Dutch like nothing else. It is soo good. Highly recommended.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really love this game because it's teached me Korean and other countries too. And if you made a mistake, it would let you retry it. and you have bages. I am on first, but you need to be on it every week. Athen you would be in one place. but if you're yeah, you would be something like 30, not good. I recommend this game if you are lering a country in school or moving to a different country or for future job like me. I want to be a kpop idol. So recommend it"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Don't give it a free try. I tried to cancel before the end of the free period several times. However, there was a technical error and there was no way I could cancel it. I don't know where to contact to resolve this issue. This app informed me that information about it could be done through Google Pay. But I couldn't find a way to do it in Google Pay."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is really amazing Even though I found learning a foreign language very hard, with Duolingo it was like a piece of cake. The explanations are easy to follow and it's also a fun experience üòä‚ù§Ô∏è"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is on the whole a great app. I am deeply concerned with the recent change to monetize gems, and consequently to then charge money for higher XP rounds (Note: in premium, where I already pay a subscription). An app that is designed for kids has now become yet another in-app purchase monster. You should immediately fire the money-grubbing execs who though this was a good idea."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I just started learning Japanese using Duolingo. Before I started, I already know a lil bit of its grammar and most of it characters and how to write then. I just noticed that the pronunciation of some characters are incorrect and the some english grammars are weird. This app must also accept other answers cuz I end up with a wrong answer even if my answer is the same from the correct answer but just in a different arrangement of words. Some pronunciation just really bothers as they're incorrec"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"100% designed to drag out forever, even if you spent an hour a day, progress is very slow, you are better off using this to supplement some vocab. This should not actually a primary learning method. Every time there's an update I get set back months of progress. Would be better if their focus was on teaching you a second language more quickly instead of drip feeding you a little ""dopamine hit""."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's the best learning a language app I seen so far, but it's not THE best one. It could get improvements. This app has a speaker so where u can speak into it and say words from the language you picked, it's a good way to practice but it's hard because it's just makes what you said completely wrong if you don't say it that exact accent, especially names. Yea NAMES YOU NEVER EVEN HEARD BEFORE-LIKE EXUSE ME IF I CANT ROLL MY R'S I STILL SAID IT."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo has been an incredibly useful tool in my language learning journey. The variety of languages offered and the gamified learning approach make it enjoyable to practice regularly. The lessons are well-structured and gradually build on each other, helping me to grasp new concepts effectively. The community aspect adds a fun competitive edge, and the option to practice speaking and listening skills is a great addition."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is great, and a lot of fun. But I think it should spend more time getting me to write in the target language rather than translating from it. Also I think the user should get a second attempt to correct near-miss mistakes before losing a heart."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I use it every day. I love it. My only slight criticism is when you flit between learning different languages because you're visiting a country and want to know the basics I would argue Duo doesn't cover the basics first.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I think it's a good app it just jumps into things rather quickly. I would suggest having a writing app and a pronunciation app that will help you learn things faster. for me, I've been learning korean for maybe a week with duolingo and two other apps. I haven't been on em lately due to not having enough time, but I already know a few sentences in korean literally by heart. it's easy for me to understand because I've been taking notes. I like it. Just take it slow and try not to do it all at once"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I feel like when you're still pretty good at it in the beginning you don't get harder questions but it's good learning. And if you try to get the free trial for super learner and just that so and then after that you don't have to pay and you just go back to normal it won't let you. But still it is a very good way to teach languages.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It used to be good, but they've gotten rid of the ability to interact with other users and ask questions, ""paused"" their Welsh course, and replaced their translators with AI. The last one was really the last straw for me; I definitely do not trust an AI to teach me a language, and I don't morally want to support a company that is willing to compromise so much to increase their bottom line."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it's really good but if we could run out of a heart once every 2 wrong questions that would gain my confidence a bit more? im a big fan of duolingo, even though I started yesterday. I've been learning French in school for 3 years and I've learned more on Duolingo than school."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app. Read through the tips with each lesson before doing the lesson. If you can, write the tips down in a book. That will help you understand the language much better. You can also read through the short stories for a more passive approach to learning. It's fun to compete against others but don't go chasing points at the expense of learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a great app, it helps you to learn new languages so easily and I'd especially recommend this app to students who need help with exams aswell as teaching them the expected level of the level you are at, it excellent you to be the best in your class. While using duolingo I got 50 out of 51 on my French test which included questions which I hadn't learnt in class but I had seen or learnt in Duolingo. That helped me a lot so please use this app as it's good for your language development"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A good education apps for kids or language learners to learn and have fun. It had many good features such as leagues and different minigame. However I noticed there's a bug or unfinished porject, I was unable to reach [Flawless Finisher II ], even I had done 20 or 30 lessons. It's a bug or do I need to done 100 lessons?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have skeptical about learning a new language from an app, when it cost so much more to learn from experienced teachers going through structured course. But I was wrong. Duolingo uses Gamification and Spaced repetition to make learning languages effective and fun. Well worth the subscription."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"the best app for learning new languages, except some characters (hanzi only) of the Chinese course are different than the real one. Idk if it also happens to other languages but for Chinese it happens. Please fix it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The only reason why I'm not written a five star is because of the new interface. I don't know if my review will be considered I think it would be much more beneficial if are mistakes by corrected mid lesson right there are some mistakes that are made that are basically neglected and they are very key ones when it comes to the languages so so I think it might be a tad bit better if more comprehensive tips were given at the start with relation to pronunciation intensive languages like Korean
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"extremely difficult to evolve, way too many phrases you'll never have to use irl, way too many weeks with no new words, no explinations for the mistakes, they help you make mistakes by arranging words that look alike next to each other, moronic and annoying untargeted ads, tons of notifications, always asking for money even though the paid version is just as lame as the unpaid, no difference between them, so no way to evolve in a faster pace or at least to learn new words, not so usefull app"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like this owl. The app makes it easy to learn and refresh on a language with bite-sized lessons.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This all is really good! I have had so much fun learning Norwegian from this app. The only problem I have had is just the adds but they are never to bad. For me though I like the leader board part because it's a little competitive to get Xp so I like that! Great app has helped me a lot with learning a new language and very fun!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it seems to be working. im learning things without really knowing im learning things. i didnt think i was, but i am! it gets easier and harder at the same time. if i keep messing up it keeps making things easier until i get it right then starts making them harder again but i still get them right! im still a bit confused on how and why this works but i know if i keep plugging away at it i will finally get it!

I have spent a lot longer than 20 minutes a day and cannot progress to higher levels as others in my weekly group have 4 times more XP (not sure if these are real people). I do not subscribe, its annoying duo ads asking me to pay (don't mind the other ads, although they are very repetitive). Older man is incoherent. Helpful to see others comments instead of social media links."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I tried Romanian-English pair and can conclude that I've simply wasted money on subscription. 1. I don't care how you translate ""a shark eats a seal"", I want to order a steak! ""The owl is yellow!"" 2. The app wants you to precisely select proper verb and noun forms without even trying to explain the usage of these forms. Oh, and every mistake sets you back... unless you purchase subscription. So not predatory. 3. The quality of native language parts is suboptimal to say the least."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love it - super easy way to learn a language without an effort. I like the way the lessons are structured and the repetition, so the new words learned stay in your mind. For a free app, the ads aren't too much to deal with at all. I look forward to learning multiple languages with this app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I learned both my native language (English) and my second language (German) by practice and use, not with a book or lessons. I had been slowly learning Spanish until I started with Duolingo. The repetition and easy of using a language, not just studying, has greatly accelerated learning. I am happy to practice to earn ""hearts"" to keep going as this provides repetition which makes me even more proficient. I like the ability to start and stop. As an educator for over 20 years, I love this."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Works okay to get to A2. Nice to keep up with friends. Predatory charging and monetization and microtransactions. And also they fired their staff in favor of AI. This has led to a significant drop in quality with a weird malfunction almost every day now. However the prices did not drop after firing staff. I unsubbed because of this mess. Perhaps I'll resub if there is news of them hiring staff again or if they fix their grammar situation.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have been enjoying the app. We got the family plan, so everyone can use it as much as they wish, otherwise you can run out of stars. It has daily goals, reminders, a competitive leader board; many different ways to encourage you to keep up a daily habit of working on it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Really poor attention to regular and PREMIUM users for months. For instance, Duolingo has been mixing pasive and active voices in English exercises. Or making free translations when a direct one is possible (even better). The thing is: nobody is fixing it. They used to send a message accepting suggestions, so the community reporting mistakes had a feedback. Not anymore. Finally, Duolingo magnify regional differences between American and European English and Spanish."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have decided to learn Vietnamese as a supplemental skill for my job. Asian languages are extremely difficult to learn, especially for native english speakers. Thanks to Duolingo, I have learned enough so far to communicate on a basic level with several of our customers. The idea is that we will have better business opportunities if I can connect with certain customers in their own language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Why does Doulingo reset the progress on the ramp up challenge when a lesson gives you 2x XP? That's really shady and intentionally hinders one's ability to score competitively. If I have gained an advantage legitimately there is no reason to interfere. It's bad enough players are using hacks to boost their score to keep you from getting ahead. Please do better.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Each new ""update"" makes the experience worse. They got rid of the notes and words, now they've redone the paths and units so that my lessons are either repeated or done away with and I'm done trying to keep up with the fact that it insists I've learned things I definitely haven't. I'll be using a new app from now on"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"GENERALLY PRETTY GOOD APP, BUT MAY NOT BE DEPENDABLE ON IT'S OWN: It's important [this may at least somewhat vary depending on what language(s) you're learning] to not just depend on duolingo to learn a language, because the way it teaches is at least somewhat random and may not teach all the grammar & nuances, but it is a pretty good app overall and updating relatively often and can help w/basics & vocabulary"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The fact that there is a free version is great. The ads are annoying but I can't afford a year up front, or the monthly fee if you don't pay up front. Makes learning easy though."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm really enjoying the app as I have been learning Latin. However with my first language being English, it is certainly difficult to grasp new concepts in other languages that don't occur in English. I would just really love it if there was some sort of explanation for these nuances. For example, the nominative and accusative clauses are not grammatical concepts in English. I didn't even know they existed until I looked it up elsewhere after getting frustrated of getting the answers wrong."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Every time you feel like you're getting somewhere they release an update that completely reshuffles all your lessons and changes definitions. So things you never learned it thinks you did and things you have it thinks you didn't, its a mess. All while bringing more and more bugs that didn't previously exist with each update. It used to be amazing a year ago but I guess corporate greed took over since."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I'm not sure if I haven't made it far enough but music is a huge part of my life and it'd be really cool if as a community you guys added songs you listen to that we can practice our listening skills as learners with. or like a lesson using a song would make it easier for my adhd brain too. a rhythmic style of learning that makes me want to sing along in a language I don't feel confident in yet sounds really awesome. also I had to use chat GPT to explain the tenses of bebo bebe and bebes
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The AI works well, although on character runs, several words very newly given (new to me) run together. When a small word is not heard, hearts are taken Also, it may or not take away hearts for misspellings, but is unforgiving when a complicated word has 2 clearly transposed letters. It would help to give another chance with the word highlighted, as it does when I may have a gravelly voice and it can't make out my speech,rather than kill the whole phrase & take ‚ù§Ô∏è Fingers make mistakes as well"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app doesn't work for most people. You can learn words, and if you get far enough, you can learn how to make sentences, but it can't teach you anything because you can only relate words to things and not even learn them properly.

When they do some maintaning it just goes off and my double is away like it's my fault the app is not working. I learn Italian from German and i must say, the German translation suggested is often wrong, so you need to guess what they wanted to say you don't loose a heart. And next time you pick the same wrong versioj but no, it's another wrong version."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Haven't been able to use the app for days. It keeps saying I'm offline even when I can comfortably stream a whole movie on YouTube. Had to update the app. That didn't help. Uninstalled and redownloaded it. Now I can't even sign back in. Keeps saying I'm offline. I've rebooted my phone and still didn't work. Every other app works great. Now I'm about to lose my 544 day streak.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"been using it for about a week now. I've downloaded it before but ever since I was grounded I've only been able to use productive apps and I've been wanting to learn Spanish. so I downloaded this. lessons are fun and effective, and it feels satisfying to get a streak going. all in all an Amazing way to learn any language"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Overall a good language learning tool however it can be very repeatitive as it then to repeat the same questions that has been answered correctly numerous times before. With AI it wld be better to focus on questions that has been answered incorrectly on numerous occasions to reinforce the error correction. My candid review and feedback.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Used to be a 4 star review but honestly it's gotten so much worse. The changes made about a year or so ago to the Japanese course have made it practically useless as an actual learning tool. They've removed comments (that were always full of helpful advice!), tons of kanji from the actual lessons, and more."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Thank you for allowing us to learn in such a easy way. In Japanese there is a constant update of the lesson plans, and I can see the thought and effort poured into these updates. Thank you to the whole team. One comment I have received from a Japanese friend is that the prononciation is accented towards Osaka. This is fine to learn but most of the country TV, radio and internet broadcast may be accented towards Tokyo. Something to think about. Any chance of paying a one time life time fee?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Mostly pretty good, but repetitive. The vase is pink, the rice is pink, the water is pink. Why never any other colour? Up to the 4th round & still the same words. It hasn't taught hello, how are you, please, or thank you, but it's taught 'architect' & other words that are barely used? There's a bunch of incorrect translations I've found so far as well so that doesn't help. Sucks that Malay isn't available but it probably wouldn't be accurate anyway üòï"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Progression is great. Speaking back at the app has its limitations possibly because the app has to work with the general technical limitations of the device etc. I can babble something very random and get the app to say I spoke correctly. Other than that this app is very good.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"the best app for learning a new language!! and, free! what i would suggest: for the ""select what hear"" exercise, there is no translation when you only have single words. it would be nice to have those translated also (so, when selecting them, you hear the pronunciation, but it would be good to read a translation also). thanks and keep up the good work!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have seen the new addition: words under the 'your collections' tab, which is very good. Thank you. If possible, perhaps include the articles for the nouns and even further, include the complete sentences that were learnt. But for now, this will do. Once again, thank you very much."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good for basic vocabulary. Could be better for grammar. Unfortunately the lessons are more academic than practical. In other words, not helpful if one is preparing to travel to a French speaking country"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'd rate Duolingo 4.5 out of 5 stars. It's an effective and fun way to learn a new language with its interactive lessons, gamified approach, and diverse language options. However, some users may find it lacks in-depth explanations or advanced language skills. Overall, it's a great tool for beginners and casual learners."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is good but, We cannot depend on this app it's just for practice.Somethings we have do on our own. We can not learn any language on this app. If we , don't do some practice, vocabulary,grammar on our own . Btw , It's a good app for practice.üëçüèª"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It's hard to see the text inside the thing / puzzle piece. White text with white background. I was suppose to continue using the app buti hate those white things.. change the colors of the texts and the background please.. or add settings for us to modify it.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I am one step away from uninstalling. The number of words you need to translate in a sentence should never change. You are actively tripping people with ADHD up by constantly moving the target. You also never account for simple typos where two letters change places getting marked wrong for things like that is counterproductive. I clearly understand and my only error was having fat fingers. People with ADHD experience rejection sensitive dysphoria and it will turn us off the app.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I enjoy this game like way to learn a language. My only criticism is that it does not tell you why some enunciations of the same word are used vs others in certain sentences or situations and you have to figure it out or be left to keep answering wrong. I would really like an explanation option.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I can't understand why there is no (European) Portuguese from Portugal, it differs so much from Brazilian or any other Portuguese speaking country. It's ironic that a Spaniard cannot learn it's neighbour language version. Plus it is misleading that you can learn a language with this app, you cannot, you can only learn some words and sentences, mostly old fashioned that no one uses anymore."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it's a very good language app, I've already learned a couple of phrases in swedish after only having it a couple of days. Obviously, swedish is harder than like Spanish, you could learn way more with easier languages in 2 days. I like how the app takes it slow and teaches you words before sentences."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Duolingo since 2013. I bought the paid version last year but unsubscribed recently because I could no longer afford it. I am absolutely appalled by the state of the free version of the app now!!! An insane amount of long unskippable game ads inundate you every single level you finish. It now feels far more like one of those trashy games that you see ads for on Facebook rather than the professional app it once was. Also they removed the comments section, was sucha helpful resource"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The apps gone a long way and it's actually getting better. Been doing Portuguese for over a year and a half and enjoying it a lot. I love Swedish but wish the voice could get an update or at least have a male voice too. It's a little less enjoying learning the languages that only have a single voice.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love it but the constant nagging about maintaining your streak has the opposite effect...instead of motivating me, I sometimes avoid doing the lessons because I don't want to get nagged about it that day. Also, there's no way to indicate 'I don't get it' and get more information or explanations, you learned words but sentence structure and phrases are often not explained"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"During high school, I took 3 levels of Spanish class but never took them seriously. Now I decided I want to actually commit and finally learn. This is the best place to learn, and they really do a good job making it fun to learn a new language while making quick progress towards your goal. Deserves nothing less than five stars!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Giving users the liberty to decide when to use XP Boosts earned from lessons and Daily Quests helps maximise learning time (some of us don't always have the time to learn at a stretch). I also think that leaderboards should be assigned based on the user's plans. Super and Normal users shouldn't be in the same league as Super users have the potential to earn higher XP in lesser time than Normies. Also, why does the app keep lagging recently? I can't extend my streak on time because of this."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a wonderful app for practicing languages. It builds piece by piece, with enough repetition to make it stick. The daily challenges keep you motivated, and there are enough awards to keep you coming back."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I really like the app. It's free and you have a giant variety of languages to choose from and the activities are fun because you can choose how long you want to do a lesson for. And you can do as many lessons as you want to. If you are trying to learn a language for a trip or just for fun I recommend Duolingo.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it is a good app, at least I think so. Particularly for word associations. I have used it for Spanish mostly and a short dabble in Japanese. I can not speak the language of Spanish. However, I can piece together general conversations better."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Speech sections work on a random basis. Sometimes it plays alright sometimes not. Have to click at random answers just to get moving on. As such it impossible to finish timed exercises, nor to hear pronunciation."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I used to feel like this app was really helpful for practicing and learning languages. Over time it has become less helpful and now it's often incorrect. I feel like it's become detrimental to any actual learning.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Make it so you can freeze/pause the xp potion I understand you want people to keep playing, but a lot of the potion goes unused, sometimes I'm doing like 3 lessons, and I get an xp potion, and I just don't wanna keep learning at the moment, so it goes to waste"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It was a really nice app and was enjoying learning a desired language using this. Everything turned upside down when suddenly one day it started showing forced ads between lessons and eventually that forced me to quit.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I am full setisfy with your work and learning experience. But ‚Ä¢there is no option to turn off vibration. I hate vibration, this is consume battery in extra amount. I request you to please give the option to close it. ‚Ä¢And if you have made the app so socially active, then you should also give the option to put your personal photo in the profile picture."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"There are no relationships aside from a husband and wife that are not different sex. It is not culturally or necessary to bring these issues into a language app and I am disappointed that this is how the progress is furthered. Love who you love bit, leave the language out of it. Ein, eine. Meine, meine. I don't want to use this app just for the fact that it's suddenly not relevant to people that don't need pronouns. The woke is not physiolical, biological or factual. Words, far from Change."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The best place to learn any language in the most fun way, very interesting lessons with pictorial presentations, use it before you travel to any new country or improve your skills on any foreign language at your own convenient time and place."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,it's a very great app. they always encourage me to keep my streak going and meet my goal. This app also lets you practice your pronunciation with the language of your choice. I can't wait to surprise my aunt by speaking her native language!! all thanks to Duolingo üíØüíØ
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Generally a good way of keeping on top of a language. More of an ancillary tool than a core means of learning a language, but does well. It's a shame they removed the 'comment' feature, as it really helped sometimes to understand idioms or why certain phrases or words are used."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Can't wait to see the music and math lessons in Duolingo. The team quite smart on choosing the next goal to expand the business. I always wanted to learn music but I didn't have a chance to learn it well. From learning the language with Duolingo, I am now a bit more advanced on my Japanese reading. Now that I'm confident enough to watch Miyazaki's movies with Japanese subtitle and able to understand it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I understand that they have to make money, but the heart system killed it, goodbye for now, until it's fixed. Also, the lightning rounds are basically gem draining since it's impossible to finish, even for someone fluent in that language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I am sorry I love this app but it just doesn't help it only helps in taking A LOT of my storage because of the ads which I hate and then I forget everything. Also when I am learning the answer isn't there and yes I can say this because when u press a word in a sentence it tells you and for me the answer isn't there so basically making me stress more with school and this.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Stop changing content when I'm 1/2 way through all of it and taking away legendary completeness without notifying me. Add stuff, don't revert progress and remove good features. I am not renewing my premium subscription. I am so sick of this nonsense. First they took away forums -- the absolute BEST way to get clarity on wrong answers or things you don't understand because they couldn't handle criticism. Now they rolled back all of my progress 25-35 sections for the 3rd time in 1.5 yrs. Bye Duo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love this app and I'm trusting that I'm learning well because I'm dreaming Spanish words now lol. Improvements: It would be great to practise all the words you learn and to have the translation of the sentences, even when you get them right. I've been using the app pretty much every day and it's a great new addiction! I'm addicted to the rewards and seeing my friends' progress making it almost a battle to be great! it's so infectious my housemate wants in on the fun too üòÇ"

Just one problem still a decent app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"In terms of grammar, the app teaches too many katakana words; for example, if you want to teach food names, is cheesecake and cupcake really that high on the priority list for people going to Japan? You think, of all foods, that's what people visit Japan wants? It's also not good at keeping track of what was already taught. In the lesson I just took, I learned 5 vocab words; 2 of them katakana and 1 of them has been in my lessons for at least several months."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Designed to be monetised rather than being a useful tool to learn language, numerous useful features moved behind paywalls and the glitchiness of the app doesn't help learning when you lose the ability to study with each 5 mistakes. Now paying for it they still lock one of the practices (match madness) behind a paywall/ridiculous skill ceiling so it stays at 2 stars. As an app, it's decent. Terrible monetization. The lack of online mode is an insult, too."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,this is probably one of the best apps to learn new languages. like it has many languages you can choose any one you would want. whoever made Duolingo they are one smart person and if they see my public review I don't really care you know why? because they have worked really hard for this app It probably took them like a year to do this!! owe some respect to whoever made this app. I really appreciate having this app in my life now guys when you install this app give the owner some respect nowüëã
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've already completed the Ukrainian course but would like to keep the knowledge fresh. Therefore, PLEASE, update the final unit (daily refresh) so that all 6 lessons include words from the whole course! Currently, 5 out of 6 lessons are throwing around the same maybe 30 words and phrases (those ""weak words"" are not weak at all after months and months of drilling them :) ). Meanwhile the final lesson has words and phrases from other units. Would love to refresh the whole course in those tasks."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"repetition and variety are interesting and keep the learner interacting. however, more useful phrases like hello, goodbye, numbers, and directions would be more useful for an actual trip to your chosen country. phrases like I am an apple are not useful."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,You can actually learn any language from Duolingo if you are committed. It's also a fun üòä way of learning a language. But something's can be a little annoying üòî that you can mistake only 5 times and after that it takes so much time to get back all 5 hearts. But to be honest being a free app it's fair ‚ò∫Ô∏è enough.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"OK so, the app is alright bUt- it can be annoying at times, and it doesn't explain everything. I've only ever spoken English and I'm doing spanish, and it gives words that I was never taught and just throws it in there, like yeah, you can click on it and it'll tell you what it means. But it doesn't explain how to use it in a sentence and how the placement works. Like un and una, how was I supposed to know that even FOOD has masculine and feminine things LIKE HELLO?? HOW IS A HAMBURGER fEminiNe."

On the downside: - Too many examples are about Duo (annoying) - The ""practice your 5 weakest words"" exercises are mostly about words I never make errors with - It would be useful if in the exercises where you have to make a sentence from words below, you could enter words between ons you already entered instead of having to remove the last part of the sentence"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,very great app for learning how to speak any language. I'm very pleased to say I have basic knowledge after 1 week of duolingo.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,First of all I was offered free trial and signing up charged me immediately full amount. It is nice to learn new words but very basic ones and they repeat all the time. For begginer it is fine but not for more advanced. No explanation of grammar or syntax. Nice challenges and competing with others with points
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Hi Duolingo Team, I noticed that for like the past week the app has been very slow especially when loading a new lesson. Please, kindly look into this. It shouldn't take 10 minutes to load a lesson practice."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I'm learning a lot and it seems effective as it helps your practice daily and keeps you from forgetting. The one thing I find frustrating is the daily quests and monthly badge. There are bugs and the lesson you just did doesn't always count.

I just got 3 ads one after the other.. i mean i accapt the fact that i have to see them after every lvl but having to watch one after i just watched one just so i can watch another one... and didnt even get a life for it.. worst part always the SAME AD... like how do u make money from ads by playing ur own ad constantly? By playing it so much that i cant do anything else until i buy sub or what?? A bit too pushy.."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,turns into more of a game than actually learning the language. there is definitely learning happening...but when you make a mistake there is no teaching that happens. I recommend using another app that actually teaches the language while also using this app (for fun and getting more reps). also I'm having a heck of a time using the speaking function for the app as well. can't figure it out. Add some teaching points and make the speaking tool flawless...I will give it a 5.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Really fun to use! I'm currently learning Spanish and I am of Filipino Descent, so I have an advantage with some words as I understand them. Duolingo has a way of making things a good habit to pick up on should you really, REALLY want to learn. it's a good app especially if you want to start learning seriously, this is a good base that you can use as a jump spring to getting into another language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The latest update is seemed to have less microphone capability. Some spoken words were not accepted as correct but the other time I didn't even say any words and it was accepted as correct.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They don't reply to emails. Edit: Don't remember why I put that, so I'mma leave it there. The app's good to learn languages. Update: Please Fix this app. It's very unresponsive Wow what a sudden turn of events y'all have made! Got too much greedy all of sudden! Boo to you all. 4 hours for hearts to refill? So in a way you are discouraging people to use this platform and find alternative! Good work pushing off your user base! Edit: Duolingo is not fun for me! Everyone's racing. Stressful."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Prices for the premium are really high and it teaches japanese slang but doesnt tell you its slang. Once they specify or fix that, and maybe lower the prices a little bit, easy 5 star app. Intuitive, very helpful, and can be a quick way to learn any language's basics."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app was my top recommendation for anyone who wanted to learn new language BUT since this completely changed its ideologies like limited mistakes(5 hearts only that too after many hours), advertisements, and limited functionality like can't correct mistakes, can't do legendary without giving gems and almost have to give gems everywhere!! , which made it harder to learn regularly and maintain streaks. So I don't think now I can recommend this app to anyone!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Well my Spanish language is perfect and it's pretty useful you can learn new languages but there's one problem sometimes I get this and I have to report it it's that like the animation they are standing still and very frozen and animations are frozen but this is pretty useful to learn new languages
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo used to be an actual resource for learning, but with the introduction of the AI lessons, not only do the translations not make sense, but the voices don't either. I've been using duo for years now, learning different languages, and I'm extremely disappointed in this development. It is now doing more harm than good."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have found that the usefulness of the free version of the app has diminished over time. Previously, erroneously answered questions offered a list of community comments and discussions on the subject of grammar and the usage of words and phrases in archaic vs contemporary settings. Currently, I find that when I get questions wrong I am left without the option to consult a community's discussion within Duolingo but now have to use outside sources for the comprehension I used to find on the app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My whole family are leaning a language. I'm English, my partner is from Eastern Europe, my parents holiday in turkey. Everyone is using the family plan now and loving it. I can talk and understand family. it's fun, not too taxing, and imo worth the subscription. Particularly with the family plan! It takes a while to get going, but once you get a streak it's really really encouraging to keep going and keep practicing!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Overall, the service is great, and I've learned a lot while using it I, however, am disappointed with the balance between gem earning and the gem cost for items like timer boosts. I also am VERY concerned over recent layoffs and implementation of AI to make more phrases. I fear this app will only become more annoying to use, as I've already encountered phrases where the English translations don't make sense"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a very good app for learning new languages or advancing your native language it helps you to write what you learn even, but i find some difficulties while making the timed challenges because i need few sec searching for the word and that wastes alots of secs that can be useful later. plus it will be great if duolingo adds voice talking option so be more advanced app. finally in my opinion Doulingo is amazing app for everyvone who wants to kearn new language or advance their own lang"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it's a good app to learn different languages, the way things are arranged is really excellent.and ofcourse it's free.its like you are playing a game ,you will get rewarded after you finish a lesson. you will never be demotivate ."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It becomes very frustrating when the mic capabilities of the app on the phone rarely work. On top of that, the nit-picking when it comes to certain answers, while multiple are technically correct, makes me want to use this app less and less each day."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Less about learning a language and more about killing time on a language related distraction. It's All right as part of a battery of tools to promote exposure and proficiency, but this app will not teach you how to speak a language. It merely passes important parts of how the language works grammatically in lieu of oftentimes using turned phrases and cup and shell game style memorization."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I think duolingo is great. This app allows multiple options for learning, which is what I love. I also love that you can customize your own little character. That's so cute. The only problem I have is just the amount of ads I get for duolingo super. That can get pretty old but the ads aren't long."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is a very fun learning app, but I am concerned about how if you miss your lesson duo, a friendly bird will literally ATACK YOU, and some of my friends deleted duo like, my friend Anna. She downloaded duolingo, and she had a 692 strike *very impressive* and she deleted it because it was stressing her out she she deleted it and 1 month goes by and duo just keeps sending notifications saying ""let's practice"" and more also there are a lot of bugs in the app but I recommend it all you guys"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have a huge problem,I love the app but when I got to unit four and tried to fill the blanks. I couldn't type and there weren't any blocks to tap to fill it in,I can't continue and I hope Duo could fix it"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Hi, I am taking Korean lessons on your platform and there are some speaking exercises where I say exactly as the recording has said it but it still says it's wrong. Especially for the numbers and short words. Please fix this it. I love the app it works really good, but the issue mentioned previously happens quite often in my lessons üòîüòî"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app it helps you a lot. Would highly recommend but there are adds that the app adds in. They don't pop up often. The only thing that could be fixed is that sometimes it will add in updates taking you back several stages. Unfortunately, there is nothing you can do about it and you will have to work your way back up."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Team Duolingo; Wonderful application. I have used this app for two year. This app was helpful to communicate with foringers with their mother language like japanese, Spanish ,and Arabic. All global languages are in this app, but some of regional languages like Indian sub languages ( Malayalam,Tamil, Telugu,Kannada,etc. .)team Duolingo kindly add some more languages. This is my personal feed back."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo has become too gamified, which undermines proper language learning, and it frustratingly doesn't have useful travellers lessons so that if you are travelling to a country, whose language you don't have, you can't use Duolingo to quickly get some basic communication tips. I think this is a major fail. Travel is often the entry point to a language and it is odd that greetings, asking for directions, ordering food and drink, etc, is many levels in."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I would give it a five star. Except it continuously freezes and therefore stops my lesson too many times. I find that frustrating. Otherwise, I think it is a good way to learn a foreign language. Although I started with both French and Spanish and now I only have Spanish I have no idea why I don't still have both languages nor why it just stops running as it's changing to another lesson? So I have to stop my lesson. ü§îüòû"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Easily the best and most fun way to learn new languages for most people. Very brilliantly made, highly interactive, very adaptive. Clearly a lot of love, passion and thoughts went and still is going into making this wonderful software and it's phylosophy/approach behind it all. Just got past my 3rd week in a row of learning Japanese and it's been a breeze and very fun and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon if ever (saw in advance that it even keeps you sharp if you've done all the courses!)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Had to come back to update. Too much focus on gamification and not on teaching people language, questionable research backing when people ask for reasons why something changed and most recently deployment of AI to replace human lesson architects made the app dumber and annoying. Unbelievable sentences that no one says etc. This was the last year of my super sub."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is mostly helpful but they don't have an option for UK English, which means you have to translate to and from American too. E.g. fu√üball - football - soccer. I've lost lives for writing holiday instead of vacation before too"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"learing German it's a very motivating app, but there are a few translations that don't explain the words fully. The app needs more Proofreading. Otherwise it's a fun app that makes learing a new language more approachable. I don't think I would truly be fluent unless I actually spent some time in a German speaking country, but this app dose make me feel like I have an upper hand in learning it. If you are interested in any languages I would recommend giving it a download."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Get worse. It's one of the my favourite and best language learning app there. But quite a few weeks It's not working properly (specially in application). Please Fix it ASAP. I'm tired of buffering, while my Internet connection is so good."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is a fun app. I just am not sure the great difference when starting as a beginner in free app vs some knowledge & differences between paid or not, but the conversations so far haven't really seemed relatable or relevant in every day encounters. I also wish there were separate kids version."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I really like this app!!! Duolingo is very helpful. I told myself that I wanted to start being adamant about learning Spanish and then I moved to French. now I am doing both!!! I may go ahead and consider super duolingo because of the unlimited perks. I recommend to anyone wanting to learn Spanish or any language. it's helpful!!!!! Thanks Duo!!!!!!!!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Really enjoyed the app in the beginning however, 38 days in and this app is definitely not for the visually impaired. And the male and female voices do pronounce the words differently. You move up in rankings only to have words that have not been covered thrown in, knocking you down so you must pay. In all actuality, it's not worth your time. And in the US, the app is not in compliance with the ADA."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It keeps getting worst with every update. I had already advanced, 7 levels and I lost them Now the app takes forever to load any lesson and on times lessons I am taking the hit and I am not able to make as much lessons. Latest update basically ruined the app, if I could I would give it no stars, I changed from 5 to 1 because of the update The app just keeps getting worst, you need to fix it, now the progress keeps changing, it goes back then forward, you broke it with the last update"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Pros: Fun and intuitive Spanish lessons in a logical order. I love the way you can take tests to skip ahead to find the right level. Cons: The massive amount of made up cartoon same sex married couples makes it look like Duolingo is trying to break out of language teaching into social engineering. A lot of Spanish speaking countries don't even have such a thing as same sex marriage.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Speaking from someone who loves learning new languages when bored, this app is great (if u don't miss a day). I have learnt new languages by far and I'm aiming for Korean cuz i can't look at the subtitles and watch at the same time. It's not like i have 4 eyes. Best of the best. Recommend 100. Even though you have 5 hearts u can still lose them and buy or learn again to get them. There's premium which means infine hearts for y'all"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love using Duolingo. it has really helped me improve my French and Korean. But I don't understand why my Duolingo characters aren't moving on my phone like everyone else's and the audio is having some problems. sometimes it just cuts off while the character pronounces a word, and that makes me get the words wrong and lose a heartüò≠ pls fix thisüôèüèø"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I wanted to give it a try again since my first experience with learning Korean was bad here. Now that I was learning at beginner to intermediate level, it was going well. But nowadays the app doesn't open n so I am close to missing my streaks. All the time. I can't practice even when I make time n it's frustrating üòû. If I were to loose a streak cuz of this issue I'll be disappointed n have no choice but to give up on this app again and move on to something else."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Mostly a great app. Have been using it for a week only and the effectiveness for me is to be seen. I do like the repetitive approach, but I don't like that some of the exercises are set with timers and you need to buy diamonds to get full use of the exercise. A bit like gambling, I mean the energy of it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Duo itself doesn't explain anything. It just gives you a sentence to translate, then either says you're correct or it gives you the correct explanation. Now that was always the case, but Duo used to have a comment section where you could ask questions and read answers from people who already speak the language, but they got rid of it. For a Japanese learner, Duo might be handy cause it has all the hiragana and katakana listed. The courses themselves are worth less, though."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app got way worse. It crashes and lags fairly frequently. As other users have stated, the updates to the lessons mess up your progress quite a bit. A lot of ""new"" words are one I learned 5 lessons ago and you have to complete the lessons one at a time as opposed to the previous format which grouped them in blocks of 2 or 3. The free user discussions that made up for a lack of grammar lessons got replaced by a paid AI feature. It's like if Bethesda banned non CC mods for Skyrim"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a pity this app is rather buggy and unstable. It freezes up regularly and needs to be force-stopped to regain control. Duolingo really puts learning a language within reach. When one has the time, one can easily spend more than an hour a day learning. But in a pinch, one can easily do just 10 minutes on the bus or train to keep advancing."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible report system. I have reported multiple times a grammatically wrong English translations, even terrible audios, and recorded audios aren't picking up well, at the end of the lesson, they still want you to answer THEIR OWN CORRECT ANSWER! Really really terrible!!!!!!!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Very nice and fun app for learning. I love it but am really disappointed that you took out the grammar tips from the units. Terrible change. Japanese has 125 units that used to have grammar tips. Now it has only 8 sections with grammar tips. How is almost no information gonna help? Key phrases alone are nothing. When smth is good why ruin it? Also it gets stuck often and doesn't load the progress on quests or the timer boost gifts from friends.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is flat out LIEING to you When I heard Duolingo's translation staff were being let go in favor of AI, I thought; ""well, surely the more popular languages wont be affected, right?"" WRONG I'm relearning Spanish right now and TWICE in ONE LESSON the answers were misleading and straight up WRONG. First error: trying to correct the spelling of ""quatro""(4) to ""cuatro""(an instrument). Second error was the app telling me peque√±o doesn't mean little. Dissapointing."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a very good app for learning a new language but it can also add languages like Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Oddisi, Gujrati etc. Otherwise it's very entertaining. My main point was that it could add other languages which are used in a country or so. If we could fix this problem, I could give this app 5 star rating"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is the best language app I have ever used it's well animated characters with different voices and it's spaced repetition activities make everything super easy to learn and remember without having to do a lot of work, you do a lesson each day or once every 24 hours and it helps motivate to keep a streak going. And plus u get an easy class in highschool if ur learning French, Spanish, etc. because you have already learned itüòù ITS NOT CHEATED IF I DID RHE WORK BEFORE I HAD TOO!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this bc my friend is doing it as well, and it's just really fun bc you can choose what language you want to learn and have conversations in the language you are learning. Also, im really committed and confident in my answers, but you have 5 hearts, and each mistake you get, one heart taken off."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The best learning app. Learning with fun and Addiction. This app is almost as addicting as social media. Love the interface and the efforts put in to make this app. Well thought and perfection in every aspect. This is the best way to start learning a Language for Sure. I would give a 5 out 10. Subscription is not mandatory However it's very good for better progression of your language and interest towards the app. Go for the Subscription without a doubt.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo has created a money making plan out of ""teaching"" you. I used quotes because they actually created a method to slow your progress so that it takes you longer to learn a language than normal, but also have removed features of language learning such as vocabulary lists (let alone providing a dictionary). 2 stars for a nice app, but there shouldnt be more for preventing people from learning, even when they pay"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Brilliant app. Never realised learning a language could be such fun. Approaching 50 I was concerned my memory was going but this app has reassured me that I can still learn quickly and effectively. Can advance quite quickly and the nature of the exercises really helps to reinforce the words and phrases. Even on the free version the ads arent intrusive. Really excited to carry on learning!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A fantastic way to learn a language whilst on the go. I can practice whether on the tube, bus, walking or as a ritual when waking in the morning or last thing at night. Achieving is good for mental health, a suggestion would be to listen and practice with this app instead of listening to the miserable news on the TV or radio. YOLO"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I think that Duolingo is much better at teaching languages than people are! within just 30 minutes of using it I had already learnt SO much! and in school within the first 30 minutes I only learn like 10 new words, however, with Duolingo I learnt 75!üëåüòÅ"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I do not know why but the app is crashing quite frequently. I don't know why it crashes maybe my phone is not supporting it or maybe there is a bug? But if anything can be done please do it. Other then that, your app is really nice and I would love to use it more but the frequent crashes really make it difficult for me. Also after crashing for once it keeps lagging and the frequency of it crashing also increases. Well, ATE, the app is really nice and intertainin and most importantly,reallyuseful"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very practical linguistics for picking up Spanish with clean visuals and useful practice tools. The Super Duolingo paid version is ideal for avoiding any ads and streamlining the learning process. I was given a free 2 week trial, cancelled near the end, and was offered another free 2 week trial less than a week later."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The Arabic language should be rechecked and corrected, I don't recommend anyone to take Arabic because the course was prepared by unprofessionals and the words are not taken from formal arabic. It's a total mess. It's a very nice application but the content is not teaching the right way, even though is reported the wrong words again and again nothing is changed. Handling the app to AI is a bad poor decision and obviously many loyal users will abandon Duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a free app that allows you to learn a multitude of languages at your own pace. The app can be a bit pushy towards getting premium and keeping up your learning. It sends me reminders to do my lessons daily. Overall, it's a great app that can actually help with language development!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"One star deducted for ads and one more star for not giving alternate methods to refill hearts without top up ! The practice sessions are too long. Kindly privide alternate methods like ad watching to refill heart. There is an option where hearts can be filled by ads but it comes occasionaly kindly make it regular. Thanks. Although, great app for language learning"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The lessons are so boring and repetitive. Even though I know all the grammers and vocabulary in the lesson, all my mistakes are because of my lack of english knowledge which kinda makes doulingo an english course for me rather than German. And when I try to skip a whole session using ""jump here"" again all my mistakes are Minor and not because I make mistakes in the language that I'm learning. This makes the experience extremely boring and ineffective."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Generally good but many times it's annoying because it feels like it's more interested in keeping you using the app than improving your language skills. E.g. it asks you to spell italiano. You do It right. I understand reinforcement learning, but spelling the same word 50 times over 10 lessons is excessive. Or why would I have to become an expert in asking the question ""when do you wash yourself"" dozens of times?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Though there are some problems I find this as an okay app. Some people might complain about how lessons are repeated over and over but that's only so you can actually remember the words (probably) Also, I don't see the math and music options even when I updated the apps. Idk why this is happening"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I just want to say, adding the challenges and achievements with other people has kept me so engaged. I am a fairly competitive person, so when it comes to being first in the diamond league, it means a big deal more to me than achieving my own language goals. It's genius. Keep adding more achievements and I'm sure I'll be fluent in no time haha"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Brilliant way to pick up a language, especially if you have hectic family /work life. I have no time for courses, so this is definitely great and fun option. Love those silly duolingo reminders.üòú"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's okay for vocabulary but the content doesn't seem to be put together in a logic order I.e. Numbers, family, colours, grammar.. It doesn't give good explanations either. I bought a year subscription but won't be renewing it as a find it repetitive and boring. Moving to another platform."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Good free app; great paid app; excellent spaced out learning for some long-established language learning (not so much for oral-based languages like Hawaiian, yet. ü§ó) Would be perfect for my learning style (auditory) with a little more focused oral repetition. Different levels of achievement are good motivation to continue daily practice."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Horrible app for learning a language! AI generates the most idiotic shallow meaningless sentences! Wasting hours doing useless, repetitive ‚Äúbusy work.‚Äù Ratings are wrong, mostly by people who don't actually finish! The difficulty increases exponentially to slow progress & earn them $. Matching only runs 5% of vocab to make you spend more money. App updates blow progress. Some courses have more than 10 times the quality & content of others. Can't switch off Latin alphabet spelling. Huge waste!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"More ads than learning. I literally pass more times watching ads than learning. There is 1 ad after each lesson, a lesson takes like 2 minutes and then the ad last longer than that. I am definitely not against ads, but it should be one ad every 3 lessons. Having more advertisment time than learning time is crazy!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely relentless, sending me tons of useless notifications. I actually gave them the benefit of the doubt and allowed them to email me if my streak was about to expire. So of course they email me every night, a few hours after midnight, with more than 20 hours left in the day. Bad DuoLingo! Bad! This is why I withdraw notification permission from every app I use."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very good and cool app! However i hate apps when you have to pay to unlock a certain part of it, i know you guys need money but I dont like this way.. maybe a donation page or maybe a subscription that doubles the points, gives 10 streak freezes, maybe gives you 250 extra points. Also why are some features on Duolingo only on apple? Like Duolingo max, math and music"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app, price and learning experience. It is a good starting point! Yes, as others pointed out, there are som flaws, but the fact that we are noticing these flaws suggests that we have learned something. Each person learns different ly so it is useful that Duolingo offers a few days of using their app for free."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"the birdo is watching. he keeps track of your streak and, legend has it, if you don't keep with your practices, he takes desperate measures. in all seriousness, it's a good app. I'm learning languages. no criticism here."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Currently attempting to learn Hindi - this language, at least, does not contain readable explanations of sentence structure or grammar. There is no speaking practice option. There are many typos within the exercises. The pronunciation offerings are vague and often confusing. It's frustrating, because basic rote learning isn't for everyone - and the lack of support for a beautiful language hundreds of millions of people speak says loads for the support focus of the app. Discouraging."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love how Duolingo incorporates all of the ways you may need to use the language in each of its lessons - you need to hear and translate, hear and write, and hear and say, you need to see and translate, see and write, see and say. You also need to guess sometimes, during the intro lessons and stories, which means you have to use context clues. Being able to do that is incredibly important when actively engaging with people speaking other languages that you're not fluent in."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love this app. It has helped me impress my French teacher and I can't wait to have full conversations with her and my Dad. I love the competitive score boards, the fun reminders, the awesome badges and the encouraging streak counts. I also love the fact that you can win streak freezes from daily rewards. Plus, you don't need wifi to do a lesson! I just wish you could win more. What if I go on a 7 day trip and can't bring my phone? Other then that, a great app. Lots of fun and very helpful."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love duolingo. then they took away the ability to question a translation and get help from others. now they've laid off translators in favor of AI. the little errors I could deal with, but what's the point of a language learning app with no person to person connection? also I wish all the languages could have the resources Spanish has- stories and a podcast but the Arabic course moves at a snail's pace. ads are horrible now. clearly pushing everyone to premium. no, thanks. goodbye duo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It a great app for learning new languages. Its just that there is this one languge that native to South Africa and that is Afrikaans. I couldn't find Afrikaans as one of the languages you could learn. It would be great if new people could learn Afrikaans as it is a dying language. Thats the only problem I have, everything else is great."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Mostly I do enjoy using this application but some of the words I have found are spoken too quickly which is difficult when you are learning a brand new language from scratch. It would be nice if there was an option to slow down the speaking part of the language. When you are listening to the computer speaking the words.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is the easiest app which teaches us English and many other languages with enjoyable tasks and prizes,also it has 4 section and every section have many lessons or units. Any people can play and learn for this app. So I give 5 star to 'Duolingo' app. Thank you to 'Duolingo' app for teaches me as a teacher,but it also gives good warnings and helps me as a friend. I suggest others to install this app,it helps you very much."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Since yesterday the predictive text does not work anymore!! Why is that?? Learning a new language has been enjoyable so far, even though the grammatical tips aren't great, the English isn't always grammatically correct and other glitches. Dear developers, can we please have predictive text back before giving up and uninstalling the app??"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If we talk about the learning way its amazing! Back then this app wasn't like this in this year the new update has ruined everything I will just delete this app! Every time Asking for Diamonds üíé and whenever I play 40 Xp's it's asking for Diamonds each and every time! üò§ I have no more Diamonds left also advertising after every lesson or even practice I do it pops up of nowhere, in lessons too heart's are disappearing immediately after I play even though I had not made a mistake!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have completed lessons or special challenges (which I spend gems on), and the app will freeze on the loading screen after saying I completed the lesson. I won't get credit, and I won't get my gems back. I assume it's because the adserver is down or something because it's when the ad would normally load. Some people pay for those gems. Totally unacceptable. They also removed forums, I assume to cut down on server costs, but come on. That was probably the most valuable resource they had."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love learning on Duolingo! And the app functions well. I would just love to see more options to practice quietly sans microphone or audio. I often find myself in situations where I wish I could read or play but need to be quiet. I would also LOVE to play the matching game without getting cut off for speed. The race turns me off. I'm not going anywhere but I would love to see more lesson types added. Ty, Duo! PS, The competition of leagues really inspires me! Please keep those!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I passed the 3 levels in the level three in the ""xp ramp challenge"", but it won't record my result to pass the final level, then I would fail and redo the whole level 3 over and over again. It's so frustrating as if we are made to fail and had to buy the extra time ."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Keeps stopping , takes away my gems and does not give me points. So annoying, especially when you have done a lesson then app just restarts and does not give credit of xp points for the day. 1/2 star"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,it's a really good app. you can pick your age to how difficult it is. it is also really easy to use other than when you lose your hearts. I'm learning Spanish at the moment and it's amazing. there a basically all the languages on there and you can pick your level of speaking
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duo malfunctions often nowadays. Sometimes the lessons don't repond or move forward or give an option to exit from it. The jumbled words exercise is the latest where i found it unresponsive. Sometime i minimise it and go to other apps ,if lucky, it becomes normal. This is a bug and it has been there for a long time."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Not the greatest. While duolingo has some pretty good benefits, it's also got some cons to be wary about before installing this. 1, you only have 5 hearts. Which sucks when you are trying to learn multiple languages. 2, you can't choose if you want to join a tournament, once you do a lesson, your in it. Which sucks when you don't have enough time to do lesson after lesson. Overall, it's still a pretty good app, runs smoothly, and I can connect with my friends and my family. Definitely recommend."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It doesn't really start you off with the info you need on a daily basis wich bothers me. I'm trying to learn german for school and i have no idea when i'm gonna need to talk about an elephant to my teachers? The weekly score board stuff also bothers me a lot personally. As someone who always has to be the best it stresses me out A LOT and feel like it'd be better as an option. Also ads when you quit a lesson? really?
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! Overall, it is a great app to learn a new language for free. I started using it about 2 years ago, spending at least 30 mins on it; however, they changed the layout and I personally think that the previous one was better, easier to navigate, so now I am not spending as much time on it as I used to. If you're thinking about learning a new language in an easy and fun way, this app is definitely for you!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Woke up this morning to see the Chinese course I had been working on for 127 days has been completely changed, and a lot of the material that I had completed beforehand has been deleted, and most of the material before my streak now has been changed, introducing many words that I i do not know, meaning I'll have to go back and review every topic. No thanks."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Gamification of learning is an effective strategy if you come to terms with the fact that XP and streaks mean nothing but are motivators to keep learning;they do change behavior and push us to spend time using the app. But when the app promises double XP for 15 min and then does not give the points, then learning gamification is sabotaged; app very buggy. Awful Greek lessons make me doubt quality of other languages. Monotone lady w/ no inflection when asking questions? Œû & X pronounced wrong?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Doesn't teach the language. Only teaches you phrases, but not the grammar/rules behind it. Translations are often word for word (Google translate) rather than meaning. English is often grammatically incorrect. No explanation why you got answers wrong, just what the 'correct' answer is. Gets worse with each update."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"i feel like this app is focused more on Hangul characters than learning the language itself. my goal is to be able to learn phrases and sentences that are related to daily life and able to hear the actual words, phrases or sentences with a native speaker. i feel like this app is good only to memorize hangul characters and practice to read and end goal is to read the caption from youtube or kdrama. Other than that it's still good since i was able to practice reading in hangul characters"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It is the best app to learn any language it's very friendly and helpful for beginners. The app teaches many languages with the best teaching method that is easier to understand. It also has free plan and the super Duolingo which is paid but you can basically learn a language in the free mode like me and make progress.I recommend anyone who wants to learn any language to learn it on Duolingo
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I like the app...when it works. Don't sign up with Facebook or Google, it breaksfrequently, and there's zero support. I was about to subscribe, and it's broken so bad even a factory reset of my phone won't solve it. I am now unable to use the app without a PC. Babbel it is... sure wish support would reach out and help solve this."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Great app, but a bug has been driving me crazy recently: in Match Madness games, the cards take a good few seconds to apper, which is troublesome to say the least, when in a timed challenge. Not to mention that it happens every three pairs or so, making it impossible to play. Please fix this."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is a very good learning app. Before trying this app i thought that it would be difficult learning Spanish, but thanks to duolingo it made learning so much fun and easier. I am very thankful to my cute learning teacher. I I assure everyone that this is the best app to learn any language according to me. You can gain hearts in the process share your progress with your friends and family members and become an excellent linguist. I m gonna learn all the languages from it. hoping that you enjoy‚ò∫."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is fun and all but some times, it lags and wont open. I lost my streak freezer countless times and now i finally lost my day streak. I don't have an issue with my phone because i just bought it 3 months ago. My storage is not full yet, it won't open. I already reinstalled it and still won't open... I'm still stuck to the ""Duolingo"" screen. I am editing this review from 3 stars to 1 star. I have waited for three days for the loading screen to end and now it's demotivating me."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a fun way to learn a language. The leagues are a motivational way to make you want to keep learning. But sometimes it can feel a little repetitive, and if you take the test to see how much you know in the beginning it doesn't really work so I would recommend just doing one of the jump here tests instead. Overall, it's a good language app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"its definitely helping me to learn Spanish. duolingo starts with basic words as if your going on vacation, and the second lesson goes into more conversational language, and starts to teach grammar as well. I've used it for a little over a month, and I'm picking up words my coworkers say. stick with it, and you will get there. keep that streak alive!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really good if you're looking to learn how to speak basic stuff in other languages, but for advanced learning I'd always still recommend you find an actual teacher who teaches in the language you look forward to learn. Overall interface really engaging, reminders help you keep a streak and practice a little daily and the reward system really makes you feel good about yourself if you manage to 100% ""Perfect"" a lesson. TL;DR: It's a fun app, good for learning basics but it doesn't replace teachers"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Horrid. ...just horrid. functions don't work, audio is patchy, slower speed option doesn't function. Can only use it sparingly as am forced to use other, more responsive apps, to verify whats been taught. Endless, mindless e-mails...often inane sentence structure...zero feedback to questions...etc"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I used duolingo for various languages over the years, cause i like to learn languages for fun. However i just started korean and a lot of the times it seems like the pronunciation is completely messed up. ""Yoyo"" seems to be really hard for the app to pronounce, hut there are other words that are just a complete mess. I didn't have any issues with other languages."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Have been using this app for a couple of years now however, since the sentence discussions have been removed there is nowhere to get any explanation for things I don't understand. I fear I may have to give up Duolingo soon as I'm no longer understanding chunks of the lessons. It's a shame but I think it is a much poorer experience now hence downgrading from 5 stars to 3."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"watch the Ted talk from the guy (or one of the people) who created this app. very inspiring. this app is free and really great for keeping an AuDHD brain engaged. I have noticed some things about it that might be a bit harder if you're completely new to a language so I'm weary of trying it for languages like that for me, but if you know some or took a class before and want to refresh and learn more and motivate yourself to practice then I think this app is great for that. & the owl is adorable"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The way they intentionally waste your time with repetitions now because they ""know"" what pace you learn at better than you do in spite of paying for the app is ridiculously frustrating. If I want to fail on my own dime I should be able to. Also not a fan of the constant ""reward"" popups you can't skip/disable. I'll continue to give this app my patronage (for now) because giving people the chance to learn new languages is great, but at the rate this app is going downhill I doubt I will for long."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app, but the Super duolingo gives a huge advantage to people and hides features behind paywalls. It can be super stressful and annoying to lose all your hearts on the same question, then the app says you could have done it if you had paid x amount of money per month."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"hey dev, please! I'm really frustrated because even after completing the Lightning Round, the main Lesson, and studying Japanese letters, my XP hasn't increased. I have a booster, but it's taking up a lot of my time and making me annoyed. Plus, I lost a lot of gems while playing some Lightning Rounds. fix this immediately!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Update 2024: OK, I got used to the update. It made the app more fun, although I still think it was better before (if you are actually trying to learn a language). It's like a game now. They removed the commentadvice section, though ... Old: The new update is horrible!!! it's impossible to revise. It's impossible to learn. You spend 8 lessons being introduced to new words and then you don't get any excercises to practice or memorise them."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'd give it 5 stars but it audio ducks my music too often. So if I want to come back to a lesson, or I get a call, it will drop my audio levels. It's also started doing it even after the app is close. The volume will normally go back up to normal but now I have to start a new lesson just to get the audio back."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I think Duolingo did a disservice to its customers by removing the sentence comments. I makes it hard to recommend, even with ""Super Duolingo"" the is no help per sentence. The app is a well polished language learner. It is worth it for free, but not paid in it's current form. They can do better."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is extremely useful in learning new languages. The best use case scenario would be to pair it up with something like ""Spanish to English"" dictionary. While Duolingo is not perfect and does not teach you everything, it is a very useful tool that you should give a try. You might just find yourself immersed in a new culture! Good luck with your learning!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best app to learn the basics of any language. When it comes to motivation, Duolingo will do everything to keep you on learning your target language, and let's not talk about the marketing strategy that made this app enjoyable and lovely. I really learned 3 languages from this app. It would also be a great idea, Duolingo, if you added rooms when you can speak to people that their native language is the one that you're learning (language exchange) ü´∂üèª"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"App is generally pleasant to use, it does have some bugs though that make it difficult for learning. the main issue is the speech synthesis can't read sentences. most of the individual words are cut off so it's hard to know how the sentence sounds."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Had used for any years, but can no longer support the company if they're going to start replacing human translators with AI. 10% of staff affected or not is 10% too many when dealing with something as nuanced as language. As long as AI is being used to generate course content I'll be staying away and urging others to do the same. Exceptionally disappointed."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm using the app for many years, and it is getting worse with every update. It's focused on competition, not on learning. They removed the forum; there's no explanation on grammar; no more integration with Google keyboard. I will not renew the premium subscription for the next year."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I like this application it standalone my language deficiency although there is a such limitations in providing a language material especially in the intermediate level still this application stands out beyond the costumers needs in giving a suitable piece of language literature from different native speakers. Thanks for taking my family yet i claimed them back after I've learned spanish...
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo's language learning programs are really well made and you can learn a lot, however it's overshadowed by the forced social experience which can inhibit real progress. XP means nothing, leagues are pointless and friend quests are a distraction from what you should be working on. The app should focus more on learning languages not comparing XP with strangers. HMU if you ever add an option to disable the social experience. Until then, adios Duo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is a great app for learning new languages for free , but there should be a seperate course for fluency and new sentences in every few updates , despite of that it is a great app and helpful for basic conversions ."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really good at teaching different languages, but it's super pushy. The app wants me to practice literally every second of every day and the notifications get VERY annoying. A good thing I like about this is that every now and then, it gives you a few days of super for free."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There is a system inside that motivates you through competition. You are given XP points by practicing, and XP points are compared between users. There is even a monthly championship for the best scores, that lasts for three whole weeks. I participated in a championship, spent a lot of time to get to a first place, and this has been one of the most disappointing experiences of my life. The winner gets laughable rewards and there is even not a notification in your friend's feeds about it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"üëéüëéüëéThere was a malfunction my mobile phone, so I lost all the days counted for my progress..

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm doing Norwegian mostly on this app it's free to use, and it makes learning a new language fun like a game, which seems to be how I do it best. I used the app daily since I downloaded it. now it does have a premium version that is worth it if you find yourself making several mistakes with it. it's not time sensitive to play as long as you do one lesson per day, you won't lose your streak. the excellent thing about this is that you learn words that shouldn't offend anyone as no explicit words."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"too repetitive, leading to memorization of questions also, the app contains concurrency problems. when i click the buttons quick enough between lessons or sessions, i end up getting the next exercise wrong immediately (possibly because it takes time to disable the answer button between transitions?) or even sometimes have to have the previous lesson again because the ui update and my clicks are in a race condition. please fix this"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The loss of sentence discussion coupled with inadequate explanation (e.g. using lo, la, le in Spanish) makes this an awful experience. It used to be that I could get an explanation of why the specific example was what it was and that really helped with learning. Now it often enough feels like guessing with no explanation of why what I entered was wrong or right. I honestly don't know how Duolingo has managed to get it so horribly wrong - they should frankly be embarrassed."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Moved to using AI for lessons planned made it difficult. Push agendas that though I have no issue with, I do not support any company pushing. Was al.ost to a year with the Super plan. I'll look elsewhere though for proper lessons."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've used Duolingo for a few years now and my improvement has far exceeded my expectations. It's so easy to learn and you learn far more than you realise. I'd encourage everyone to try it for 6 months and then visit a country with that language. You will impress yourself and everyone around you for sure. Thank you Duolingo
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is by far the best way to learn a new language. It's very fun and easy to use and I can already have conversations in another language. The content and courses ensure that you remain engaged and a little bit of friendly competition helps that. I will definitely recommend the app to anyone wanting to learn and I already do. Great work developers.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's been a while since I've used Duo, but the progression system makes much more sense now, with 1 singular path (which is quite aesthetically pleasing, more like a game lobby map), and clear sections (which you can jump to with a test) for each path, indicating your proficiency in the language"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,it's such a great and amazing app to learn languages it repeat things again and again so we can learn and is just the best I recommend others to install it . there is no glitch not slow at all and is perfect for everyone we can make our own avatar and learn languages with our friends too. hopefully this review is helpful to you.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,the app runs so smooth and it has a plethora of languages. this is the best language learning app I have ever downloaded honestly. the subscription is great and it even comes with a family plan. they have gold silver and bronze every week. the way you climb up the ranks is by earning xp. it truly is built like a game. love it.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Lerrning chinese and spanish. If you have ten lessons on the same thing, chinese numbers for example, DONT REPEAT THE EXACT SAME NUMBERS FOR PRACTICE IN EVERY LESSON!! There are many examples but limited space to write. Repitition is good but teach the other words too! Lowers the quality of duolingo. Maybe add numbers above ten for spanish?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"With the new update, I keep getting the message ""you are offline"" even when the connection is on. My daughter gets the same thing on her own app It is very frustrating. Please fix this bug."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Learning a lot from this app but I'm still disappointed in it. They give you side goals to make it more fun and interesting but you can tell it's just a ploy to get you to spend money. Such as timed challenges that are impossible to complete without buying ""time boosts""."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have been trying to learn another language to connect better with my partner. Well, the daily exercises and reminders help a lot when trying to learn a new language. I think the games are practical and there's a lot of ways to earn hearts to keep going or XP.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Of late Duolingo has been misbehaving on my device. It keeps showing offline. I had to uninstall and re install. Then yesterday it cleared my streak despite not missing the day's lesson. Please resolve this issue
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm learning Japanese. The course is fun and I am enjoying it. I just wish they would have the English translation more often to make learning the words easier to remember. When you're matching words in hiragana with kanji, it would be nice to get a reminder of what the word is in English. I have trouble remembering the translations."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very easy way to learn new languages. But l am facing a problem. When l am trying to speak a sentence in its microphone, it is not able to understand it. I am sure l am using correct pronunciations as l have heard the audio many times, and there comes no noise from by background. I even speak the sentences out loud, and the microphone also shows that it is able to capture my sound waves, still they are not able to understand. Please fix this problem, or else l cannot to complete the lesson."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app for learning new languages, but.. Duolingo's game like interface really helps in igniting curiosity to learn more and the leaderboarf and other achievement awards only add to its competitiveness. But it lacks in explaining the grammar and sentence structure of a language and we have to guess them ourselves by practicing more and more. There should be some short Duolingo style lessons attached with every level and exercise that solely focus on teaching the grammar."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Learning a language changes your perception of the world. learning a language isn't just about learning words, it's the culture that comes with it. Most language learning platforms forget that, but not Duolingo. A few minutes a day for some time, and you'll be able to make simple conversation. Nice job, Duolingo!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I personally really like this app. If you want to learn a language this is the best. And there's no pressure in learning the language and you just have to give two minutes a day. I really suggest it for beginners and intermediate. Love it‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is wonderful however it's goal is to make money they should give you at least a few more hearts or a faster way to earn them but overall excellent app One thing they definitely have to change, The app says 1 hour to next heart ends up being over an hour and 45 minutes. That is very deceptive because they're trying to get you to purchase unlimited hearts."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's not really what I need in that it doesn't tell me the rules so I can understand, but works on relying on me memorising words rather than understanding their uses. I would like to be able to personalise the lessons and not be in constant competition mode which doesn't motivate me. I am unable to send them any feedback so using this avenue."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I feel like it is sad that to correct mistakes or get ai powered lessons need super duolingo. they are essential for learning. Other features like unlimited hearts i can understand.

I really hope children aren't seeing these sexually explicit products that are marketed for adults. Thank you for tamping down the super duolingo ads, but I still get way more of that ad than my husband. I don't understand why. Would appreciate if it could be reduced more. I'm never going to pay that service, I don't have the budget & seeing it after almost every single lesson is aggravating. Could the ad length be reduced as a compromise?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a great tool to use. It's definitely not the ""end of all"" but if you know how to use it, it could be very useful, even more for beginners. I loved that they started giving us the data, like how many hours I spent on the app the year prior. If I could see the list of words I have drilled, it would be fantastic. If it would give me more of my data, I would give a 5/5."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The grating sounds after each question and the way you have to press continue in between each question lower my review to 4 stars instead of 5. I'm learning slowly but well with this app. It's good.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The application is fine, but Support and Accessibility features are severely lacking. I contacted Support through email numerous times over the past months after encountering issues with their Accessibility Features not changing anything in lessons. No response.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app SUCKS NOW!!!! Changing my review after having the best learning experience, learnt two languages but now disappointed. Quality of lessons isn't good or challenging enough. Translations seem repetitive and don't help to refine your knowledge. KUDOS to Duolingo for ruining an amazing app. Not all tasks can be perfectly done by AI. App feels almost useless now. Will gladly uninstall the app that laid off hardworking employees just to cut some costs, thinking it won't affect app's quality."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Garbage app, total waste of time! It doesn't teach you, it sells you a subscription! For weeks you're repeating the same words and phrases. No grammar, no explanations, no learning, just dumb repeating. Oh yes, and also shitloads of minute-long subscription ads and annoying notifications!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After 400+ days of streak and paid subscriptio for years. Duolingo is getting worse each time it's updated. Old duolingo gives us great learning experiences. However, every new update doesn't improve the learning experience to help us learn new things, just to keep you slowly learning and keep your meaningless streak."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"After hitting a streak of 150 days and reaching Diamond league (final league) while being a free user, I can say I've learned so much. The app allows you to push through lessons even when you're out of hearts through the heart-redemption mechanic, which engages you in previously seen content, which refreshes your memory about what you've learned, and strengthening it. Each lessons comes with a grammar section. This app makes me feel proud, because knowing a language is something to be proud of."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"this app will definitely help you get started and even go up to the point where you can make daily conversations, but you still need a native speak to talk to to teach the intonations, pronunciations and alternate words to use in appropriate situations especially in japanese. I noticed that it teaches mostly informal words, but great app to have."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"With every update, this piece of **** gets worse and worse. First you implement a paywall (5 heart system), then you intentionally provoke failures with asinine or incorrect examples. Let's not even mention the constant changes of the learning system, to confuse the user. Also with the new system visiting the old lessons is just a nightmare. I had a good experience a few years back with this app. But you just got greedy as any bad corporate. Congratulations üëè go eat ****"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It helps me a lot learning new stuff, but sometimes it makes me want to delete it with how I miss a spelling by 1 letter. It's super good to use, though, as I'm on my 115-day streak. Duolingo is great to use, but be careful when using it since if you're in harder lessons, then the harder it will be. I literally missed one letter typing, and it made me lose more hearts than ever. And the fact we need to learn more lessons to get hearts is nice, but it takes more time to do that. Very helpful tho."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"After 35-day streak I am stuck with the same 30-40 words coming over, and over, and over again. I already don't feel like learning anything new. AI helping me practice the difficult words - this is totally not true because it gives me again the same words I already ptacticed hundreds of times, many times with perfect scores, and know pretty well. The new words are few and don't appear in the excercises Grammar is very vaguely explained. The app itself is fun and nice"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Very good if you want to learn just a bit of the language. It got Potential to study the full language as well. And that without attending classes.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"it's very good for beginners, but lacks specificity for more advanced learning. the biggest drawback is the difficulty in communicating with Duolingo. odd seeing as it is an app about communication. also it uses American English, not UK English, so often is incorrect."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent application, I was able to learn and understand basic German in just a few months. My only complaint is the Latin course, very erroneous pronunciation, full of mistakes. I reported that, but my messages were ignored (or maybe they could not pay competent people who know how to read it, who knows?). Still, it's free and deserves 5 stars, the best lingual app available online."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Please allow little pauses between words when trying to speak, I'm learning Korean from English, the sounds are so unfamiliar, yet the tiniest of hesitation and the recording cuts off, often I can say it but not under the crippling pressure of your unforgiving clock. Also a word only section so you can refresh just the words outside of a sentence. I'm having to use drops for that and I'd prefer not to, it be nice to practice hearing, reading and speakig just single words"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Please look into how Duolingo is firing (human) staff and instead using AI for translations and their ""language learning"" method. Absolutely awful business practice and the already awful sentences will probably get even worse over time. Other recommended apps to try out, like Drops for vocab, are abundant and apps specific to what language you want to learn (check out sign language apps as well!) can all be found online!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Limited lives discourage making the mistakes necessary to learn the language. You can watch ads and purchase more, but at that point, there are better places to go."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Easily my favorite app. I subscribe to Super Duolingo because I use it so much, but even without the subscription it's easy to keep practicing for free. I've been studying Spanish everyday for three months and I've learned over 1,000 words and can hold basic conversations with fluency. The app is very motivating with its colorful characters and study styles. I love learning more and more about the characters and language as I progress. Duolingo is an easy and fun way to learn a new language!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is super easy and achievable to learn a language using this app. It would be great if they had more accents, they have about 4-5 different accents currently and a few more would take learning to the next level. The diverse tools and resources make it easy for anyone to learn a new language"

I have an android and I can only learn new languages but I can't learn math or music unless I'm on a IOS (apple) device. Please make the math and music option of learning available/accessible on Android! I feel like diversity matters when it comes to devices than just focusing on IOS devices. Please release an update where Android users can also access the math and music learning courses!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like the lessons themselves, especially that I can slow down spoken phrases. It's a little confusing to know how much to take on in a session, what's expected or optimal for the best retention, etc. so I feel a bit left on my own as far as pacing goes."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm surprised that there aren't more reviews talking about how duolongo fired 10% of their staff and is using broken AI for the translations now (which aren't even accurate) not to mention all the bugs, lag, glitches, poor programming, grammatical mistakes, bad translations, subscriptions, ads, micro transactions, and all the other issues that make duolingo not worth having and I will not be supporting an app that relies on AI more than humans."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Using Duolingo while listening to music in the language you're studying works very well for remembering specific words. Slow animations in the match madness screws me up because it's still highlighting the old word when I'm hitting a new one, even if it's the right match it's still fading off the last word. Y'all know what I'm talking about"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is even easier to use now than a year ago. Make sure you look at the notes for each unit; they are easy to overlook but invaluable to learning the material. Missed and weak words are reviewed and practiced targeting/customizing what you need work on which speeds things along. And the whole experience is gamified which can be motivating and fun. It's a very well designed app.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It is not so bad, but then it is at the same time. The first and only good thing about the app is that there aren't as many ads. Why do you need hearts to learn? Why not just be able to learn for free and not have to buy super, which is already costly. Also, can you make it so that streak freezes are fewer gems My biggest regrets Linc L"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is a good app. It helped me learn 2 new languages accompanied by my current one. I had a great experience using this app and it helped me in many ways. It also goes at a slow pace, for the learners that take their time to learn the languages. And the fact it takes a quiz at the beginning to see how advanced in said languages you are learning is actually quite helpful. And the leaderboards are a good source of motivation to keep learning and to try your best to reach the top. üëç 5‚ú©"

I would have upgraded to the Premium family version, however I decided to abstain due to lack of transparency in their pricing. When you want to upgrade you can select your package and get 2 weeks free, however before selecting the 2 weeks trial you are not presented with a price, I have looked but I cannot find any price information on their web or in the App"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Don't know what's going on at the moment. Have been using Duolingo for over 4 years with no problems. But this last week since updating, it syncs everytime I go onto it and takes me back 5/10 lessons. The lesson I am currently doing I've completed at least 6 times. Getting really fed up now. Any suggestions please."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like the way it's currently set up so instead of doing the same basic lessons super fast to earn xp, you are kinda force to continue advancing your language learning. They've gone in and made it easier to keep your streak and seem to have made most timer boosts no longer start automatically when you log in/receive the boost reward."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's fine, but it glitches a lot. Like every few word bank lessons it will only let me select two of the six or seven words necessary to complete the prompt. And I either have to choose to submit my answer with said error and lose a heart, or quit and lose all my progress on that lesson. Very annoying, especially since I've reported the issue a few times already."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"For me Duolingo has been a great addition to my lessons, that I have with a teacher. It helps me practice sentence structure and motor skills. The ease & flexibility of the app has me deploy guerilla tactics, to learn during down times, or spare (non productive) moments, when I can grab my phone review my progress."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to be amazing, then they deleted all the comments and all the explanatory parts. Now when i don't understand why an answer was right or wrong i have to Google it. The comments were a major part of the understanding element as duo sure isn't there answering your questions (or emails) on why it is one version word not another. Its now basically a guessing game until you eventually guess why it is that answer. That's ok on lower levels but not higher levels if you really want to progress."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a great app for learning new languages. After learning Spanish in high school and forgetting a lot of it, duolingo has helped me learn a lot.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've used this to learn Korean (and Japanese). While I found the Japanese lesson is good, the Korean lesson is not! The lesson jumps are too steep. You are forced immediately to learn the characters while I was after more practical uses. If it's done correctly I don't mind but some of the words are romanjised incorrectly and there is no romanji options half way through level two for new words. I mean it's only level 2! The new words are not listed! Quite disappointed after I paid subs"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have used this app for several years and I love it, but recently I noticed a glitch/bug.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"In learning French. I love how the app keeps being improved, changed. That means I don't get bored and it doesn't get repetitive. My only quibble is the English is American English (spelling and nouns), and not British English. This means I have to translate twice at times. Otherwise excellent."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm doing bad progress in Duolingo right now, I lost my 64 streak because when I was about to fix it with gems, I misclicked and I lost it so that discouraged me to do more Duolingo because it took me hours of long work to do and now I got to do it all over again and also I forgot everything on the language course and I really need help, also I am doing very bad progress on the leaderboards, I always get demoted. So that's all Duolingo, I hope that you help me."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good system, really repetitive if you need it to be to practice the difficult bits. you have to work out the complexity of the grammar yourself though and a word search function would be really useful. a great way to start and get the basics but you do need to find a native speaker."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love that it has bite size lessons and reviews that are quick. those little things keep me going every day. there are streak freezes so if a day gets passed me I can stay on my streak.

It's nice to know that you can take as much time as you want to learn any language. recommend 100%"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've been using duo for years and it's helped so much with my language goals. the little games and the daily streak motivate me to practice every day.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been using it since a couple of years now and it's been working really well. I mean it's just as fun as playing a game but you're learning a new language too by just hardly spending 5 minutes per day onto this. Whether you're studying or working, you can spend a few minutes if your time onto this, it's really worth it! Plus there are 40+ languages in this app/game so you can do it forever and learn new language whenever you're done with the course. Highly recommend this app!"

Then, I found this app that allowed me to correct my mistakes and speak to the rest of my family in spanish with ease. I absolutely love the fact that I can start my course using the knowledge I have with spanish. This allowed me to fix the mistakes I was making during that time. I highly recommend this app"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love it. But after 1300 days I find it boring, with too many ads, I'm not learning anything useful or practical sentences. I can't navigate to review sections like I used to and basics are now hard to find because duo just makes stuff up or changes it without actually explaining why the sentences use certain words. After 3 years my sister asked could I have a simple greeting conversation and I realised I knew the word for an ant, dolphin and a bee but couldn't ask what your name was."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Recent updated makes me less challenged. I no longer see how close I am to a new achievement goal. It just shows me what I have achieved. This is demotivating since I used to realize oh look I'm 10 away from the next level and I would focus on finishing that achievement level for that week. Now it says achievement level 3/9 gained on x date but I cant see what the next goal is or if I'm close. While if it is an achievement I've yet to gain the first level, you share how close I am to gaining."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have lived in Germany for two years now and Duolingo has really helped me improve my German a lot! Supplementing my German language course with this app has made it easy for me to apply what I learn in class. And through repetition in turn makes me more confident in real world situations where I used to be reluctant to do so.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"After I do a certain amount of lessons, the app starts glitching out and becomes excruciating slow for no reason at all. The amount of times I've had to restart the app and quit a lesson because of this is infuriating."

I hope you guys can solve these issues fast."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Well made app for those who wants to learn the basics of a new language. I agree with what most people say, it's shouldn't be the only avenue for learning a new language since it's gamified so much that it's still beneficial to have a formal classes instead. However, in my case, Japanese, there's an option to turn off romanized pronunciation so it's a good challenge. Hope that this app will improve more in the future though."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I am very happy that I got this app. If you are looking to learn a language perfectly this app is not for you. If you want to learn the basics of a language enough to speak it generally this is the place to do that. i have read many complaints and I have seen that many of them were addressed. one complaint I have is that for the multiple choice things where you choose words to translate they capitalize the word that comes first accidentally offering a hint.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've actually really liked it. I'm still in the rookie stages but I think I could recognize and maybe use some words irl. Nice different forms of repetition. It's been easy to use Duolingo instead of a social media app and I feel more satisfied with my time spent. I wish there was an option to pick front loading employment focused words for food service, retail, or office work rather than school based vocab. Faster progression to writing cognates from multichoice would be nice too."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Since I updated duolingo all my legendaries gone aside of that it shows me that I studied courses and lessons which the structure and vocabularies are so different from what it was before! It's very annoying

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is amazing, I never thought I could have so much fun learning a new language. I just have one simple gripe with it, the fact that Portuguese is automatically from Brazil. It sucks that European Portuguese people that want to learn a new language through Portuguese have to accommodate to a dialect instead of their own language. It's helping in the slow death of the European Portuguese language since it incentives even foreigners to endulge in the Brazilian dialect instead of the original."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"the app is very good and works well. no bugs or anything. my 4 stars is for duo itself. im not a fan of the stories which consistently use words you havent yet learned. additionally they constantly update the ""course"" content in ways that are frustrating and make me feel like im not learning the content."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The way Duolingo teaches language, it really sticks with you and works. I've tried many other methods in the past only learning the way a child learns their native language, insignificant bits and pieces you hope to eventually be able to put together. Duolingo teaches in a way you really learn. After a small effort I can have basic conversation with native speakers and within the group that is learning with me. I am very happy with Duolingo, look forward to mastering this language, and another."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I am struggling with understanding certain concepts due to the lack of clarity. No explanation provided. For example, the concept of are you/do you in Turkish takes more than one word. The app failed to clarify which one for which case. That's why I got stuck on a certain level. I can't pass it because every time I do mistakes, I don't know why it is like that. So I can't avoid the same mistakes later. This is absurd."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"if you don't pay it's pretty impossible to start a language. I love it for practicing my average Spanish. it's been difficult starting Hindi but I am slowly learning. I like it better for practicing than learning it just throws you in and you start messing up, so if you aren't paying would be really difficult to push forward. but it does well making contests that push incentives to work everyday and language needs daily practice. so to most I would recommend"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is great for learning a language iteratively. I recommend trying it and seeing if it is for you. However, the app can be SO annoying. It seems to be engineered this way, you'll find the annoying bits soon enough. I also heard they were scrapping a number of employees to make way for AI. That is probably not going to go well long term. It has asked me for around 500 days to rate it. I really didn't want to. So here we are: an average rating, non-specific feedback and conjecture."

Not to mention the Navajo language sounds like it was recorded in a basement. Czech doesn't even have voiced lines which, to me, is mind boggling. They found a person to voice the Navajo language and not Czech? Which is easily 3x more common? Plus the leagues are definitely rigged, if you have super, you get top 3. If you dont, good luck."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"A mediocre service so far. I took Spanish for 3 years in high school and that's the only reason I know some basics of Spanish grammar; in the absence of that, Duolingo won't actually teach you the underlying grammar lessons. They merely shove questions down your throat and hope you understand it. They won't bother actually showing the grammar or difference between various sentences. Be warned, but it's not that bad."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a popular language-learning app, including English. It offers a gamified approach with diverse exercises. Users appreciate its accessibility and effectiveness for basic language skills. However, some find it less comprehensive for advanced learners. Overall, it's a solid choice for beginners and casual learners."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo recently laid off a bunch of their translators to use AI translations. I regret finding out about this after my annual subscription renewed because I would have cancelled beforehand if I had known this was coming. Google translate cannot do Norwegian grammar. I don't know or care if Norwegian courses specifically are impacted by this, I'm sure most languages that are are going to lose a ton of nuance and accuracy. Human translators are vital and irreplaceable for language learning."

Some small bug fixes required tho. 1. After I get an xp boost, when I tap claim in shop, the app freezes on a blank screen. 2. When I complete an exercise/lesson through the notification tap, it gets stuck on loading screen after claiming rewards."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I feel like there is no progress after month, massively ineffective. There are task where I put the sentences together 100% correctly but it says it's wrong. I have the suspicion that this app is part of why am thoroughly depressed. The streak thing has become somewhat of an obsession and it is not helping my mental health at all. Seems like they put most of their money into marketing like apple, but maybe like 20% of their finances into the actual app. I could rage so much more, but no space.."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duo is a pretty good use of learning a new language and I've been learning Japanese well, I recommend this to people who want to learn a language at an easier difficulty. The only problem is a lot of the offered help besides basic lessons are through a paid membership, besides that it's a good app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app but the annoying ""5 in a row! 10 in a row!"" interruptions can't be switched off. Accidentally turning off listening tasks can't be undone for 15 minutes (and often occurs when trying to dismiss the annoying interruptions I mentioned)."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app has gotten ridiculous with ads and even the lessons are structured to make you fail so you'll buy the paid version. You go from learning basic words from unit 1 into complex sentences with verbs you've never seen before in the same lesson. I just expired all 5 lives in one lesson and the only way to continue was to spend half of my ""gems"" that took me over a year to accumulate. It's ridiculous. If I'm paying for a language app, I'll pay for one that's proven to teach whole language"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like this app, I have learned a lot of German words since I downloaded it. I hope the creators read this review because I'm sure a lot of other subscribers have this same issue. Here is my issue: while practicing speaking, I have intentionally missed pronounced words or have used totally different words to see if tell me I'm wrong. Well guess what, I still to get it right. If it doesn't tell me I'm wrong then I will learn to speak wrong. Please fix this issue thx"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's honestly just a very enjoyable way of learning any language in the world, and it's efficient. Ive had the app for a day, and I can already say multiple sentences off the spot."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Overall not bad but one huge annoyance is how it handles mistakes, will not explain why you're wrong, even after getting the same thing wrong five times in three lessons. Also when completing 2 daily quests at once it only gives credit for 1. And finally every time it gives me my 5 weakest words to practice extra they are, in fact, some of my strongest words that I've never gotten wrong. Don't know how you can screw that up that bad but it's pretty bad programming to be that a** backwards."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's very good for learning languages but, can you or the team behind this app add Tagalog? I have an online friend of mine that lives in the Philippines. It will be very useful for me so I know what he is talking. He can speak English well but sometimes he gets a bit quirky and starts speaking his language. For now, I'm gonna rate it 4 star until I'm satisfied. Thank you --Morisla"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A fun and engaging app but best used as a supplement to formal language learning. You won't become fluent or even be able to speak well using Duolingo alone. However it is excellent for vocab aquisition, repetition, and practice which are essential to learning a language. Plus its super fun and addicting too!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The new version is such a downgrade, honestly. The lessons are not as intuitive as they used to be. Sometimes you get a lesson full of new words and sentence structure without the new word in the sentence being underlined/translated or the new grammar rule being explained properly. It now feels more like playing a language guessing game with a bot than actually learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Russian / Polish. Fun & easy, if you make sure you go in with some knowledge of the language first as there's no real TEACHING going on, more like flashcards for reminders which is no good if you happen to be a total beginner. No explanation of the seven cases, which is crucial when understanding Slavic languages. More of a game than a serious language app as it is not instructional enough. Also, I noted there are very silly sentences to learn that are useless IRL."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Can't believe I waited so long to try it out! Gives me the same feeling as mobile games, except I'm actually learning useful information! So far the learning structure and lessons seem to be done well, with a mix of selecting, typing and speaking responses. Great app!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Good app but few issues. I've tried to subscribe monthly many times but no success. Forcing me to buy yearly subscription. I don't want to pay huge amount yearly so I gave up for subscription. The other issue some of the practicing sentences are really ridiculous and you will never come across in real life. Example: ""My grandfather is a child"" or ""It's a pink skeleton"""
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Will the UI and game is nice, the learning structure as well as the vocabulary chosen and turn of phrase leave a lot to desire. There should be vocabulary only modules because that's really where the app shines. Forcing the user to learn random sentence without adequate teaching of grammar, is completely useless."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I got this before they started using AI. I can already see where it is. Some of the sentences don't make sense. I hope they realize the usefulness of actual people. I also miss the old version that gave us more options. This ""streamlined"" version is just annoying. Bring back the good version!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Cannot get speech exercises to work at all reinstalled app checked mic settings keep getting 'Hmmm that does not sound right' message fed up with it. Have sent bug report but still no help offered.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I like that I have options where I want to learn instead of just having to follow a set guideline. Though the widget is my favorite part of the app. I enjoy seeing a new image of the owl trying to convince me to learn and how it changes throughout the day. Let him embrace the meme to the fullest extent!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I was really enjoying the app with my 11-year-old. Then, something happened after an update, which interrupted our progress together. My lessons look completely different from hers, and now she's discouraged from learning because it was enjoyable doing it together. I would like to know how to undo this if I somehow activated it by accident."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Giving it a one star because the ads are getting out of hand, and in a recent update they decided to disable many keyboard functions (at least on Android), like spell check, which is incredibly annoying when the app is so picky and fussy about little spelling mistakes. Might add stars once they fix this."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Extremely good app, or website, for coming up to speed and extending one's knowledge of a language. The revision exercises are useful, but after a few revisions the same exercises keep appearing so that one gets to know the answers by heart. More effort should be put into varying the content of these revision exercises."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Fantastic app for learning, makes it easy to understand and associate words with their respective counterparts languages. Only complaint is the heart system, but it does serve as a means to encourage you to actually think about your answer instead of just pressing whatever."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a great app to learn a language. Everything is great and extraordinary, but I think if Duo do not go ahead too fast it will be great. Since in each unit lessons get harder and new words show up, there should be some more practices to learn better and memorize them either."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have never been more committed to learning a new language! Duo encourages you and adapts to your learning pace. Other than the occasional Super Duolingo add, the app has no adds and runs very smoothly. Great for travel or just learning a language for fun. Definitely recommend!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have been trying to learn a third language and feel that this app has been useful for someone who can't find any classes nearby, also its pretty fun on the challenge aspect, so far it's been accurate for short term travel where I have a concept of the grammar or atleast basic phrases."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It is a very useful app to all. From this app we can learn some many different languages in a easy way. Ans this app mainly help to travellors. They have to known the language to interact with others.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Too many ads. The best thing about this app is that the content is palatable and it encourages you to do exercises. However it doesn't really do a great job of teaching, especially when it comes to grammar. In addition, the amount of ads makes this app nearly unusable. For many languages, anki is a better option"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Duo used to be the best learning app but not anymore they'll give you only 5 hearts and doesn't care about others !!! I'm learning French if I spent all my hearts in French i can not access to other languages.. I thought of learning mandarin but they'll only give 5 hearts for literally everything this is so annoying and not fun to learn
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love the idea of turing learning into a game. This is a fantastic way to learn or practice a language. I love using Duolingo to pass time when waiting or just wanting to practice and get a refreshing on the language I'm learning.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It was amazing until bugs came such as the duolingo characters not talking,the lesson not working,and not showing my xp on the leaderboard and making me look like I am last hope they get an update for these bugs but I still love the game for how they teach me so nicely its been 3 weeks and I know alot of french the bugs dont bother the lesson so if you want to learn from duolingo it is a great choice and that is why I gave it 4 stars if they get an update I will give it 5 try it,it is amazing"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"honeslty lretty good for how many languages it offers but there also tend to be inconsistencies which with as many lessons and such they have youncant expect them to be perfect, and some of the sentences or the way they teach some words just wouldnt be used that way by a natural speaker, i also wish that more was free but they are a business so the need to make money, but all in all 7 out of 10 could be better and less mistakes but u can help fix them which is nice soüëç"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's a good app and I get that the free version has to be supported by ads but it is RELENTLESS. By trying to make it so annoying that in the end people scream ALL RIGHT! I'LL PAY! you're gonna push customers away. I'm very close to uninstalling and never coming back. There has to be a middle ground.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"At some point when learning a new language, you just have to memorize a ton of words...This app is fun to use, even just a few minutes at a time throughout the day. The lessons can be repetitive, but that's how you memorize new words, by practice and repetition. I'd say the app is best used as supplemental practice since grammar lessons do not seem to be available. Overall I think the app is great, I would definitely recommend it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is fun! It's an excellent tool to learn a new language! I have recently upgraded to paid version and am enjoying learning thoroughly! With pictures, animations, speech, listening, practice sessions Duolingo is Super! Fantastic for on the go (mobile) learning at your own pace! I have no hesitation in recommending Duolingo as a language learning tool! Cheers!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have always wanted to learn another language but lacked the motivation. Duolingo makes it so easy and engaging, it's very well thought out. You don't have to think about it, the progression is all taken care of for you."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is a very wonderful application for learning the language you want through fast and fun educational curricula, but I hope that there is a way to activate the premium version through exercises or by paying gems instead of money. There are many who want to learn but do not have a way to pay."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's gotten super bad in the past few months. I understand they need to make money, but it's not super frustrating if you're not paying the subscription. It doesn't deserve to be called a free app, it might as well just call it a free trial."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It was a 5 at first, then they updated it and I reduced it to a 4 because I wasn't a fan of the new UI. It's a 3 now because they've added match madness lessons that are quite literally impossible to complete without purchasing extra time. I even tested my theory by handing my phone to my bilingual, Spanish from birth wife who also couldn't complete the lesson in time. That is a scam if I've ever seen one. I'll still be using the app to learn Spanish, but I won't be renewing my membership."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's not just a good tool for learning languages, but a tool which is improving with time. From the courses I've tried, Spanish, French and German are the most advanced. Language skills I've got with Domingo helped me several times in different countries even when I was at the Beginner level."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo just had a massive update but it is terrible. BRING BACK THE OLD DUOLINGO!!!!! Okay I've found this review again and I still like the older version but this one is still great, an I have gotten used to it, and a knew user wouldn't know about the old one anyway. 5 stars again."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"In the beginning, the app was great for real, but recently, unfortunately, it started to change. I don't know why, and they don't care about the comments that the users write. Because they have a lot of users . I'd appreciate if you put choices to hide or show up any sentence under any step if any user wants to get over it because the word is easy or something like that because we need challenge ourselves not to be very easy, and we need speaking more than anything else."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"great way to learn a language, interactive and dare I say it fun. I am still using the free version and that encourages me to get the exercises right as you play it like losing lives \ hearts means you have to wait...but I like that way even if it is at the sacrifice of the ads. great app . kudos to the dev team."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Dear Duolingo Team, Duolingo is an outstanding app. I would however love to see it being upgraded so I can achieve max in the language I am learning. For five stars, please fix the bugs. The app keeps uninstalling itself after few days...."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I don't like as much! The ads are distracting and annoying. Then I have to dismiss the ads to upgrade duolingo after hitting ""no thanks"" 3 times I finally get back to learning. I used to like duo but not as much now. I get frustrated waiting for the ads to be over."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"great app for learning another language! doesn't exactly get as in depth on why verbs are conjugated the way they are as a classroom setting might, or when to use accents on certain words/ letters (at least the free version) but it is very easy to use and very educational so far!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Helpful with verbal and written exercises but there's too much repetition on phrases and words which probably wouldn't be used in real interactions in the target country. Also, the free version has too many ads and the heart and gem system is distracting and irrelevant to the main purpose which is to become proficient in a language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Seems like it's going to be a good app to learn with. The only problem I have is I'm using the free version and you can only make 5 mistakes a day. After that you have to wait for the next day, use diamonds to refill your hearts, or upgrade to the paid version. It also resets the lesson if you don't refill your hearts. This makes it much more difficult to learn a new language. Also from what I have researched, if you are going to pay for a foreign language app, there are better options."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am learning both Arabic and Spanish. Fun little app!

"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The vocabulary is insufficient. It lacks consistency. Just like in a Tagalog word ""inuman"", their English version is ""bar"". But when it comes to the portion, Identifying the image suddenly the English word ""bar"" is also exact Tagalog/Filipino translation instead ""inuman"". This mobile app needs to be updated according to all credible resources. I have all the screen shots as a proof."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great app. I am learning Russian on it. Thank you Duolingo for making it fun. I was also learning Latin (fun) and Polish (I stink at Polish). I realized the similarities between Polish and Russian thanks to the app- that was interesting. I do language challenges with my daughter. All good.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The Italian course is decent to learn some vocab and basic phrases. The Japanese course does not have a good process for teaching the language. You need to use external resources to learn both well, but in the Japanese case Duolingo has not got a good method for learning and review. Super would be a waste of money for Japanese learners"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"An amazing app i have ever used, I enjoy learning language, and Duolingo is the perfect app to do so. The great thing is you learn while enjoying. I highly recommend Duolingo for those who to become POLYGLOTS and learn new language. üî•‚ù§Ô∏èüëå"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The learning and programming and etc is fine . But payment, the language, and culture learning is really bad. I learned Spanish from people from Spain or other native speaking countries. After using Duolingo the pronunciation and spelling a large amount of the words and things are wrong completely. If you go to Spain and speak Duolingo Spanish you will ask for a muffin and get a cookie. Do not use Duolingo for actual Spanish if you want to do it for fun or a challenge that's fine. Not for native"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The old version of the app was much better. Now I feel like new words are introduced without ever sharing what the words translate to. I no longer feel like I'm learning. I deleted the language and went back in to start from the beginning to refresh my knowledge and it is vastly different

If you're a beginner learner, it may take a little while to learn your chosen language but with Duolingo, it is possible that it can speed up the process with practice everyday, keeping up with your streaks and everything! Thank you so much Duolingo for helping me with learning the language I have been dreaming of being able to understandüòòü•π!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app overall, makes learning fun and rewarding. The daily refresh for Cantonese and Chinese has no variety unfortunately, as it repeats the exact same phrases every day under the pretense of working on weaknesses. More variety and review of all learned words would be nice!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I haven't gotten very far in the exercises yet (I'm still on the ""Rookie"" exercises), but so far I'm impressed. The short, bite-sized exercises are convenient and unintimidating, making it easy to practice daily. The lessons keep circling back to earlier material, ensuring that you don't forget it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The recent change to AI based translation (and subsequent laying off of a majority of translators) is disagreeable on both an ethical and quality assurance standpoint, especially considering that Duolingo already has the appearance of being understaffed with how poorly they respond to corrections.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo decided to change the way it interacts with the keyboard, and no longer allows voice to text.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Since I can't get a refund, then I'll just speak here: With the recent move of Duolingo to use AI instead of employing legitimate human translators, I have grounds to believe I am using a defective app, one that is not worth the subscription. I have been noticing errors in the past weeks, which is only confirmed by Duolingo's use of AI. Sometimes, correct answers are marked wrong and with no explanation, because forums have been shut down as well. AI cannot replace humanity in translation."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's okay. It can teach a few new words, but it doesn't help you maintain if you are knowledgeable and near fluent already. It does not account for regional jargon, even if it is grammatically correct and labels it as wrong. I need a better program."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a really good app to learn different languages but having to do lessons everyday is tough and sometimes loose our streaks because of that, either way i think its a great app and this little green bird is absolutly adorable"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I wish I would have discovered this app ages ago. I tell all of my friends and coworkers about it, because would wouldn't want to learn a new language for free?! Duolingo is great, free and makes learning fun. The little green owl mascot is adorable and helpful in reminding me to do my daily lessons. Don't waste any more time!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is truly learning with fun. They try hard to socialize and make users feel good and loved. It is also a free and easy way to learn tons of new languages. Only that there are some little errors that need to be fixed. There are some sentences I was marked wrong even though I actually got it right. I had to write it the wrong way to get it right by the system. Though it's a few out of many.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The perfect app. It has really helped me and its only been 9 days. The lessons are fun and there is barely any ads. It has all of the languages I want. I'm currently doing Korean and Spanish and I love it!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoy this app as a way of learning, however I that like the lack of explanation on grammar is quite frustrating, especially for gendered languages! Also the Russian numbers above 10 aren't recognised on speaking exercises - I've seen a lot of people have found the same bug and it's never been fixed."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is the only resource I have found that actually drills this into your head. I have taken 5 year breaks and come back to this and still remember what I learned. And it's done in a way that isn't boring, so it never feels like a chore. it's always fun to do more lessons and practice and bump myself up the leaderboards!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is the perfect app to learn a new language, but since it is just an app it has its own limitations. I won't say you could become perfect in a language just with this, but it really helps to some extent. No bugs yet, no unnecessary spending, it's just coolüî•‚ú®"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app. The annoying reminders are an important and helpful feature. my only complaint is how slow it takes you - I would like to be able to dive into deep water and drown a little, and use its great practice system to get my accuracy up."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It takes a fun, interactive approach to language, which helps build vocabulary and the ability to discern cadence of speech and accents. It helps point out mistakes and give pointers for corrections. I love Duo's colorful cast of characters, too!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's actually pretty good now but it would be better if they had a list of all the vocabulary used in the lessons and teaching a few grammar rules although u can kinda pick it up as you go. But, bring the comments back idk where they went but they were so useful."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm here to say that this app is amazing, but if you are looking for less widely spoken languages, then you need to go somewhere else. For example, it has Brazilian portuguese but does not have European Portuguese, which is the language i actually wanted to learn. But otherwise, it is a great app, and it has really helped me."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"All in all, it's a fun way to learn. Kinda annoyed that I got to the massive wall of learning the characters of Japanese and don't have more words to learn at the moment(without just skipping the characters). Wish it was more mixed in. Edit: they've fixed the xp boosts not working with character lessons, so I've adjusted my score"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It loads very slow, does not work on recognizing speech. Great potential. Great idea, it works, but it could be a lot of better. For once i would do printable exercise, writing down on paper improve your memory in a way a digital cannot."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Not as good as it used to be. AI seems to be messing up the quality of the language content. Repetition is necessary for learning, but the new pathway set up seems to keep you doing the same things forever. Maybe still good for beginners but towards intermediate level it's frustrating and feels limiting. I feel held back. Also agree with others about grammar. It's a shame that there's no Eng to European Spanish available as speakers in Spain laugh if I use Latin American vocabulary."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It used to be a good app before, but all of a sudden my 152 days streak started over from day 1, despite the fact that, I didn't miss even a day this week and I have 2 streak freeze equipped. Pls duo do something about it so I can change my review"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It is a great tool to learn new languages. I'm currently learning Japanese and Chinese. However the free experience is really lacking. It takes 4 hours per heart to regenerate and you get interrupted by an add after every lesson. As a free user you will also miss out on a lot of extra lessons that cost gems since they are hard to obtain. I understand they want people to upgrade to a paid plan but making the free experience unbearably annoying is not the way to go.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo has taught me more Spanish in 7 days than I learned in school. The graphics, vivid colors, and sounds appeal to my learning style. I have been able to retain so many words both visually and phonetically. I'm super glad I found this app. The free version is great, but there is a paid option that offers unlimited hearts. both options will work. I have all of my friends and family hooked."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have been practicing duolongo for 100 days and it is helpful. Although, for the last month I've been doing the end of the Unit 1. But it isn't because it is difficult, it is because the program never remembers when I ended. All the time, it was dropping me in the last revision of unit 1 and then I was finishing it and I was promoting to unit 2. But today, it said that I should start all the last course unit, without being able to say that something is wrong to staff, which gets on my nerves."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been using the app for a month and started to like it. However, I've noticed it introduces topics that may not appeal to everyone. I recommend avoiding controversial subjects to make the app more inclusive across cultures!! PS: Replace unbeneficial stories with ones that add value to the learners!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The free version has adds yes, but the number and length of the adds is reasonable for the value offered by the app. I would say it's an example of balenced freemium done right."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Sometimes the audio is not working properly but it is a beautiful app to learn languages.It has a separate button that shows you the mistakes you have done in the session so far,so it is easy to correct mistakes.It is the best learning.It also gives you remainders if you forget to attend that day."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great app overall which i am using to learn basic german. I already have finished the first section and my journey is going smoothly. The only problem I have been having lately is that after lessons it is showing me ads of those fake casino/gambling apps. Like I said Overall a very good app to learn the basics of languages. PS the fake languages are insane
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm on my 27th day streak and still really enjoying using this app. It's very easy to use and has great little challenges to help increase my learning. I've used other apps and methods to learn another language in the past, but this is by far the most committed I've been and plan to continue. We have upgraded so me, my husband, and our children are all learning as well."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"i used to enjoy finishing and completing lessons on this app, until the hearts system was implemented. Because of this new hearts system, if i make a mistake more then 5 times a day i am sent to practice, which is futile for me as the practice questions are always brain-dead easy. aswell as this, the ads are so out of control and unskippable. The amount of 30-60 second ads i have got infuriates me, and puts me off from the app. I have had the urge to end my streak for weeks now if this continues"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Fun, addictive and perfect short lessons for my scattered ADHD brain so its easier to focus and achieve my goals. Learning basic Spanish for a holiday coming up in a few months and loving it so much i may even in the future consider learning other languages aswell :) dont need to be fluent, just good to have enough communication and understanding to feel more conected to a country and its people when you visit i think :)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is very easy to use. you can learn to speak very easily you will also be able to write the answers which were wrong Duolingo is the best app to learn a new language I don't know how much time it will take it depends on you if you read good you will know the language completely And thank you very much Duolingo for such a good, easy and playful way to learn any language in the World Share this app with your family and friends so they can learn new languages THANK YOU DUOLINGO ‚ù§Ô∏èü•áüèÜ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is great. I am learning German and I learn a lot. Problems: I bought the Super Duolingo pass and it is so much easier with it. There's no games, so you can't learn in a more fun way."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"They don't really teach you pronunciation, or how to use it. They string you along, repeating the same lessons, it gets kind of tedious. I do learn lots of words, but not how to use them correctly. They say an amount per month, then bill e for the whole year, so you're stuck with it, even if you aren't happy with it. I would suggest learning type options before paying Duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The best part is...it dosn't haves any subscription or ads nd it's completely free of cost...best for learning different languages...as it has many quizes and challenges which makes it more fun to use...overall it's a good app...üëçüèºüòä
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I suggest the free version only, the constant leagues every week and nowhere to go beyond diamond(which I never made it to), became boring at best. To have school, apple and cheese at every level was mind numbing. The fact that a Tik Tok that I saw the other day, made me completely over this app and experience speaks volumes. I had super until December of this year and I cancelled anyway, I'm no closer to being able to order my meals at a Mexican restaurant now than I was before I started. Smh"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is great mixture of games and learning. The app is great. You have to get the full version to truly appreciate it and get the full experience. It's fun, challenging and when you start to understand pieces of conversation in the language you're studying, it's exciting."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Unfortunately, it seems you cannot use it from two personal devices with the same account - a phone and a tablet. Password change is a lost cause. I don't get it. If something is wrong with my account, shouldn't a get an email instead of a freezing app? Beyond disappointed. Technically, the sign-on process is by far THE WORST I've ever seen."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app for language learning and would recommend. However, recently after deciding to learn a different language I'm being given questions on words I'd not come across even though I had mentioned that I was learning the language for the first time, and my guess work can only take so far. I only experienced it with one so far, so it's probably not prevalent on other languages maybe"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Frustrated that regular practice of 30 minutes twice a day isn't enough to stay in my league. It's becoming too frustrating. Am I being pitted against super learners? This app used to be better when it was more rewarding. This is more frustrating
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,it won't let me use the app without creating a profile and I want to connect it to my Facebook. It sits a loads and never refreshes or actually connects. I've already given permission to connect so what is the issue. I am attempting to delete my current account now because it made me create one without connect to socials and even though you claim I can through setting there is no option to delete or disable account. I need your damn assistance but Noone responds either.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This App has been my most enjoyable and successful attempt at learning a language. All you have to do is keep going through your lessons and Duolingo will deliver you to fluency. You're still looking at a long investment of your time of course, but Duolingo will make you not care so much about that. I recommend this app üíØ%"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Easy to follow, no pressure makes you want to continue. Being able to do even just 15 mins each day has enabled me to make great progress. Duolingo is a great tool for combining with other resources such as films, grammar books, listening to radio etc."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Where is the stupid music coming from and why in the heavens is there no button to turn it off, it has nothing to do in a language learning app, huge lettdown The app takes a huge load of the system power and tends to not g out for minutes at a time. Optimization would be usefull."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like Duolingo but I think it would be better if it had an online dictionary, and a verb conjugation reference section. Also, there are many occasions where it doesn't translate your answers into English after you've done an exercise, which may leave you wondering exactly what a phrase in Spanish meant."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have nothing but positive things to say about this app, it's literally free courses for just about any language you wish to learn. You essentially have a college course at your fingertips for free, to take at your own pace. Incredible app, it would be even better if you extended this to other topics."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I really enjoy using this app. It has helped me learn much more than I'd previously learned while being a soldier in Germany years ago and has also helped me to refresh what I did know already. I do wish one could continue on withou having to earn and used hearts and or gems and also the ads could use a bit more of them so they aren't so repetitive though. But then its free.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is a gift from GOD. I really enjoy the way Duolingo works, and how the company behind it is actually fun and plays with the community (check the duolingo channel). I'm currently learning arabic, my home language, since I forgot it, and Duolingo helped me a lot, even on the day of installation. Also for some reason I thought duolingo was a paid app, but its freemium (free but has a subscription)."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The issue is that, the app itself will show that lm done with 99% of quests and after that it shows completely different, this has happened twice üò≠ to me which is soo annoying also sometimes when l have completed a quest, it must consider for the badge too, here it's not happening to me. Now if l have finished a Unit it's not showing anything at all, it's still showing 0/1 which is too annoying, please Duolingo Tech Team Sort it out As Soon As Possible, it's becoming worse day by day."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Have used this app for a while (currently have a 188 day streak and have previously had long streaks) but just heard they have cut translators to primarily rely on AI translation. This is going to be inaccurate and will take away the value of using this app. Going to look for language practice elsewhere until duo decides they value quality translation.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoy the app and usually spend time each day in the mornings and evenings learning German. This style of learning works very well for me, and I spend more time as the lessons progress on review to ensure I don't forget. The only downside imo is that the app is WOKE. I would really like to spend the money on a pro subscription, but refuse to do so on those grounds. On the plus side, 15 to 30 minute sessions are effective for me, and I highly recommend from that perspective."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it's good. Sometimes the exercises are set up so that you make a mistake if you're in a hurry (e.g. words look the same at first glance) and you lose a heart for a silly mistake, but it's easy to get hearts for free."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is really a great application, but those who study super lessons and those who study normal lessons should be separated because when I study for three hours to increase my xp and reach the level,those who study super lessons can only quadruple their xp in 15 minutes. It's really bad for them to do it.I study 20 and someone who studies super lessons studies 2 lessons, they reach my xp.I also want to take a super class, but I can't because there are no facilities where I am, so please take care"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"best language learning app. This app is very helpful and it's very easy it's like a game it has strike and leaderboard and many lessons,levels,etc. This app has more than 40 languages to learn. this is best language learning app in my opinion. everyone must try it now"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I genuinely think this is a really good app. it's one of the reasons that I'm passing Spanish right now. the only thing is, I've tried learning other languages on duo but some just aren't as good as others. the Spanish course was really solid and I leaned a lot from it, but I also did the Chinese course and it didn't really teach me anything."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is probably the best language learning app I've ever seen. it has really cute illustrations and it's very clear in understanding. if you are willing to learn a new language I recommend you try Duolingo ü¶â
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The addition of hearts is such a hindrance when trying to learn, its such a cash grab to provoke you into getting the paid version. Also, the lessons themselves are not such that a beginner would feel comfortable with their learning. The only good thing with this newer version is that the lessons are divided into levels A1, A2 and so on. So it's easier to keep track of where you are."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"AMAZING I have been using Duolingo for a few years now it has helped my language skills so far I've learned Japanese and some Spanish. overall Duolingo is a great, FANTASTIC app for learning multiple languages other than the language you already know."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"amazing app. fun and educational! gaining hearts, listening ,getting treasure boxes in the game etc.. 5/5.i am currently learning French in this app. 7 ( seven million people are learning French in duolingo. if we get a mistake, we get to try and try again and again. very less ads and more educational and fun duolingo. MUST TRY. learning language in a fun way."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ads before and after every lesson, laying off workers and replacing them with AI, and then only keeping the minimum amount of workers needed just to review what the AI says. Overall, this app has deteriorated greatly since I last had it, so I'm switching to another language learning app that will actually help me connect with people that speak the language I want to learn; rather than having me talk to some soulless AI."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"its been really fun to finally have a grip on how other languages work and its been such a great idea, it breaks down communication barriers and keeps language learning easy but also enticing, especially in the era of AI language translation and tech and i dont have to do a course i learn at my own pace and i dont even have to pay for subscription but honestly i love the app so much im actually tempted to finally try the free two weeks totally recommend to anyone wanting to learn a language"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo cuts workers as it relies more on AI ü•≤. No es perfecto. But this is not great overall. I remember using Duolingo when they had those forums where people PEOPLE would work together to build a more coherent lesson and worked on accuracy. AI has its place. But to let go people and use those who you keep to touch up AI IS....sad. I'm on a long streak, too. The beauty of learning languages is to connect to more people......and that takes from that."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"best UI/ UX in an app on the entire playstore. Ads that are not disturbing, widgets that reminds you every time, friendly, joyful interface that makes everything great! No lags, no bugs, huge regards to the UI/UX teamü§©üí™"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I don't usually bother to rate apps, but so far (day 3) this is really good. The best part is it's actually fun. I really want to keep going back to learn more and keep up my streak of days in a row. I already spoke some Chinese, and Duolingo allowed me to test into the appropriate level, which worked well."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have learned more in 42 days of 30 minute practice sessions. then I did in 4 years of high school French. having a background has helped because a lot is coming back to me, but the lessons make it fun and engaging and the information sticks in my brain!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It is very fun and interesting it gives us free super mode if you perform very well in the last 25 days I have goten it 2 times for 3 days each time which is very nice it helps you gain your xp and awards duolingo determines you by providing motivational quotes during your lessons but the only problem or glitch is that in my profiles when I go to my awards section I have only 9 or 10 awards to collect but others have more to collect overall in my opinion it is a very good app to connect
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I miss the previous version of this app. The comment section was very informative but they have removed that feature. Also the random ads are pretty annoying. I know ads are important from a marketing perspective but nonetheless it's kinda bummer. Hope to see the former features someday ....... Just a suggestion üôÇüôÉüôÇ
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New update has completely changed my progress when learning Chinese and makes new lessons almost impossible to complete as it gives me new vocab, expecting me to know what it means as it is in previous lessons, however, due to the lessons changing I was not able to learn these new words. I have no idea where to begin with Chinese now. This is a real shame as I have purchased duolingo super for the year and it is incredibly disappointing. I am even considering uninstalling."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"DO NOT BUY SUPER. At the end of 2023, while they were pushing their Super plans for the new year they laid off a huge percentage of workers in favor of relying on AI instead of people who actually understand language. I just canceled my subscription and am trying to get a refund. I feel so cheated and betrayed. I've noticed the quality going down hill over the years but this is the last straw. I didn't like the new AI features to begin with and now I can't opt out."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like Duolingo, but I think many of the exercises are annoyingly repetitive. After 600 days, I should no longer be asked to translate 3, 12, Spain or t-shirt. I have translated ""Te inscribiste"" more than 50 times already. That needs to be rectified."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a really fun app. Been using it for a couple of years, mostly out of curiosity (and the memes). It really grows on you. Something else that really has kept me going is seeing my friends also join and try different language too. Creates a fun environment where we are proud of each other. Good job to Duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Really slow paced. I have been working on the same exact sentences for a month. Give me something new. Also, some of the things I get wrong aren't actually wrong. And the app fails to adequately teach the Russian cases and grammar so I just have to guess or learn everything myself."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,brilliant and such fun. excellently presented. very short sessions which means you can do several a day between tasks. l even do a session after each chore when l am doing housework. surprising how quickly you start to pick up the language. you hear native voices not an English person teaching you and so you speak the language with a good accent. Best language course l have ever done l would recommend it to anyone
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App doesn't offer languages available on the website. Duolingo doesn't seem to care or reply. The user interface seems to get worse and worse. There may be more language options but the experience gets worse each time. Icons have absolutely no explanation other than endless pop ups about forc8ng you to start streaks, notifications or some or other pop up message. If it's not a pop up it's endless advertisements. I spend longer closing pop ups than using the app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very repetitive, keeps asking the same questions over and over and over and over. Instead of gauging user learning. There are faster and more organized apps. If you are really going to invest time and money on a language app look elsewhere for faster learning experience. Don't ever pay"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Learning new words daily, it helps me understand written text very well and getting better at speaking and understanding the words when spoken. i like it a lot."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They recently laid off a large amount of their human staff in exchange for more machine learning. The translations and were already starting to feel less and less useful as they tried to promote it, but if they keep going with the AI machine learning translations instead of actual humans that speak the language the whole experience is just going to get worse and worse."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The App allows us to continue at own pace & thats the best thing according to me ü§ì You dont need to specifically learn the grammar. You learn it by simply learning sentence formation & talking. Well, I enjoy this part the most; duolingo helps you learn by sentence formation & even if you dont have a company of someone to talk to, the app requires you to say the phrases to the app. üòò So far I'm only 8 days in & already LOVE it. I'll definitely pay for the ""pro"" learning in 6 months or so. üòÖ"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is geared more towards kids, brilliant for school level grammar, I just wanted to learn conversational and I don't need all the pat on the back fan fare and leader boards that has a primary school age feel to it.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So far a few days in, really enjoying Duolingo... Very addictive and have started learning 3 different languages all at once. They start you on basic words and forming of sentences and gradually go up. The lessons are quick and fun. Good job to all involved in this app, I'm loving it..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'd started the German course in the past, literally years ago, and I've just restarted it again to prep for a move in a few years. I was amazed at how much I still remembered. A fun way to learn a new language!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I think the reminders have made the biggest postive impact on my progress in learning. The lessons are relatable and the animations have greatly improved from my introduction to the app. I am still looking for the music class.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"An invaluable tool for learning a language. I'm learning Spanish and I'm pleasantly surprised at how much I've learnt! It's entertaining structure (almost like playing a game) makes it so easier to adhere to. I spend at least 15 minutes a day & I've reached the gold league! 24 days into my course, I can see me learning Spanish indefinitely! quiero ser profesora de espa√±ol üòÄüòÉ √âs muy divertido!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Easy to use and reasonably entertaining. Sometimes, the combination of gamification and prompting to use the app annoys me. I stick with it, though, because I do appreciate the opportunity to learn and practice from anywhere."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Amazing program, and it's free! I highly recommend it! However, I dislike including the typing exercises in timed lessons because I'm penalized for being a slow texter. I don't want to spend hard earned gems to finish lessons. üòÆ‚Äçüí®"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app. Ads aren't too intrusive, plenty of offerings, great material for practicing. Does not support all languages equally; e.g. French and Japanese have strong support but Arabic and Ukranian not as much. Particularly with Arabic, the text learning lessons overlap a lot with the learning track and there is not a lot of voice actor variety. Very satisfied nonetheless."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Solid app with a great pace. However the voice features are lacking some. I've been taking lessons for about 3 weeks now and any time there is something where I have to speak it marks it as incorrect even though it's correct. If this could be fixed I'd rate it 5 stars
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I like the app but it keeps locking up my phone when I try to use ""rapid review."" I have to restart the app every time and lose my review progress. I purchased the one year subscription on 1/27/24 (4 days!!) before this problem cropped up. I want my money back."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app itself is very good, and it makes learning a new language fun. I just have a problem with the whole switching your lesson plan as soon as you're getting into it part of it. They use you as a test dummy without even asking permission, and it's hurting my progression."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"AI is no substitute for actual, trained translators. Keeping only some translators to check that the AI is ""good enough"" and not even checking for them being ACCURATE is extremely unacceptable. You were fun while you lasted, Duolingo, but capitalism has destroyed you, and I'll never be able to trust that I'm actually learning another language from you again."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"pretty convenient tool to casually study a new language. I think I would need more tools to become fluent, but I've been enjoying it so far and feel I'm learning slowly. my main complaint would be that there's no dictionary for words you've learned. I've wanted to go over just the words at times but I have yet to find a way to do so through the app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm learning German and honestly this app is really helping,it's also helping getting rid of my anxiety of talking so I love that and it's just making me happy because I feel like not every day I do good so like just having an app that you can learn something and make it feel like you're doing a good job is really good for me it's like when you look up a word on Google that shows you it and it shows you how to say it and then it tells you to say it and then they'll tell you what's wrong & right."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really like their teaching style, however with literally every update they change the course, so ""to keep up with the new course"" they constantly pull me back. Very annoying, I feel like I haven't made any progress in the past 0,5 year."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I used duolingo every single day for over a year to learn Russian. It definatley helped with learning the alphabet in the first month or two. Past that I only learned a handful of usable phrases, most of which i taught myself. I learned more usable language watching foreign netflix with subtitles on and google translate than using this app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"overall great tool especially if you play for free. if you want to learn (or remember from school üòú) a language it gets the job done. monthly subscription to really get ahead isn't bad. couple minor scope keeping bugs that are easy to resolve by restarting, but generally a great app"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is totally amazing...you are not only reading, but listening, and speaking. You get points for completing units and lessons. The best part is with the more points you move up in ranks and obtain medals. When you add friends to follow you get to cheer and celebrate their accomplishments."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's easy to learn. But if you try fee many ads are disturb you. I suggest for Duolingo , it's more better if possible to choice learning partners and communicate each other. Thanks."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love the Duolingo app! It's been an essential tool in my language learning journey. The variety of languages offered is impressive, and the lessons are engaging and effective. The gamified approach keeps me motivated, and the progress tracking feature helps me stay on course. Plus, the community aspect adds an extra layer of encouragement. Whether I'm learning Spanish, French, or any other language, Duolingo makes it fun and accessible."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Got locked out of my paid subscription for several weeks, it loses my progress and courses and user names and tells me verification codes are incorrect. When it works it's a great app. When it doesn't and you've paid 89.99 annually it's not very impressive. Responses are very slow except x it seems ."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It is the best language i have seen upto now. everything is perfect the issue is if i got doubts in language how can i ask there is no option to ask any doubts. And another problem is u are giving tips that is pretty good thing but u have give much more explanation about language and u also have to give the explanation of particular language culture .It is very useful when we go that particular country. Lost progress XP when updated. Very bad duo team. I want my X back. I'll decrease the rating
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Updating the review from 5 star to 1 star So on 5th March 2024, I opened my App, saw a message that Chinese course has been updated and my progress has been synced, now when I review any exercise or proceed further looks like everything has changed and not a single word that appears familiar to me, it looks like I have to restart and my progress of 40 days just gone in vien. Dear team even if you want to update course do it properly or intimate before hand, want the old Chinese course back....."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have been using the paid version Duolingo for several years to learn Hebrew, and it's really great for getting to a certain point in your foreign language learning. However, the sentences are not really very useful in everyday life in a foreign country. There should be a unit on medical terms and units on banking terms and shopping terms. Constant review on words about knights, princesses, and fairy tales are totally useless. Duo, up your game and make this a real language learning tool."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've only been using this app for 2 weeks, a lot of folks I read reviews for talk about how it used to be. I'm not sure how it was before but I think it's good now. You definetly need to pay attention for patterns though. It teaches primarily through trial and error, not by explanation. The internet is a great tool (try chat gpt) when you have further questions. So far all the information I've seen has been correct to my knowledge including when I have thought it's wrong and went to look it up."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I can't imagine how they've managed to put this learning portal together soamazingly well. it's stimulating and fun, with a perfect balance of competition, praise and rewards. The interactive cartoon characters are great too. I put off learning Spanish for years but now I'm totally hooked! üòÄüëç"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've never tried learning another language before 2024 and Duolingo is my first go into learning one. The ads can be annoying sometimes, but all in all it seems good. The lessons are fun and easy as a beginner so far. I'm only 12 days into learning as of the time of writing."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The old update was much better than new one. I didn't expect that you'll remove unlimited hearts and keep ads in between. So irritating. Remove the ads and keep unlimited hearts or I'll uninstall it. I hate this app now ü§¢üò°.It's all because of your premium version. Free users don't get much benefits to learn a language while premium users get. Why don't you give the app free to the users where all are equal and no one is a vip member?
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"At first, i didn't think duolingo would teach me. I have tried multiple language apps. but I think duolingo is the best one. With super duolingo, I learn much easier because there is no ads and i can practice. On top of that, I have unlimited hearts! Now, When I go to school and have spanish class, I would've already learned it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I hate how the app has a leaderboard, like, ""Oh hey, you're better than this person!"" Or you just fell out of the top 15!"" It's just judging you, and it doesn't help you learn a language. It just makes you feel bad, and it just gives you some phrases to memorize. Plus, for the 'better' version, it's so expensive. I feel like I'm not even getting help, I'm just getting judged."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app made me learn new words, and the language I am interested to learn in to. Well it has its disadvantages, like keeping your streak is a must, or some words that aren't translated as real words. But it is an addicting and a fun way to learn new languages. Great app, I love it very much!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"i've been following this app since 2020 and i've had a pretty great experience with this language learning app but it all went wrong when this year it started showing advertisements and asking for buying a plan.I really felt that it was the one and only best platform that provides free language learning courses but ever since this app started showing adds and to buy a plan, i've felt that it really took people's interest and the app's interface has become worse,it used to be good back then."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have really bad experience using this app! I do an english test from Duolingo and i believe 100% im not cheating, im not opening another app, etc but the result still invalid!! They have a really bad syatem and i dont know why this used as an English Test. I pay twice for this. Im not recommend this app. The support also not helping me. They ignore the feedback from customer. Bad!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have been using duolingo since 2020 but there is a bug that isn't being fixed! Sometimes i reach a question and i am not allowed to drag and drop the words. I am completely blocked, i have no other choice but to drop the exercise and repeat it all over again. I use Samsung A33"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"good with building habits, but so many weird translations that push the user to make mistakes, and too much repetition on the non-essential, never-will-be-used-in-real-life, random sentences. that's what made me question if this is worth my time."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have a reasonable knowledge of Zulu but wanted to perfect it. For the past 50 odd days I have been doing the same thing over and over. And over. I am at the point of giving up! I would love to learn more every day Zulu like phrases : How are you doing? Talking about the weather, your family. Please give me advise on the spelling of the words. And basic grammar rules. I would like more vocabulary as well."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Because of the benefits of Super Duolingo, it makes the leaderboard more of a ""play-to-win"" leaving people who can't afford to pay for it more difficulty getting to the top. This makes people not want to participate leaving to less learning. Ultimately, the whole Duolingo super really puts people who can't afford it down."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I recommend this app because its really simple to use and they teach whatever language u want in simple terms. It is really easy to understand but gets harder but that is just part of learning in other languages. I like the quiz a lot and it does do some revisions on previous lessons. This app is designed like a game and it is really fun it may be a little stressful if u dont pay attention. Overall i like this app i really recommend this app Thanks Duolingo!!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is such a great app, maybe there should be an option to choose 1-3 languages but you can still choose a language you want. Duolingo is recommended from me and many others. Follow duolingo on tiktok and download the app!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I was already unhappy with the reliance on teaching by rote rather than teaching how the language works (for example, duolingo never even provides so much as a verb conjugation chart), but since discovering that translators were fired in lieu of ""AI"" (which is a misnomer‚Äî""AI"" is just reinforced bias of the programmer), I can no longer use or support duolingo, no matter how much i support free learning worldwide. If i wanted a free, bad translation by a machine, i'd have used google translate."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,this a very good app I am very happy to use it and many languages you learn in this aap and you also share with your friends this aap . I use this app around 4 months and this aap my favourite I don't know how to speak English properly but I can try to explain my thoughts about this app . this aap fell me better when I thought English was very deficult and complicated but this aap it makes very easy and simple.I think you must try to improve your English and other language you want to speak ...
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"the app is nice it helps me learn new languages in fun and consistent manner so that I dont get board or stop and never come back to my lessons it also notifies me when I forget, I reccomend this app to any user trying to learn a new language as it helps very well, also the ads are not bad nor annoying they only pop up some times and they are short. this is a great app keep up the good work and I hope to see more languages added to this app in the future."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The constant addition of updates has made Duolingo more and more buggy. Daily I have to close and reopen the app because it stops working in one way or another. Before adding unnecessary features that break Duolingo, Duolingo should focus on having an app that consistently works and isn't full of bugs."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It purposefully wrongs my correct answers. As a result, I lose a lot of my gems! It's infuriating at times when I can't move on to the next level because this app is making my correct answers wrong every single time!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I am truly enjoying this app with all it entails and it's free. I love its basic simplicity and the reminders it has that help me stay on track! Everyday I get better and better. I recommend it :)
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I hate the new update, you guys have done, all of my previous progress that i have really worked hard for is all gone and the app has taken me to a completely new level, some of the words in the new level ,I have no idea what are they so, than I will have to start the unit all over again"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very poor at country specific vocabulary. Please note: we only use the term ""Ma'am"" when addressing a Queen; ""check"" is American English, not British; it's spelled ""grey"" here. Zero response to problems raised, so no, not impressed. The voice recognition varies from good to truly appalling. Free, yes. Quality, no. Edit: they are now conning us into watching ads and not giving the rewards promised. I've watched 6 ads, no reward given. Seriously unimpressed now."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The way the lessons are structured makes it difficult for beginners to learn the language (Chinese). I highly suggest everyone who wants to learn Mandarin to try HelloChinese first. They have actual videos of Native Chinese speaking and a better explanation of the use of each words. EDIT: There are lots of errors and wrong answers in Duolingo like gender differentiating pronouns like ""he"", ""she"", and ""it"" all have the same sound, tƒÅ, but different written characters. Duolingo doesn't know that"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is an amazing app, it makes languages easy and fun with the animations, and it really does not let you break your learnimg streak with the reminders üòÖ the only downside for me is that it doesn't have igbo, hausa or yoruba if it did it would be perfect ( it might also get repetitive but that is just to make you remember)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I honestly quite like Duolingo as a daily supplement when you can't invest an hour or more to rigorous study a day. But it isn't perfect, such as sentences being wrong or grossly simplified in some courses such as Japanese, which I'm studying. This is why human curators are so important and why I can't recommend DL as they strip their workforce in favor of more AI automation. This will only exasperate these issues rather than improving them. AI has it place, but not without human oversight."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app would get a full 5 if of these things were corrected, or added. Slightly glitchy in the not loading area. No dictionary of words learned, which would be a great section to review. And a translator, because I'm running to Google to learn individual words I have not come across on the app yet. Otherwise, fun and good app"

I'm honestly shocked that this is free, I'm so glad it is, so yep! that's all I gotta say, BTW please don't haunt my family if u skip a day ü•≤"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've only been using the app for a few days now so I can't say how well it works for knowledge retention but so far I do feel like I'm learning a lot and it's actually fun on top of that. Not that I need to convince anyone, the Duolingo marketing team is well on top of that, it's actually the only reason I downloaded the app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good for new language learners. My dad speaks Russian, and he got duolingo to practice and refine his skills.

One time to save it I had to do a lesson at midnight, like 11:55 but it did not count my lesson and lots of glitches and i had to do the lesson again but i ran out of time and my streak became 0. In terms of making language learning a game, its good. But the content is repeating again and again and lots of glitches."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,very nice app it also gave me 3 days premium as a reward. It needs a little bit of polish like their are some words that are pronounced by the app a bit wrong or I would say a bit too in depth. Lastly the hearts system and the ads. The hearts were not a problem but ads after every part of exercise was a bit over. But they are not that much to make it for Star as I got free premium membership for three days as a reward for my excellent work and the time I have given.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app is good but I hate the fact that they don't let you reconfirm when you press on something to buy. I have lost so many diamonds because I accidentally clicked on something and it didn't ask me to confirm. please add a feature like that.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,this really helped me learning new languages... it has some accent problem like it actually tells you the proper and formal education of any language which can be a little problamatic because if you travel another countries the language would be casual or friendly but if you say it in a too much formal and professional way it seems kinda weird..... the problem is so cute though üòÅ

"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Not great for dyslexic users who want to learn how to speak but not wright the language they are learning. You can turn off the listning and speaking exercises but not the wrighting exercises. So it just becomes very frustrating. I think if this were to change it would be much better.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have enjoyed each time I spent on Duolingo. And I am still enjoying my time on it. French is a language I am striving to add to my international languages. Duolingo has been helping me to achieve that. I can now speak simply in French. I can go shopping, and ask for directions already in the language. I was not active on Duolingo for months and when I came back, the exercise I was made to solve brought back all the memories of all the words I had learned in the past. Thanks"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"pretty good, I have been using it for not even a week and knowing some easy words like girl and woman. it does get hard to use it outside of it. do to my patterns and stuff like that. plus, if you have a hard time remembering things, it's ok bc there is always a way to earn more hearts. you can help yourself. Great for my ADD, as it's fun and interesting. even if i didn't want to learn what i did, it would just be fun to play."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've tried other apps and keep coming back to Duolingo. It's a solid program that gives you a good basis for learning a language. I do recommend finding a conversational app once you're ready for it, and I recommend buying the premium subscription as it is well worth it in my opinion."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best help and supportive app ever for learning a language (or even more than 1) I'm currently learning Welsh and French for aiding my language subjects at GCSE, honestly it's giving me such a helping hand! Only a few ads here and there, not really annoying and super fast without any glitches or laginess almost ever!! Love Duolingo ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The learning for certain languages is much better and more engaging than others. I wanted to learn Indonesian but it's hard and not engaging, it's very basic. Whereas learning for French is much more engaging.. there speaking, matching, and much more that could be put on other languages."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"the lessons are slow but deliberate. you learn the sound of the consonants and the vowels in before starting off with small sentences. this is great because they use similar-sounding words in order for you to get the hang of sentence structures, but it doesn't mean you get the essential sentences one normally needs to survive. for example, I'm learning Korean and so far I know how to say this baby's milk, and the students key, but not I'm hungry and where's the bathroom"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I wish I could disable more animations and post-lesson screens after a lesson is done. Wish I could disable streak freezes. If I do not do a lesson one day, I want streak to be broken and want to be able to start a new streak the very next day. Due to various streak freeze gifts, I need to wait several days so all freezes could expire before starting a new streak again."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I am giving only 2 stars because this app don't have urdu language. There are so many people in Pakistan and India who read and speak urdu but unfortunately it is not given as a language for learning English. Those who don't know Hindi can't use this app to learn English because this app only supports learning English through Hindi and other languages.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Really enjoyable applications which I have used in conjunction with other apps, TV and books for many years. I enjoy the premium version and it keeps me motivated with fun lessons to keep my language learning experience fun and continuous. Really recommend if you are in it for the long haul."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is good,buh I've been having issues with the speaking practices. I can't speak in any practice and I have Duolingo plan but it's still not working,I've also tried everything but I still can't speak in any exercises. I think this needs to be fixed immediately."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is an app that I'd definitely recommend to friends. I've been able to juggle learning 4 separate languages without forgetting much. The repetition of words, phrases, and even just single characters helps stuff stick in your mind. Overall, 10/10"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"You'll never become fluent in a language with this app, and you'll need other learning tools to help you. The material in languages other than Spanish/French is also much more sparse, and even the order in which you learn things is weird. Why am I learning the Italian word for ""shark"" before learning how to count to 5? Why am I expected to know the correct usage of indefinite and definite articles I've never been taught? Also, there's no way to contact any Support team for the app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,brilliant! I wish they could add Afrikaans and Xhosa on this app. Those are languages we have to learn in South Africa. Our kids would benefit hugely from this type of learning. I'm loving learning French!! This app is amazing üëè
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Still a decent app for learning languages, but not being able to edit your profile picture is really dumb. It's not a make or break, but I had a lot of fun with changing my picture daily. Honestly it really bums me out and I'm now going to try other language learning apps."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is fun to use and keeps me coming back daily so I don't fall out of the habit of practicing. They also keep updating the activities to keep it engaging. It's also worth supporting them to help support their awesome podcast series, but it's still great even as a free service. Do note that you shouldn't only use one source to learn, but Duolingo helps make sure you get at least some kind of practice in every day"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love this app!! I love learing new languages. But I would like to see other languages that people don't really talk about as I want to improve my own language so I would like duolingo to add yoruba. But overall great app.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's ok. As soon I purchased for a year which was a gift. Then the voice recorder can't hear me. I speak clearly & wrong! Everything started getting twitchy. The bots on the game are ridiculous. How you get 20,000 ex with no superduo in a day or 2. Too many bots and cheaters in this app. Trying to get the diamond league will be virtually impossible because again first place has 30,000 ex. The game is rigged. If it doesn't get better I'll cancel my subscription and go with Rosetta stone."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,fun way to learn a new language. i feel like i am retaining a good deal. only complaint is that sometimes the audio isn't correct. certain letters will occasionally be mixed like a g becoming an m. i bought super as soon as i started so i am not sure how people using the free game with ads and limited lives handle.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really want to give it five stars, but this app needs a grammar section, we should be able to understand why we got something wrong and how to say things correctly instead of just getting green or red. Also there should be a way to deactivate streaks and leaderboards if we want, these features may be useful for a lot of people to keep them engaged, but for some people it's just annoying. I don't care about any of this, I just wanna do my lessons in peace..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Fantastic app, do wish they would add British pronunciations for example syllables, you have to say it with an American accent for it to make sense, for example: ""Ha"" like in ""HOt"" makes no sense with an English accent. Apart from that, a great learning habit!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like that there are a variety of ways to learn: reading, listening, and translating both to and from your target language. When selecting the answer from a list, I think it could be a little more difficult, or less obvious which will be the correct option."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"great for get started in any language. very good for listening, reading and writing. it needs to enhance the speaking tasks & it needs also to improve motivational exercises, for example the person that win the leader board five times will win a videocall with a counterpart of the language you are studying."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Frequent repetition of the same sentence is good for the beginner level. In the upper levels that is bothering and annoying. Have more native speakers chose sentences, and more useful sentences for travelers: ordering food, a hotel room, around the airport. (Reviewed and kept the original)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It wouldnt let me learn hiragana, i dont want to lose my streak. It would say ""an error occurred, try again later"". It pisses me off. And if i want to skip, it wouldnt let me either... So pleaseeeee fix this bug"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"duolinguo is a good idea, but the ads after every completed lesson are a pain. I understand duolinguo has to make money somehow, but this is too much. I stopped learning after a while because of that. and I am considering again now... Ads after 2 or 3 lessons would more acceptable."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Will not let us submit a bug report online. Added members to a family plan but it's still in the free version for them. Great learning support for Spanish and French, less so for other languages."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Every time you get used to the UI, every time there's a learning tool that's even slightly helpful, you can always expect there to be an update that makes it all just a little bit worse, a little less convenient. The ability to practice writing Kanji was incredibly helpful for memorization, so of course that had to go. The ability to click a button and go over past mistakes was great, so why change it? The constant updates are incessantly aggravating and incomprehensible."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Edit Jan 2024: the future of thr app is grim now that they fired most of their translators to use AI. If you want that level just use google translate instead and skip this app, at least then everyone will know why you sound like a non native speaker. Works well for repetition, but having the grammer rules only accessible on the desktop website is a huge negative."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have enjoyed Duolingo for a few years now and would recommend people upgrading to the ""super"" as it benefits you so much. The only negative I have, which could possibly be a big, is that whenever I get the reminder notification on my phone, when I click it, it tries to load and then freezes. I have to then force stop on the app, close it and then reopen it. Hopefully this can be fixed"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duo has recently reduced and almost eliminated keyboard input for most exercises in favor of 'pick the word bubbles in the right order' ones, which makes it so you don't really need to learn the language. Overall it's fine, they've added some good features but getting rid of community discussions was a major disappointment. However, after the recent news that Duo laid off most of their human translators in favor of AI I've finally decided to uninstall and go with a different program."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was a little frustrated at first because I was losing lifes from having some small problems with the speaking exercises. I don't think it's from my pronunciation because now, if I repeat the word over and over again, even though every time I pronounce it the same, at some point it will accept the word spoken so I can pass the exam, so all good now :D It's a lovely app to work with. It is easy to navigate, it has great feedback and XP boost to motivate ppl to learn more. I totally recommend it!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"When I initially installed the app I found it to be a fun and effective way to get into learning (Japanese in my case). I was having solid progress, if slow because I was taking my time, but at some point the lessons changed in form and quality and seemed to become worse. Recently I see they're dropping their actual translators in favor of AI translations, which for a language learning app is just a mistake. Hopefully they fix this but in the mean time I cannot recommend it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I can see why people like this app. It is playful, has a nice design, and works a lot with rewards. There are some things I think are worth improving. A grammar summary in the guidebook would be good instead of only having only key phrases. For me, it also has too much of a game character sometimes as I have the feeling it's a lot about getting badges, rewards, and XP. A setting with less of a game character would be nice. Let's see in some months how much it helps me to learn a language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app makes it enjoyable to learn a new language. I like that I can follow my friends that also use the app, as well congratulate them in my feed when they reach a certain achievement. The daily quests motivate me to learn. The lessons are fair- not too difficult or too easy. The achievement badges are a fun touch. I just wish that there were more / extra badges after completing them. Also, the match madness in the sections are unreasonable. I need more than 1:45 to reach 120 matches. :("
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I am finally in the financial situation where i would want to go pro. But given that the new layout is still not as addictive as the old one I am barely keeping the streak alive. Additionally, after each lesson there are a handful of sloooowly skippable rewards (speed, accuracy, daily quests etc.) which are annoying and would inevitably still be part of the experience with pro. They used to be skippable much quicker."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a great app for learning a new language, every feature is basically available for free mostly. It is easy to follow and to progress. Although, there used to be stories that you can listen to and then check your understanding, I loved those the most but now they have disappeared and even if I click in my collection on stories, none show up, at least for korean. So if this is a glitch, which I hope it is, I would like to ask Duolingo team to clear it please. Thank you!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It used to be really nice! Im a bit neurodivergent and never really learned the way other people did and I loved this app because you could do things your own way. Eventually they did a bunch of tests and found out what works for ""most people"" and updated the app to force you to study things in a certain order that makes it really hard to practice what you need. They removed the little help section explaining the grammar in each specific lession and replaced it with a giant unusable textbook."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really really enjoyed this app a while ago. I understand changes to make updates to make learning easier but there are glitches where I don't get my xp or my quests aren't logged. It seems like ways Duolingo is cheating people out of doing a few lessons a day. No one should feel guilty for taking a break from learning. It almost feels like the developers are making people addicted to chasing quests, points and trophies only to have the whole system change before they can finish. Frustrating."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really like the lessons, practice sessions and stories, easy to follow. However, the premium trial is a bit misleading. it stated there would be a reminder to cancel/carry on, but sadly this didn't arrive. I was charged for the full year subscription, and there was no way of cancelling it, just going between Duolingo, Google and PayPal. I'm carrying on because I'm not wasting my money after paying almost ¬£70 which I couldn't afford."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I currently have a 575 day strike ‚Äî and I'm actively looking for alternatives. The app used to be really nice, and I really tried to like the (forced!) update, but I have to admit I can't. It's not the interface I'm having a problem with, but rather the dumbing down of exercises. There are less written tasks, more mindless tapping, and I don't feel like I'm learning anything anymore, it's way too simple. And the comments are gone - they had a lot of useful explanations!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, but it has its downsides. I do not really like how when you do a lesson, it can sometimes give you words that you have not reviewed in a long time but lets you figure it out by tapping it luckily. Overall this is a great app. Streak freezes are so handy when you have a tight packed schedule, short lessons, and is so easy to use. I can't figure out how to change my profile pic back into a custom one and does not show on leaderboard but still a incredible app!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Not only is Duolingo responsible for mass firings and replacing people with generative voices and text, but the replacement is so bad that some of the languages aren't even right anymore. Irish Gaelic - the language I was learning for over a year - is now not safe to use on Duo anymore. The fake voices and bad text are grammatically off, and some of the sounds they make aren't even made in the Irish language. They're teaching people a version of Irish that isn't real! Moving away from Duo now."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I am learning Japanese and there has only been one speaking exercise while been studying (3 years plus) I've had the free and paid for versions. The free version is heavy on the ads. The price isn't too expensive but other than going ad free I don't really use the additional features. I don't like you have to have 'friends' for quests. Years ago it was easier to select the words from the bank and drag them around. Now if you want to make a change, you have to return the words to word bank."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really like this app. It's been fun learning Spanish. I signed up for the free trial of Super Duolingo, and when the trial period was over, I expected to be charged the monthly rate. Instead they charged me the FULL YEAR! I wasn't prepared financially for it, so I attempted to get a refund. I got the runaround, thry said that it was handled by Google Play, but the transaction isn't in my purchase list. I've sent an email to Duolingo with no response. I'll increase my rating if they respond."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm learning new words, but I don't feel like Duolingo is good at teaching conjugation and tenses of verbs. Also, the use of articles, prepositions, and other small words seems either inconsistent or not very well explained. Some exercises explaining how and why things are done would be more helpful, as opposed to just memorization."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo has been a great experience for me, as a teen and student, aside from it's few imperfections. It makes sure I keep a steady a pace in my language learning journey with reminders for it's interactive lessons. Although the ads are a bit annoying, there aren't many of them. There is a variety of languages to choose from, which I am thankful for, but some small languages are not available. Overall, this app is good for ANYONE to learn with a passion and patience. Practice makes perfect! üíö"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Submitted at least 5 help requests for the same issue and cannot manage to get a reply from support. After almost 2 years using duolingo (paid version!!) this might be the nail in the coffin for me. They're also constantly ""updating"" the courses but all it serves to do is confuse people and interrupt progress. Very little advancement in lesson material or learning tools, they just tweak little things to make people more inclined to want to keep their ""streak"""
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Educative and fun... Great pace for easy understanding and mastering... doesn't bombard you and doesn't slow you down. They bring back the things you've learnt a while ago so ensure you do not forget those while learning new words. You get to listen to how the words are pronounced and used in sentences. And yeah, a new feature allows you practice and answer questions via your speech. Great, user friendly interface too. I'll highly recommend."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, it is the best learning app i've ever come across, i've never regretted making this decision, it's been one year with duo, learning languages can't get more easier and fun, the most interesting part is that no charges applied just have your data and you're good to go, it is competitive, addictive, fun and many more, they even remind you via email to study, duo also encourages all your stages of progress, i can't think of anything more easier and comfortable, Best App Ever ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The learning method is well placed that it is easier for a non-Nihingo speaker to follow and execute. The animation and the sound work in such a way that contribute to the level of focus the learner has to give. It is never boring and the swtiching between English and Nihongo in terms of translation flows remarkably smooth.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The pace of the app is great. I wish there was the ability to pre download lessons. We spend a lot of time on an airplane and can only do one lesson before it needs an internet connection again. The choice of words it starts with can be interesting. Too many LONG ads for non-Super people. The subscription is too expensive as well, if it was half the sale cost I would be in but it would be my most expensive subscription of any all I have if I were to join Super."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is functionally very sound. I have not experienced any issues. I am no expert on didactics, but I feel like I'm learning a language properly and at a steady pace. The milestones are satisfying and help me return daily. I have tried this app with and without Super Duolingo. I think the pricing is realistic, given the extra options (mistake list rehearsal, more lives, free legendary tests). More importantly, the free version is very usable: the ads appear predictably and aren't obnoxious."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm fond of Duolingo as a temporary language learning refresher, but for me it's not for long-term language learning. The user interface is pleasant and the competitive aspect keeps me engaged. My main issue is that there's not much explanation as to how the language works (i.e. sentence structure or verb conjugation), there's very rarely an explanation of WHY an answer is wrong or right, just what the right answer is. It's to keep people on the app for longer, but classes were better."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been doing duo for 12 months now and whilst there isn't any pronunciation check offered (either a limitation of the product/language) I do feel that I can understand a lot of vocabulary. it's not a 100% passive thing, you have to repeat back the sentences in the language out loud to get the rhythm and word order to become second nature, and I cover the bottom of my phone and make sure I can translate the meaning of the sentence given before I view the word options, but it's a great starter!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have been learning Korean for about 3 years now, and I was hoping to boost my level by starting on a language app. Unfortunately, this app seems to cater most to beginners, and I have found it way too easy and am unable to skip levels as I need. Additionally, the sentences aren't very useful, and the beginnings of words often get cut off. For example, if the word is ""Í∞ÄÏßÄÎã§,"" I can only hear the ""~Ïù¥Îã§"" sound at the end of the word when I press on the button to hear it. Pronunciation also lacking."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Ok I'm a linguist and I think that Duolingo's teaching methods are not super effective for learning a language. It relies too heavily on direct translation, even though they've developed exercises to learn through context, which is a faster and more effective learning style after your first module in a foreign language. It's also mad annoying in more ways than I can count. The good part about Duolingo is that it's addicting. It's better than phone games or social media. Good lang supplement."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good way to practice a little every day. I like that each word is individually translatable so you can learn vocabulary. I also like the different levels of challenges in ways have to answer, like filling in the blank versus typing an answer. I wish the lessons were a little more aggressive in advancing because sometimes it feels like you repeat the same lesson unnecessarily and that can get boring over a week."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,best practical and fun way to learn a new language in bite size segments. it also doesn't hold your hand but rather force your brain to learn and adapt. Update: it was great for the first week and stopped afterwards. It added very very few words (almost all of the vocabulary was animals names) and the style of learning was very unnecessarily repetitive and added almost nothing new after the first week
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Updated: 12/23 - I've been a paid member for a while. Unfortunately it's starting to get boring. The changes are constant. They forece you to do challenges with your friends. I feel sorry for the friends I have because I literally log on just to complete one exercise so I don't lose my streak. Other than that, considering removing my membership. ____ I really like the app, but it keeps repeating the same lessons. I've also lost the functionality to practice writing hangul."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm giving two star right now. Any other time, and I'd have given ten stars, 'cause it's a good app. Well not until last month when things got worse than before. It keeps saying ""an error occured "", when I try to open lessons. I don't know what's wrong. And I've got a good internet connection, yet. I've dropped down two leagues in a row, lost a lotta streaks, da*n! I've uninstalled and installed it back, still doing the same thing.. I don't normally do reviews, but I've been concerned and m‚àÜdüò¨"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a great tool to learn a language but could be better. Sometimes, the microphone feature doesn't understand you, and you lose a heart for that, which isn't fair. We also used to have to review a lesson or it would ""break,"" and it was helpful to refresh your memory. Now, you have to use your points to review. Also, the little people are bigger than the words, which splits them up in a sentence sometimes. They should make them smaller."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've used Duolingo for 5 years & I pay for the yearly sub. It's gotten better lately, but it's also added a ""pay for play"" option that's really really annoying. There are exercises that you cannot possibly complete within the allotted time-- oh, but if you buy these ""timer boosts"" you'll get more time!! You *can* earn some credits through doing quests but it's like any other pay for play game- not nearly what you need. It's really disappointing to see this in a learning app, esp one I pay for."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have been using it to learn Korean for the last five months. Decent for learning vocabulary, but it teaches you zero grammar and you have to figure that out by yourself. You will never achieve fluency using this app alone. Also, it is good for keeping your skills fresh and staying motivated. Also, the parts where it listens to you speak are often broken (e.g. it cuts you off before you even finish speaking)."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Fallen from grace, they tried to offer plans to people to keep learning free, they told us that they didn't want to use ads to keep their free learning running. I returned believing that this would still be the case, but they changed the layout, added fancy animations, added silly new things that make this feel like a kids game, and now ads are rampant. The format was great before. Why change it? The ads wouldn't be as bad if it didn't feel like a slog. I'd rather purchase a class in real life."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"New updates for the Spanish is awful compared to the old Duo. - Won't allow you to learn on the old version anymore. - Some of the speed challenges have a pop up immediately after time runs out hoping you'll click on the BS time extenders and waste gems - Doesn't have as many stories - More difficult to focus on a specific category (Traveling, Grocery, Restaurants, etc) Ultimately I got rid of paying for Duo Plus because of these reasons. Might purchase again if they allow the old version."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app everyday for 2 years. When I started it was working incredibly, few months ago it got a big update. Since then it's awful. Extremely laggy, sometimes so much that I need to close the app. I also noticed problem of app reversing my progress, it happened few times already. I finished my 2 section and started my 3 and it just reversed me to like the half of 2 section. It's annoying, but the app is good when you're learning language to just use it as a home exercise."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The ads are SUPER freaking loud!! I had a 3 day trial of the premium version of the app and no ads was very nice. I *would* pay for premium if it was a single payment (like a lifetime price) rather than a continued subscription model. Im on a fixed income which means I cant just shell out $ constantly for a subscription like this. Offer a one time payment flat fee and I'd definitely save up to buy it. Otherwise I guess I'll just keep going deaf because of ads that are unnecessarily LOUD.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I recommend this app for all those wanting to learn an unfamiliar language as it has a very good beginner course that teaches you the basics in a very digestible way. The app however loses a star due to a bit of a bug where despite you clearly speaking the words the apps microphone does not pick you up and can be very annoying. The app also lacks the language I was hoping to study, Afrikaans, thus I have been doing the Dutch course. If they do add Afrikaans though my rating would change to 5."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app has been very good. Thanks to the app, I can understand basic Spanish and I have an 87 day streak which I intend to make 88 tonight, but I don't know why the courses aren't ending. It keeps on loading for an extensive period of time, then I have to close the app and open it again. Although this ends the course, it doesn't increase my streak. I've tried clearing cache, app data and even uninstalling and reinstalling the app, all to no avail. I can't even log in anymore. Duo, pls fix dis."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Had good potential but every time they update it it feels less productive. On the last major overhaul the lesson plans switched things around and it told me I had completed a bunch of levels full of words and phrases I hadn't learned yet. So I pretty much had to start over from lesson one for anything to make sense. Updates since haven't been so drastic or detrimental to my learning, but they're clearly more focused on bloating the app with ""cute""animations rather than improving teaching."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm doing German. The language is generally correct but when sentence structure is flexible, Duolingo marks my version as incorrect. Some concepts do not exist in the real world, so not what any native speaker would say. The format and graphics are engaging, & the streak system encourages one to do at least one exercise every day. The base language is american English so is often incorrect and intensely irritating. Good enough app but you'd need to learn grammar & verb conjurgation separately."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I started using Duolingo to learn French about 6 months ago, and I really like it! I love how repetitive it is, and they give lots of examples on how to use new words, and where to put them in a sentence. Using other paid apps, I wasn't retaining information as well. I didn't give this 5 stars only because I do have to look up my questions sometimes, and the practice tests are 95% of the time things I learned in the very beginning. If I have to hear ""Tu manges une pizza"" one more time...."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The program cheats me during point scoring to move up the various levels. The program promises to give me 2X points on various occasions, but never actually does. I've complained about this problem for several weeks but it has yet to be resolved. Very disappointing. UPDATE: It's been months later and no one has resolved the bugs in the program. Awful tech support. I'm dropping the app score to one star and that's being generous."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's great but.. It's a good app to practice if you don't mind repeating the same sentences over and over too many times. The 'but' if for the fact that it promises you certain amount of xp when u start the session and you don't get it even if you did 100%. I start says 20/30/40 and even 60xp, and even with 100% get 15/20/and 30.. Even with the double xp at times it doesn't even reach the 40 as it says before you start the lesson. It's quite annoying tbh.."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,At the start it felt like it was trying to teach me. Then the A.I they have running the place started breaking. I got the same stories everything with same questions and answers. I got the same sentences and questions running in loops. I got questions from three lessons ago back in current lessons. The voice a.i breaks and you have no idea what it's saying. It's teaching weird vocabulary terms for Spanish. I have no idea what broke but it's just flat out bad now.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy Duolingo. I know more Spanish than I would if I didn't use the app. However, after 8 years as a loyal user, at the moment I don't feel any closer to being able to speak Spanish. I can listen and read, but I'm not comfortable speaking. Maybe I need a different approach. So I'd say this app is useful for developing vocabulary and reading skills. My listening skills have improved thanks to the Duolingo Podcast. I still recommend the app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You are frustrating all my efforts to be on over 270 streak. I have full network bars, and all apps in my phone are working perfectly with the network except your app. I've even updated it, but still no network. Think I have to delete it, I hate when I'm manipulated to buy a freezer, which I don't need."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Great app, learning is fantastic. However, the ads are too loud when using headphones and can cause damage to hearing. Please either increase the volume of the language playback or reduce the volume of the ads."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Voice boxes just never work which is incredible. Just throws tens of new words at me during the story's. Don't get me started on questions that give you no indication to what the answere is. FIX YOUR APP.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Started ok as I started learning a language from scratch so everything is a new learning exercise. I agree with others about the speech function. Very hit and miss. Impossible to learn stresses in pronouncing from the listening skills Given up with Navajo because it won't accept I can't type all the correct letters with my keyboard. Latest update allows longer players to accumulate more gems to buy their way to the top of the table. Totally unfair.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it's a really great supplementary app to keep you in practice for learning a new. language. I came in with a basic understanding of Spanish, so it gave me the opportunity to test out of the easier lessons to start at my current comprehension level. I only gave it 4 stars for one big reason. The different voice recordings on the app have not been sound mastered to be similar volumes so I find myself constantly adjusting the volume as I take lessons and it is pretty annoying after awhile."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"this app is great! highly recommend to anyone learning a new language, whether you are just beginning or already know a little. No purchase necessary, and you even get pent of encouragement. Duo allows learners to work at their own speed. The mini games, events, and challenges keep the user highly engaged."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Genuinely a very good app, I have really improved my French, Irish and I have been learning Spanish, Korean and the odd bit of Russian. All that for free in a fun and motivating package is very good, currently on 157 day streak going strong! Edit: I'm now on a 748 day streak, going strong! Consistency is really important when it comes to language learning and that is where I believe Duolingo shines."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app for understanding but doesn't appear to have a way to check pronunciation. I am using this for multiple languages and each language is tailored for the special needs of that language (example: teaching kana for Japanese). Overall an excellent app, just not quite perfect."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Dropping my rating to 1 stars because there's a huge bug. Whenever using headphones, there's like always an advertisement stuck in the background playing music that I'm unable to stop. Killing the app stops it, but shortly after I open Duolingo again, the music starts again"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The lessons are well paced and easy to follow. The ads in the free version aren‚Äôt intrusive or disruptive. It‚Äôs easy to review and practice lessons. Everything loads quickly even with my poor connection. All around a great experience with no glaring hang ups and thus far an effective learning tool as i feel that i am making actual progress whereas other apps had me feeling like i wasn't progressing at all.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Cannot fully recommend. I've improved my skills, so consider that of some value. Sadly, with the exception of the stories, most activities annoy me though a few are funny. Developer monetizes a lot, from buying ""streaks"" to extending time for exercises, so good for wealthy folks. Overall, childish & distracting approach. The push to compete with zero options to truly cooperate is not encouraging. I made the BIG mistake of paying: the local library offers free options for folks who want to learn."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm so tired of the app telling me I'm offline when I'm connected to the Internet. It's been happening for the past 3 updates, I can't even do lessons. Duo Super going to waste."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I paid a subscription and I kinda regret it. the exercises are repetitive and mostly nonsense. There is no explanation for fixed phrases and the audio is not accurate at times. There are better apps to learn and practice a language, this one is kind of a scam."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is really stressful because you lose lives if you make a mistake, and a lot of the events are time related. Duolingo can be frustrating and annoying and the only way to make this go away is if you buy the subscription which is constantly being promoted at you."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I wanted to brush up my French and was thrilled to find Duolingo uses research- and evidence-based methods for language acquisition. As a language teacher myself and with a doctorate in language acqusition, this app offers a practical and effective way to learn a language in a way that leads rapidly using what you learn. Best, most natural way to learn on one's own."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is really great. My only issue is it sometimes freezes like when a exercise ends. Also, whenever a learner spotlight appears and I click on it to view it remains a blank screen only. Please look into this and once again thanks for a wonderful app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The app is good and makes is the best I've ever come across when it comes to learning international languages. But developers should please make the app more social in the sense that we can interact with people learning same language with us. I think that's another way to improve in our learning
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Very motivational - - it's kept me going for over four years on the difficult language of japanese. I also completed the shorter sequences in Hebrew and Yiddish along the way. However it by itself will not be sufficient to actually learn a language. Just a good first step.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It is a useful app. I would like to suggest one thing, please make a transliteration option for us who need to hear and read a new language simultaneously. I would also want to put forth the reuest of improving the speaking exercises on this application. Also add more Indian languages like Tamil, Kannada and others. Please consider my request."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have tried Duolingo everyday for the last month, and I really like it! Most languages (that I have tried) have grammatical explanations to accompany the lessons so it isn't just guess work. Patterns become evident as you go through the lessons making the progression feel natural and intuitive."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I am loving this app! However, every time I finish a session, the app loads indefinitely. I have to exit the app and go back in. It saves my progress for lessons, but not for target practice. It's frustrating having to exit the app constantly to continue."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"wonderful app, but leaving a review because my home screen widget isn't updating to show when I need to do a lesson. I've accidentally used freeze streaks twice because I didn't realize I hadn't actually done my lesson for the day. if I lose my streak of 155 days of italiano because the widget was still celebrating 154 I'm going to be very sad."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been smashing out lessons for over a month and I can ASK for directions but I still have no idea how to understand any response I might get. Also despite having downloaded the app from Australia, the app does includes how to say a bunch of nationalities, but not Australian. The app is sort of fun but not practical."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Edit after day 50 they switched to ai for thier programing and I'm finding things that don't add up like they used too... plus I tried to change to a family plan on the app and it wouldn't let me. I tried reaching out for help but apparently duo lingo has zero costumer service or tech support. üòï still use the app often cuz I'm still learning enough to catch the ai mistakes but I would recommend trying another app. Learning spanish which they should have down.... plus no stories to read???
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So I am currently learning Hindi & German, love how Duolingo balances both very perfectly. I thought that it would be a hassle and I would end up deleting one of them but I can get done both in very hassle free way and it is really fun. My cousin who goes to coaching center and she said that German isn't rly fun but in Duolingo I srsly srsly enjoyed learning German. I highly recommend this app"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it gets 4/5 stars because it's the best language learning app out there for free. Where it loses that last star is how it goes about it. I don't want to feel guilty if I don't have time to practice today. I don't care if I drop out of the emerald league into the sapphire league. I don't want to rush lessons so having some of them timed and when you fail, which you will, they're ridiculously expensive to keep your progress. I just want to learn a language at my own pace and way please."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been trying to login to the App but it won't respond, it keeps giving me ""your offline, check your connection message"" but I'm online and there's nothing wrong with my connection. I just updated and its still doing the same thing. Please sort this out immediately, because I can't keep it if its not working properly. Thank you"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app! Sometimes, it's hard to hear and understand what they're saying in the recordings. I'm not sure if they had the microphone directly next to their mouth. I've experienced that in the language I'm learning, not sure if others are like that. But other than that, it's pretty solid! It's pretty fun!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I think this is great for starting, but it feels like you should be complementing this with some kind of book. is this is the only thing you do, you are gonna have some holes and questions without answer. also, if feels like I need to see something more like real native speaker in an ordinary context and more grammar"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is awesome ,I never thought that I,ll got another app like Duolingo to learn any language easyly & without any language course Duolingo is very exciting to learn languages,because it is funny such a language practice,s lesson game .I think the lesson,s of Duolingo is funny , amusing & easy to learn for anyone .The app is very beneficial& friendly .As well the bird of the app 'Dup'is very close with us.It,s service is free .We can learn how to write , listen,speak&read a language for it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,You will learn any language if you pay attention to whichever works better for you between: ‚Ä¢Hands on speaking and pronouncing ‚Ä¢Reading/ typing ‚Ä¢listening to the recorded actors/ actresses (there's a slow repeat button) ‚Ä¢Repeating lessons that you didn't feel comfortable with making mistakes on or that you want to memorize Why people complain: they don't approve of the cartoon characters shown as example people. Obviously the voices recorded are real people. This app is age friendly & FREE
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,constantly bothers you with prompts to sign up for subscription. the 'game' is structured to penalize mistakes then offers unlimited attempts if you subscribe. does not introduce basic alphabet in straightforward manner. not likely to continue because the program relies on rote memorization.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,there are sounds not happening and I've reported many of them no improvement. yes I understand that repetition is important I am struggling to define gendered words so it's an immediate fail. and the app think because the use of a basic word I learnt week 1 was in the sentence that's then becomes the focused learning not the much more complex words that are the slightest bit spelt and pronounced at full conversation speed with no change when pressing tortoise icon. I have more criticisms
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo was a fantastic app, but as with so many things these days, they sacrificed quality of service in order to chase a fad. They've fired several translators in favor of ""AI"" that isn't even really AI. Now we can expect lower quality and inaccurate translations, and poor language learning. This is what will tank the app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've started learning French for about a month and feel pretty encouraged by Duo. Lessons are light but effective. I'm learning French verbal and writing skills at the same time.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm really learning and enjoying my lessons on Duolingo. The only issue I have is that it frequently doesn't want to load, and says I don't have an internet connection. Everything else works fine, so must be something with the program. If I restart my phone, it usually will work then."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It used to good for free and also hearts were unlimited after one test and ads weren't there , now it's become paid. I thought someone is giving it for free but yes everyone wants to charge , at least remove the ads and unlimited hearts I happy with that, J ust gonna uninstall, I'll buy books and would get better than this. Trust me I not against charging but I didn't like this idea. Now that's become famous they started how good turn to for profit üòû. It's good for people who pay for anything."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I'm having such a fun experience exploring new languages and competing with different people from different parts of the world ‚ù§‚ù§ I just wish there was a way for people to communicate via the app. Chatting with my friends would certainly motivate me to stay on the app and do more lessons
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app has generally got better and better over the years and that's a testament to the user design team. Two thoughts: Why aren't podcasts incorporated into the course or why don't they count towards streaks? The gamification aspect without the podcasts relegates them and they're great way to learn. I'd assumed you'd eventually let us choose between US/British English. US Eng is a massive pain if you don't use it. You're a language learning company of over 10 years - why does this persist?
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I had paused duolingo for a while. I used to hold the app in high regards but the new (since I've last been on the app) heart system is just terrible. I understand the need to make money but cannot approve it when they claim to be on a mission to make people learn... edit: now crippled with extremely long ads
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,really incredible app and really does work if you put the time in. I've been a user for years and they have improved to such an extreme level. you can really tell it's a big team of people who really care about pedagogy. it's actually incredible.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it's to much fun!! I didn't knew that learning language would be so much exciting and fun. my advice, it's is the best language learning app you were looking for and some people may get disturbed of ads shown. well, I don't care about ads instead I am happy that I got a best language learning app üòä"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"the in app purchases are overbearing and basically pointless for what they are asking you to buy, and the ads are insanely overwhelming nonstop. this app has become a borderline scam. when you speak with the accent that you should, the app doesn't recognize it which is extremely frustrating. that being said, it can still help with basics of the language. my recommendation is to NEVER GIVE THIS APP ANY MONEY and you'll be somewhat okay using it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It would be a lot better if it had a way for users to create courses for languages not supported on Duolingo. I want to learn Bulgarian, but I can't find any good sources for me, but I feel like if people can make courses, it would help a lot."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I haven't used this app in a couple of years. The graphical redesign is nice but, while I understand the need to make $ the ads are a little excessive."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's an absolutely free and awesome language learning app. I am glad that developers made such an incredible effort for improving our language skills by mixing it with game-like interface in the app and a super wide variety of languages which may transform our career. I am super excited for the upcoming amazing updates. Thank you so much for creating this app, Dear Developers."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"the free version is abundant enough to learn, and the paid version is worth the money. I learn Spanish and Russian on this app and it takes it slow enough that you have enough time to remember words and phrases. It also let's you speak, listen, and write which enhances the learning process."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have been using duolingo with some consistency for the last 7/8 years. I had good fun and learned a good lot about different languages. But the most recent updates seem to be focused on making it worst. Forums were gone (why?), really useful comments were gone (why??), grammar tips were gone (really?? In a software supposed to make people learn about languages? Just... WHY???). Ah, forget it... no one will tell you why. I'm giving up on my 1400+ days steak right now."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've learned alot since I downloaded it but there should be 1 more option so you can text people who arnt your friends! I feel like people could make a few new friends that way!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I started using Duolingo in 2022, when I first installed it it doesn't have any payment options and it was like learning is Fun and i thoroughly enjoyed it but now it's completely changed out and whatever you wanna do, you just have to unlock super Duolingo. With every mistake you'll lose a live. So learning is not fun on Duolingo anymore. Please let us learn without any limitations üôè. Atleast remove restrictions on mistake correction area. Please ü•∫"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"App is user-friendly and it's bite sized lessons are good. A separate section for learning alphabets (or symbols in Japanese) are handy. One thing I like to have is, lessons which are completed, if could be revisited, would've been nice. I hope developers can make it happen. Also if we could be able to complete with friends we follow, would be great for tests and learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's pretty good if you are in search of where to begin. I am learning Japanese and I'm in a 38 day streak today, and till now it's been pretty fun. I hope they make it more conversational, like the lessons so far are only interactive with the keyboard, i wish they could do something where we could chat in the language with a bot and it will correct us at times, about our vocab and accent too. Over-all, I'll still give it an 8/10 score."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is so adhd friendly! For people lacking dopamine and wanting to learn something AND GET motivated & reminded often to practice, it really is super useful! It can get hard to practice but duolingo is well designed to reach your goals (if you really want to learn), even if your life is busy. Having it allowed on my home screen was a game changer. We will see how far I can get this time without losing my streak (I once lost one of more than 450days) but hopefully I won't this time!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been trying to work on myself for the last few months and getting this app has been a great help to me. It helps satisfy the need to feel productive when you're depressed or wanting to improve your ability to cross cultural borders. Thank you guys for your hard work on this app, and for reminding me every day to do something towards helping myself. Je suis fort!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I would give this app 5 stars except the words practice is useless. There is currently over 800 words to practice in my practice list but the exercise repeats the same 15-20 words all from the first lessons with the odd other word thrown in. They desperately need to fix the algorithm and put heavy bias on the newest words being learned. Apparently it is the same with every language as there are thousands of people complaining about it. If the developers sorted it out the app would be brilliant.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Can you stop ruining my learning? ""We synchronized ur Chinese course to new better one"". Yeah, no. Now I have marked as completed chapters I haven't done and words I don't know marked as learned and what I was learning literally yesterday is somewhere else, who knows where. You have no idea what 'synchronize' means. It's not the first time something like this happens either..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, it's very useful to learn new languages! I think that everyone should try this out, at least one time. Duolingo makes learning easy and fun from kids up to adults. Recomendation to the dev team: Pls add Icelandic to English speakers and Spanish speakers!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is an excellent way to learn a language. The programmes are well structured and provide plenty of feedback. Even with an upgrade, the cost is negligible. You can set your own pace & personal goals. I thoroughly recommend it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Kind of fun and kind of helpful at learning another language. The weird manipulations to try to get you to spend money are annoying. It would be cool if you were actually playing against real humans each week and it wasn't just a game to get you addicted to the point of spending money.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have maintained a 195 day streak with Duo and have worked really hard to move up in my leagues. A few nights ago, I did extra practice lessons to gain more hearts and I moved up from 26 to 22, but after several more lessons with great scores, Duo dropped Me back down n dropped Me out of the obsidian league to the pearl! That makes all of my hard work useless! I'm not encouraged to continue the app because that is just not right. A person should not be knocked down an entire league! Nope!üö´"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app est super! Thank you for launching this app. However, I've given it only four stars instead of five because under the conversation section of my Duolingo, I am unable to access and utilize the ""Speaking"" section of Conversation, even after turning on my microphone and granting Duolingo access to my microphone for over 10 times. I subscribed to the superduolingo because I needed to strengthen my speaking abilities in French, but I'm not getting that. Please fix this. Thank you."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Love it, but there is no need for hearts. When you lose all the hearts, it just discourages learners,and the slightest mistakes cost you a heart. Duolingo is there anyway you could bring back the Xhosa course and add a twi,ga,Armenian, or igbo course we need more african languages and you should have I suggest a language poll,and the one with the most votes will become a course."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The overall app is good, I had fun learning languages. However, I found myself often unable to take English lessons for gaining a heart (not working only in English course, other languages are fine). Please fix this, thank you."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is only the 2nd app I've tried using to learn a language so I can't attest to how it compares to a lot of apps. All I can say is that it has been manageable for me! I do feel like it's better using this than trying to self teach on my own with a book so I recommend this app if you also struggle to self teach yourself.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,this app really does care about your foreign language process by constantly reminding you to keep up with the momentum and not to let your foreign language skills die when you miss classes for days... I highly recommend trying Duolingo if you want an app that is serious about your progress and is user friendly ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This app has become sooo much worse over the years. It's actually crazy to think how good it used to be compared to what it is now. I do not recommend this app for anything other than casually supplementing a solid language learning plan.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"i worked for 30 days on a premium account, received my reward and then the entire app conveniently went down for maintenance thus making me lose my reward? the exercises are repetitive, no real lessons on grammar and they will set you up for mistakes by including new phrases you've never learned. do not waste your time there are more efficient, practical ways to learn a language!!!"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have really come to enjoy this learning through this app. Being able to practice the practical side of whatever language I am learning is a big help. My problem with doulingo, and I think it is rather important, is the speaking exercises. For whatever reason the app does not seem to work with my mic. I thought it was my bad pronunciation, but when I let one of my friends who speaks the language try, it still did not work. If this could be worked out, I will give doulingo that fifth star."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Okay been learning Spanish and I contacted a friend who's fluent in Spanish to see how far along I am. Turns out Duolingo teaches bad habits and phrases actual Spanish speakers never use... Don't download this app unless you want to learn languages incorrectly.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been having problem connecting to the app since 5 days. Don't know if I'm the only one experiencing this, that when I put on my data, while every other apps work fine online, only Duolingo doesn't. I keep getting the message ""please connect to the Internet"" when I'm already connected. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the new version, but it still persist. Duolingo team, kindly do something, I'll be very mad if I loose my streak."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is very good and I have heard alot of people say good things but say it has a lot of ads.. but personally for me there were some ads in the beginning but when we proceed further the ads will slowly go away. I'm not trying to say the ads will fully go away but they will not come that much and also I have been learning korean from this app and I'm getting kind of better at korean so I would highly recommend this app if you want to learn any language.Thanks for reading my longass comment.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,very helpful with teaching me Spanish. a few months ago I needed to use a translator on my phone for everything and now I can hold small complete conversations. Thanks Duolingo! You make learning a new language easy and fun. muy √∫til para ense√±arme espa√±ol. Hace unos meses necesitaba usar un traductor en mi tel√©fono para todo y ahora puedo mantener peque√±as conversaciones completas. ¬°Gracias Duolingo! Haces del aprendizaje un ¬°Nuevo idioma f√°cil y divertido!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I find it a good app for free learning. Some of the ads can get repetitive or questionable content/claims but you can mute them while waiting for close button. to show. either that or clear open apps & open again.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the ways that they teach people various languages and how they try to make it fun! The way they teach me how to speak spanish makes me think of it as a game! Also, a really important part of Duolingo is that it efficiency teaches you the language you wanna learn, and it does! I know a LOT more spanish than I did before I tried Duolingo.üòä"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"looots of bugs in the android app! i'm using paid version, and the amount of bugs and errors is amazing! they should be paying me instead for finding and reporting so many bugs! Also, there is no way to see a list of already learned words in a language u r studying. Also, there is no way to ask questions - their ""help"" section only has 4 questions answered and that is it!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's fun and convenient. You can easily fit a short practice session into any bits of free time that come around. Good luck to all language learners!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have the app on Samsung Note 22 Ultra. I went back to restart the first question. When I did the review questions. All these words popped up. That were not in the lessons on my phone. The city names, numbers, croissants! If I reinstall the app, will that update the first section lessons? I have emailed the company twice. No response. I paid for the app. For my family. It seems to work well, for everyone, but me! Not good customer support!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I like Duolingo it's very beneficial for learning language from English to any other. I'm learning Italian through this. I give five star for this software. Thanks to the developers please update some features to improve it UpTo native levels as well as for core vocabulary words.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo, please the message 'You are offline', when one has a strong network connection and is in the middle of a lession, is quite frustrating and not encouraging. Sometimes for 30mins, Duo is offline. Kindly work on it. Thank you."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is sooo helpful. It taught me French within a short period of time. I recommend it to all u people who aren't able to speak some languages. But beware u must always keep your commitment to the languages you learn. Thanks for reading
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"To be honest I really enjoy this app,it's both fun, educative a time killer when ever I was to relax. But one of the things I wish this app can improve is the pronunciation of some character and words. But overall it's a great app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Good app but the course constantly keeps being updated so my position moves all the time and there's no continuity! Now I have random sections that I've missed and words on completed sections I never learnt, it's so annoying"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Superb but a few things such as pronunciation need improvement. Please improve the streak system. Remember, not all people are free, they too can be overloaded with work. So atleast, provide an extra day for the streak to continue."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"their are minor quirks, but it's fully functional. jumping ahead's quiz bar isn't perfectly synced with the number of my questions their expecting for example. but overall, good app"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"if you don't pay for super you are limited to 5 lives, lose them, that lesson doesn't count towards your streak. then have to pay to get more gems in order to refill hearts. a ridiculous feature for a so called learning app. also with regards to Welsh, the support has gone and wrong Information has been inputted towards the end of the course. also I don't want to learn to write Welsh, I just want to speak it. some lessons require you to spell ridiculous words I haven't bothered learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This app is well but it sometimes doesnot have correct sentences for example that girl is a girl and it mostly repeat the words and it just gives words and we should find the translaition it is wrong first duolingo should teach the translaition then it should teach how to make sentences and it should have logical sentences. I USED DOLUOLINGO BUT IT STARTED TO REPEAT THE WORDS AND IT SEEMS TOO EASY SO I GOT BORRRRRRRRREDü§®üò¥üòÆ‚Äçüí®üò¨üòëü´• AND I AM GOING TO ERASE DUOLINGO probably.....üö´üö´üö´üö´üö´.....
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Bug in a recent update means the lessons won't count up and progress without leaving the app and restarting it. So I've rolled back to an earlier apk that works and will avoid updating for some time.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really love the features on the app, the leader board where you can easily see your position and it gingers you to do better and win first place, I like that we can follow each other, I also noticed that we can block and report too BUT MY MAIN QUESTION TO DUOLINGO IS WHY CAN'T WE CHAT!!!! I think they should create something on each person's profile where we can chat each other."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a very helpful application by which anyone can learn a new language, not for show off, but for communicating different people all over the world. And it is necessary to learn English language because If you wanna learn any new language you must learn English. I was learning French and now I can speak French as well as English."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Please evolve: I have so much dissatisfaction with this app. The ""translate this sentence"" model of language learning is so limiting. There are too many click-throughs even on the paid plan. It would be better to have a single summary page of everything that changed after a lesson is complete. The animations are over the top but you do have the option to turn them off."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,While never the best for Japanese had been getting steadily worse and now with its heavy reliance on AI I no longer trust I'm not wasting my time learning false information. I have un-installed the app and switched to better language learning apps that don't use AI
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Hi duo ! I have some problems 1) Why are there ads after every lesson 2) Hate how we have to quit if all our hearts finish 3) Everything is expensive for non-super people 4) The quest system (I don't understand why u guys ask me to finish a unit...,how am I suppose to finish it in one day) 5) Repeated questions 6) Grammatical mistakes are not corrected if reported and they only accept the wrong answer every time and we have to accept that the wrong answer is correct and move on"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Japanese course is really inconsistent. The Super Duolingo also has a feature on practicing your words, but that keeps glitching. I like that i can practice hiravana and katakana Next to the normal courses. But there are way to many glitches since the last update"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Really helping me to brush up on my Portuguese. Although it was my first language as a child, I have become rusty. I feel like the more and more I practice with this tool, the more comfortable I will feel actually speaking Portuguese with others. I'm enjoying doing a few minutes each morning and evening and it does not feel like a chore at all. Really great app!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"What's missing here is an option to learn the real European Portuguese from Portugal, not just Brazilian. I am European and want to learn the real, original language, from which Brazilian Portuguese evolved. It's a shame that my favorite language app doesn't include such a popular and important language in its original, pure form. For those who would like to learn European Portuguese, I recommend Memrise, but if you can find the language you like here on DuoLingo, I definitely recommend it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've tried to open Duolingo for a week now and it's been stuck on the load screen. I did all the troubleshooting steps suggested in the FAQ then emailed their support team, but it still doesn't work and no one has emailed back. Such a disappointment."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is good with it's gamification experience... So encouraging. Ads slightly annoying... But I understand that... And it isn't really that bad, not too intrusive. But I have a complaint making me give 4 stars. The speaking exercise doesn't work well as it never stops recording, or loading after I tap repeatedly. Then I gave to act like I'm closing the lesson and then continue to the next prompt so I can move on. Just fix the speaking part and you have 5 stars"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There are both pros and cons of working with this app. Some annoying factors about Duolingo include: too much repetition of easy nouns; not providing enough practice or explanations of the more complex grammatical aspects of the language; not including enough practical phrases; seriously annoying and repetitive ads with considerable frequency. they do of course want you to pay for the app which does eliminate the ads. On the positive side, I have learned a fair amount with the free version."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Have been learning Korean on this app for 225 days. it has helped alot with vocab, listening and pronouciation skills. It has supported my language learning journey but it is important to know that it is not a holistic learning tool, it should be incorporated into a larger language learning plan. The game like goals make it a fun way to keep motivated on your language learning journey. Make sure to explore all the learning features so that you can make the most use of the ones that work for you!"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'll give it more stars when i detect a lesson, something that actually teaches the skills and vocabulary before throwing me into a right or wrong question and answer situation. It doesn't teach, or if this is a teaching method, it doesn't work with my brain. You ran out of hearts! Wanna not practice new material, but repetitively practice how to say, what is your name? From chapter 1. Terrible. You made a mistake! Let's punish you while making it impossible to learn from that mistake."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love it it's so easy to understand and I love how after you finish the lesson it reviews the questions you got wrong and also it's so fun and it keeps you going by setting a streak goal in the beginning and it helps you go on everyday and learn different languages I've been using it for like 3 days and I learned how the difference between green tea and rice in Japanese and it lets you pick the language you want to learn over all this is the best language learning app you could ever find :>.<:‚ô•
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Variety is the spice of language learning, and Duolingo knows it. From bite-sized listening exercises to interactive translation challenges, the app keeps things fresh and exciting. I especially love the speaking exercises, where I can practice my pronunciation and get feedback from the friendly chatbot"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Please fix the kanji tab. I'm trying to do kanji relevant to the current lesson I'm at, but because of this update, I'm stuck doing kanji from two units ago. This update also for some reason made every kanji lesson like a test instead of an area where you can practice stroke order. It's pretty much omitted from every exercise now. This is a huge blow when it comes to people using Duolingo for efficient Japanese learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I really love this app its very helpful. Thanks a lot for all your efforts. But I have an important question. Why Farsi (persian) has not been included in this app? It's a prominent and old language and is spoken in many countries. I hope one day we will see this language in duolingo. Thanks
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,it's a perfect app for anyone with great international languages and with nice pictures and I love it when you lose your streaks or one you fail to practice you actually drop and that shows that you need to practice in order to be up to date. kudos to the providers its sensational. love it
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I loved it. This app encourages the people who are studying any kind of subject also it's free. And also making us strong in many languages. So it's the best app in which I could ever study ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è it's 10 out of 10
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Thanks to Duolingo I reached intermediate b2 level from scratch. I am highly impressed with the recent updates. The inclusion of premium features and lives has significantly bolstered my motivation to engage in meticulous learning. However, I do harbor a minor concern regarding the expenditure of diamonds during rapid reviews. It's little disappointing to spend diamonds to reach legendary level for each unit. Despite this, I find the overall experience with the application to be quite enjoyable."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Mostly enjoyable, better when you've got friends to encourage you. Relies mostly on memorization, little on understanding the how or why. You're shown words and reuse them with the other words they teach you. You won't get grammar lessons. Words are used in ""sentences"" (which are sometimes just phrases) and you have to put the patterns together. It's been a while since I started so my memory of the initial lessons is weak. And they've reorganized a few times since I started."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been using for the past 6 months to learn French. I am a native English speaker who also has high proficiency in Spanish. I highly recommend the app. I use the free version, and I've complemented it with other online resources. I have learned a ton: vocab, gender, phrases, verbs, etc. If you're serious about speaking your new language you will absolutely need to augment Duolingo with conversation practice, but this app is a great way to get in basic lessons and maintain a daily practice."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I used to give this app 5 stars but I have gotten so many frustrating moments of my answer getting rejected for no reason but an outdated English sentence structuring or moments where my input didn't register. I think the hearts system sucks. I understand you need people to buy premium but the lessons length makes 5 hearts a frustrating number. Just make lessons shorter please. The only current use of Duolingo is helping you remember specific words that probably are no longer used.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It used to be better, but the app only teaches vocabulary, not grammar. This is the case even if you pay for super duolingo. There are better apps out there."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is the best language lessons app I've used ever. I give you 5 stars because you deserve it. I learned a lot of words in German within 3 days. it's been less than a month since I started using this app to learn German but I can already constract many sentences in German and they also make sure you give the correct spelling. You guys are incredible! keep it up. Don't waste your money going to school just to learn a language, just download Duolingo and you are good to go."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It starts good, but the format becomes discouraging. I like how it has you identify by sight and sound. But it will gradually include new words and phrases and grammar with no explanation and penalize you for getting them wrong. They have a 5 heart system, that if you get 5 questions wrong, you have to either buy more, or stop. Doesn't matter if they never taught what you were tested on. And some that were said we're wrong, actually were right. Unless it had to do with grammar."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Super language learning app! Motivating, playful and rewarding, lots of reviews and chances to practice mistakes. Some words (at least in Hawaiian version) are missing the sound bytes and occasionally a practice lesson is repeated verbatim several times so some small glitches could be tweaked but it's only slightly irritating, considering how effectively learning takes place. I really prefer spending time puzzling in Duolingo and learning too, to wasting time in games or social media !"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It is a nice app for learning different languages but you have to get super Duolingo to get all the features... You are very limited to what you can do like today I tried to review my mistakes but I had to buy super Duolingo... I would personally rate it a 3 star. But still a good app
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"STILL BUGGED: Still no reward for XP quest completion if the total was achieved with bonus points. The monthly quest counter does not register the quest completion either. When you leave and return, the bonus is credited, but there's no award nor incrementing of the quest counter. There used to be no issues with this."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I just got started but I really like it so far and I've learned a lot. it's very easy to use, not intimidating at all and it's fun. It has a lot of resources and tips to help you learn and fun goals to keep you motivated. They make it in to a game, so I think I'm pretty much going to replace my sudoku and word find time, with this."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,* User comments are missing! * Feedback system seems to have a long delay. Would appreciate some sort of acknowledgement -- especially when there's a year old issue with an exercise. * For Chinese or would be helpful to know when I used the wrong tone while speaking. * Thankful for the addition of Hanzi for Chinese!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is a scam of an app. I want to cancel and cannot do so on the app. I went online and the website is not allowing me to cancel. Each time there is an error. I will contact the FTC and let them deal with Duolingo. Oh, yeah, I want to cancel because the app is glitchy as soon as you buy a subcription."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have a weak knowledge of Spanish, and have wanted to improve. I have completed just a few lessons so far, and they are great. I especially appreciate that the app can test speaking skills through use of the phone microphone."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,it has fantastic flow design and teaches well but it's beyond frustraring feeling dragged into it every day to save your streak. And the mistakes when things are hard to hear or it just fails to recognize what you said. At least you can 'practice for hearts'
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Boring, lies, and UNFAIR. When I started Duolingo it was a fun for me to learn Spanish. As I got more and more committed, I realized there were quite a few problems. 1. If you are in Android you don't get many things. A few years ago Duolingo released Duolingo Math, promising it would be in Android soon. 3 years later, Duolingo Math coming to Android hasn't even been heard. 2. All in all it's just a quiz game. It can't really teach you, anything in the long run because it's only questions."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,app is very nice and encourages language learning so much... I love itüéâ love the update... it makes it somehow less bulky for learning I'm not giving it a full five-star rating cos it's not perfect but they still do their best and that's what matters... thank u for teaching me my fave language... now I can communicate better with my friends üíñüíñüíñ
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love using the app to learn different languages, it is fun and educational. But it restarts my progress constantly. I was on unit 6 in Spanish, but I open the app to find that I have to start from lesson one unit one. Very frustrated."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Duo Lingo is good in many ways but it's definitely geared for younger users rather than adults. The Spanish vocabulary they teach are mainly words which are very similar to English words. There is alot of repetition of the easy words rather than ones you have to think about more.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Thank you. Not amused. Only thing you are doing, is forcing people to get Duolingo premium, which I thing is not ok. Though you AI model is really good, but it still have flaws. I'd like to learn Spanish, but things I learn are in the bucket of things, that I will never use in my real life. Like in college. There's one other thing. My foreign language is Czech, and I use English as my primary language in my phone. So far, I didn't find out, how to change my primary Duolingo language. Shame."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really love how functional and high-powered duolingo is. I'm only on my third day of learning Korean and duolingo has taught me basic but easy steps to start talking. (FYI, when using duolingo you still have to practice talking in the language you wanna talk in, you can't expect to use duolingo without any practice.)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is a very good app which help in learning any language very easily. I have learnt 2 languages from it and it was such a easy üòé task I love duolingo and recommend every on e this app please support and rate this app. And the bird duo in this app always encourages us. It also has a feature day streak which shows the continious days we have done this class
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great app but still has some errors and you need an extra app or textbooks to further study the words. I also facing a lot of cheating learners (they are gaining a lot of xp in a short period of time) to be able to reach the top ranks. I am enjoying a friendly-competition and it sucks to face someone like that.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app doesn't work when I use my mobile data, it only works when I'm connected to a WiFi. Please do something about it,it's making it difficult for me to take classes as I'm not always around WiFi but apart from that the app is amazing all round."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The ads are excessive, and the app is too focused on extrinsic motivation (too gamified, constantly ""rewarding"" you with gems and fake badges). However, it is a very slick tool for refreshing your memory in a language you already know but rarely practice."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I'm a beginner in learning French. I overheard someone talking about the Duolingo app. I downloaded found it very interesting. Within 2 weeks of being on Duolingo I have learned a lot. I believe by time I'm 6 months I will be speaking French very well. May God bless the Duolingo app and all persons involved.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo provides a friendly learning environment making a beginner easily understand and remember words as well as their meaning which makes one eager for the next learning session cause each day makes you realize you are improving. The platform gives you the chance to continue learning even when you are not able to pay which is not like other platforms that will shut you out. Just try it out and you will not be disappointed
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Duolingo for a while.However recently even if I did my lessons daily,in the streak calendar it's marked as not done.I even got the message where they say ""you extended your streak before.....(number ) of players"" however when i check the next day,the app has used a streak freeze,even though i did my lesson and extended it. But now the bigger issue started yesterday. My streak freezes had ended so,the app has sent my streak back to 0. I am very sad as it's stressful to beginagain"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The content is good, a mix of vocabulary, grammar, and useful practical phrases. The many incentives, rewards, and prizes tend to be a nuisance though and take up too much time and space."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good for reviewing a long lost language. I doubt I would learn a completely now one very efficiently.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Works if you put in the work. Dynamic lessons help retention; reading, writing, speaking, visual queues. Liked the timed flashcard set up, helps get it into longterm quicker. Knew some spanish, figured id finish course formally. Could skip ahead some but im grinding from sect 2 up.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo was great when there was a comment section and forum. It was the real strength of the Duolingo community with an enormous database of explanations of the question at hand, putting things in context, as well as widening and deepening knowledge of the language and culture. All built by generous voluntary help of moderators and students then just thrown away. Also, the previous tree system was way more useful, and pleasant than this path which forces all to the same pace. I'm truly sorry."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have been using Duolingo since 2019.But I am truly disappointed with the recent changes.Learning is meant to be fun and free from unnecessary distractions.After every lesson one has to watch an ad.And it doesn't update the points correctly.Full of bugs.I understand you need to make profit,but this is simply not done.I no longer enjoy this app as I used to.And out of nowhere it keeps deducting lingots for purchasing hearts, when I can earn a heart by doing a lesson.It has truly lost it's charm."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It was one of the best game I ever played. I really enjoy the learning while playing. I've been using this app since 2022. I really appreciate the effort of duolingo's whole team for making such an interacting game. I also recommend my siblings to download this game to learn new languages. What's more you can also play it on PC. Keep going...ü•∞ü•∞ü§óü§óü§ó anyone who's still thinking to download it, it's my suggestion for you just click on the install button. I bet you wouldn't regret it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I am finding Duolingo a great way to motivate me and to help me consolidate my learning of Scottish Gaelic. It would be 5 stars if the audio was more reliable. I dipped into French and found there was a considerable difference in the courses and wish Gaelic could include more audio comprehension stories.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, it is helpful and supportive at all times. But, there's an issue going on with the animations. The characters and the owl aren't moving or acting. They're just stuck as an image. Please fix this bug ASAP..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Sometimes the functions slow down but then gets fixed the next day. Apart from this, learnt a lot from here. Lessons can sometimes get confusing but seem to be okay the next day. Bit of ups and downs but overall great."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"As someone who has always struggled to stay motivated while learning a new language, Duolingo has been an absolute game-changer for me. From its vibrant interface to its addictive gamification features, Duolingo has turned the daunting task of language acquisition into an enjoyable daily ritual."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Love the app! I just wish that there were more speaking exercises. Also, this is random and may be a sensitive topic (I truly don't know), but I've noticed that the majority of the examples in stories are homosexual relationships - mostly lesbian. It's just my opinion, but it would be nice if the story examples were equally inclusive of every type of relationship."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love this app. It's having me learn faster than how my French teacher taught us French because she turned it into learning Emotions. I'm in a different school now. The Japanese is confusing. I knew a Japanese word before the teacher even taught us it and when I said it because she forgot a part in the word and I got a class point. Anyways. I know 175 words in Italian. It's really easy to learn with this app. I have super duo so maybe not for everyone that doesn't have it.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Okay app and does a good job of gamifying learning a language. Not a fan of it making you feel like you need to maintain a streak or keep up with ""friends"" in challenges personally. Would rather not feel forced to keep using an app myself."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,My most favourite app. I can honestly say life changing. A fun and engaging way to learn a skill that quite literally expands the world you live in - and it is perfectly functional without spending any money. Really duolingo should be taught as a model of how to do it right...
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,excellent app for language learning and allao free but now the subscription has come and ads are started coming which interripts many time to learn language I want to try the speaking and listening part but i cannot try because of subscription.. I think u should remove subscription part please and it is a really nice app for language learning u can learn several languages which is really nice. Thanks duoüíó
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Doesn't teach you anything. Just tells you you're wrong or right with no explanation. I've failed to start a new language twice because it expects me to know things I've never seen. Also uses very useless vocabulary for a very long time in order to show more ads.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The step by step method of teaching is very impressive.. There are lot of exercises for practicing and enhancing your vocabulary. I am satisfied and enjoying my learningü§ó.Also their streaks and leagues play very important role for one to remain engaged with his/her learning...
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Good language app, bad device syncer. I used Duolingo to learn random languages for fun, but when I couldn't use my phone, I used my laptop. Oddly enough, the streak didn't count it and I lost my 400 day streak. Please fix this! New: Its now fixed! Thank you Duolingo!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing, motivates u to study by keeping streaks and getting rewarded fr them, teaching how to speak, listen, write with fun exercises. It requires Internet connection to play though, also their premium version is very affordable but their free is very fine too"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a really good app. It teaches you in detail how to pronounce and read a lot of the main languages, and they also have made-up languages like Klingon. Overall, I think this is worth it and I would sincerely recommend this app to anyone wishing to learn a new language. Don't throw caution to the winds though, this app doesn't have EVERY single language in the world"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I really like Duolingo it has allowed me to learn many different languages in a very fun way. I like that whenever I have time to spare I can get on and practice. I would like it more if I was able to win more Super Duolingo Subscriptions for free üòÅ!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Studying here is so fun. It doesn't look like studying at all , it looks like enjoying a game. So even after practicing a few hours , you'll stay fresh. And as they have a ranking system , you always want to complete your lessons level. Cuz the more you complete, the higher your rank."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great for repetition and keeps you motivated by constantly harassing with notifications. However, the voice recognition is terrible, telling you that you are incorrect when your pronunciation is perfect and you are correct when you get it wrong. Also, the 'practice to earn hearts' feature in the free version doesn't give you the hearts after you have earned five. Good for practice but not for much else. I use in conjunction with better apps."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"at times it may feel slow and repetitive, but repetitions have proven really useful for long term memorization. Also, do challenge yourselves to legendary levels. Having no hints gives you higher satisfaction... when you actually pass"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"an interesting method to learn a language but it'd be very thoughtful if duo teach us the importance phrases such as whole introduction first and then about fox, escalator and manzanas....also, the important thing is spacing and punctuation.... which is not differentiated well yet.... overall, it is a good app+ motivational"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,hey been having a lot of fun on the free version. lots to offer and they regularly give you the subscription benefits to show you the difference first hand. there is a good reason they have become so popular. I'm learning having fun and it's free and on my free time. I am a Happy Consumer
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"As someone who has a strong base in Hebrew, some of the translations are very literal and are not used as they dont make sense. also it doesn't tell you if it's male or female, if you didn't know, you would get a lot wrong. lastly, the vocabulary taught isn't much. there is lots of repetition which is good but can be annoying especially when you may be craving more words."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm getting really annoyed with the lack of customer service on this app. I have paid a lot of money to this company just to get rid of some ads, and they can't even seem to answer emails for support. My daughter can't even join challenges with us. We can't see her progress at all. And everytime I try to contact someone, it's a dead-end. I would cancel my subscription if I could get my money back. My daughter is the only one who's account can't interact with the rest of us."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Too many glitches with the app; getting dumped out mid lesson and having to reboot the phone to get back in. This happens during speaking lessons. I've done hundreds of lessons but revision asks the same dozen all the time, which isn't helpful."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Thoroughly enjoying learning Spanish on Duolingo. It's fun, easy to use, and has genuinely helped me start learning for travelling to Spain. I would like to see an option for removing written exercises for those with dyslexia."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When pressing on words for help, it's some times not what they're looking for.Pronunciations and translations aren't always the same which makes it confusing.Moved me up lessons because of ""changes"" and skipped so much.Too many quest needed to get the medal it's not even encouraging. Having a busy day)week makes you feel bad for not doing more than one lesson.Losing hearts and not being able to complete quests.Overall I've lost my love for this app.My 1539 day streak close to ending."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I have been using Duolingo for a while now. I am ok with the ads too but it's been glitching a lot. The bugs are getting worse day by day. Recently the whole app crashed and restartef while I was in middle of a lesson. I hope you can fix it as soon as possible. Other than that everything is great.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The learning is fun. I enjoy the gamification and the challenges. But customer service is absolutely horrible. I bought a family package and the system never let my family join. I tried to reach out to customer service but I guess there is no such thing for these guys. I feel generous giving 2 stars.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Excellent app. A great way to learn a new language. I have the free version and do 5 to 10 minutes a day & am making steady progress but I'm sure one could be fluent in a year or two putting more time in. Highly recommend
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I think its the best option for learning a language beacuse when you run out of hearts you can always get more by practicing and there is also challenge's to make it fun and you can compete with other people in the leaderboard.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"So far, I'm enjoying the app and learning from it. I would like a bit more explanation regarding conjugation of verbs used in certain situations. Perhaps that comes later...as I'm very early in the program."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very good app for learning English. I really like this app,and i learned a lot through this app. This app is helping many people in many ways. Children can also learn english in a fun way through this app.And they will not be afraid to speak English later.It is helping me a lot to learn english too. this app helps us to overcome our fear to speak English. it is very helpful for us"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Love the lessons! And the style of learning is very friendly. It could use some structural elements to bolster technical understanding of the language instead of using a purely conversational approach though.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"A good app for beginners, but has its flaws. While learning french, I had to answer a question where I was asked why Pierre wrote an email instead of a letter. All the phrase was correctly written besides the fact that I wrote ""he"" instead of ""Pierre"". And it counted as incorrect, even if the question didn't ask specifically for his name."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,there's not enough focus on vocabulary especially with pictures and the politeness level is high formal which is not how people normally speak. when I go to review by redoing lessons they are always the same so it appears that nothing is actually presented in my lesson based on my personal progress.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I thank Duolingo for teaching me Espa√±ol which is a new language for me. The app is top notch and the lessons are super effective. I love the awards which are super inspirational and the reminders come in handy. I am looking forward to learning more. I am glad I met Duolingoüòò
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,several bugs - often don't get points earned for completing lessons and it doesn't pick up your speech very well when doing speaking lessons. I've used this app on two different devices and have the same issues.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I am learning Spanish for 22 days long and I love to learn it from Duolingo thanks for creating such a platform where I can learn a language with such a unique style that make me more interest to learn it but the thing which I didn't like is the super dual package which I cannot take properly because it's all over a year subscription where I am looking for per month subscription it was easy for me but I cannot make it because it showing its per month basis but it's taking the whole year amount.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"fun and a remarkable tool, but I recommend having a pad of paper to take notes as well as a grammar book to learn rules. the system tries to get you to learn rules by repetition, as children do, but we are grown-ups, and just reading rules can ease learning. Also, my voice is deep and gives the speech recognition trouble, so I find that it works better when I speak in a falsetto."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I signed up on February 8th, then canceled on the 11th, they informed me that it would be canceled next year but it has already been canceled I can't use it and they still charge me on my card invoice how am I going to pay for Something It's not active, I can't use the course and I've been trying to get in for a contact with you for a long time"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"AWESOME PROGRAM, GOT ME HOOKED IMMEDIATELY. However, I wish that gems were more attainable to do more legendary exercises. They will challenge me so I don't see why they shouldn't just be added without using a crazy amount of gems which takes a lot of time or purchasing Duolingo. BUT OVERALL, GREAT APP!!! I'M LITERALLY ALMOST FLUENT IN ESPANOL. IT IS AN ENGAGING LANGUAGE APP LIKE NO OTHER, WITH FANTASTIC REMINDERS AND INCENTIVES TO CONTINUE LEARNING."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have been enjoying the app. For some time now because it's helping me to learn Spanish without stress, keeps me busy, entertaining and not boring, but since yester night (10/03/2024) it as been asking me to connect to the internet that I am offline when I am already connected and other apps are working fine, I went to update today (11/03/2024) but the problem still continue. Should I stop using the app or there's a solution to it?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Well working app. However it gets a bit boring after a while. Would be cool if the types of exercises changed or something new was introduced when progressing to keep interest and motivation.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"2 major things wrong with this app: word review always uses the same base words that I confidently know. It's a fantastic feature, but I can't maximize how much it helps me because I cannot remove words that I don't need to continue to practice. 2) they do not consistently explain why I'm making a mistake....they do not consistently explain how the grammar works. If I don't understand the grammar, I don't know how to Google it, so how can I learn what I'm doing wrong?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So far it's a great app, but I wish I could see all my learned words somewhere in the app. That would help me remember when trying to make sentences during conversation. Edit: I don't know if my comment was the reason they added it or if you just have to get to a Certain Amount of words to see them all But it's there now and I'm very glad. 5 stars"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a fun app now but I'm worried for it's future. Last week, they got rid of their human translators in favor of AI. Context, inflection, and slang are all something humans do that only a human can translate properly. If I wanted poor, but semi-servicable AI translations, I would learn via Google Translate."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"this app is awesome! I am currently taking french as course and it has helped me in practicing however, I wish to say that it will be great üëåüëå if at the beginning there's learning french alphabets , sounds vowels e t c I believe it will help the user learn how to read in french faster with wondering what the meaning of a word is every time a new word pop up."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a very useful app , we can easily learn any language. But the thing is, the same excercises repeat again and again for some long.So,it is irritating to do the same excercises repeatedly üòí ."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app! It helped me learn any language I want in only 1-2 weeks! Duolingo is one of the best apps to download if you want to learn a new language! On top of that it is so fun to learn because of Duolingo! Download this app and you will start speaking a new language in in 1-2 weeks! ‚ù§
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love Duolingo, and it has helped keep me accountable to my goal of learning Spanish every day. I do wish there was a glossary of all the words I've learned, and an option to select nouns and verbs I want to practice."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"you used to be much more accessible, we didn't have one minute of practice time. now it's really about getting us to pay. I think I tried paying a few years ago also and if I remember correctly I dont think it worked. so basically paid and nothing changed. as far as learning I suppose it's a good program."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Duolingo. Really helps me keep the habit of spending at least a couple minutes learning Spanish every day, for over a year now. It's enough to help me understand what's going on around me while travelling and make basic conversation. And it's fun!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duo really helps to learn a new language. the price for a year is really good. i wish we were able to print out a report to study along with but maybe one day they'll change that. the best language learner app i found

Every single button tap that leads to network request is unresponsive, sometimes leading upto half a minute of button tapping.

Not worth the premium anymore Edit Dec 2023: the listed issues have since gotten fixed, the app works great again"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Good app with only worth if you are paying montly subcription. In free version u can afford only 3 mistakes before waiting for lives to recharge. Usually that means u can barely finish one lesson. But overall good option to learn language
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,the written sections are a nightmare. dyslexia makes them almost impossible. a skip button would be very nice. because in some exercises I can't complete them which is discouraging. which is why I have left three stars.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It has some quirks but overall a good practice tool. Missing language coverage for some courses. For example if you are Polish, like me, you need to know English to be able to learn Portuguese."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent, it takes you step by step in a fun way. The exercises are set up so you succeed and feel excited to continue to the next lesson.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"While the majority of the app and content is good, there is issue with rapid review and some pronunciations... the screen freezes when the time runs out.. this is what prevents me from buying the super plan"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"At first, it was interesting and all. But slowly, it gets boring. Same tasks are repeated over and over. Even when there is a new vocab or grammar, the process is still the same. I hope you guys would add something different."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Maybe it's because I use the app on my phone, but the Mandarin course is repetitive. The words in the tray are obvious. You could answer the listening questions half the time without speaking a word of Chinese."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hands down best language learning tool I've used to date. Myself, my partner and her daughter are all addicted and improving Italian quickly for our holidays this year. The competition element is slightly over the top for my liking, but it does encourage engagement."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a fantastic app, I've been using it for a few years now but with the latest update the predictive text strip on Gboard is no longer visible meaning you have to type each word completely. Each lesson is taking much longer now."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"very intuitive , brilliant , yet I encourage the team to figure out ways for those who's native language isn't supported by duolingo either by adding more native languages , or implementing methods that allow anyone to start learning a new language with lessons that don't require an understanding of a specific mainstream language ."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo helped me a lot, but it feels like it wants to trick me into using the app forever. After using it for a couple of years, my learning progress stalled. I will continue to learn by reading online artikels on a website with free artikels in 1000+ languages."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Pisstake. I got the 14 day trial and then AFTER it asked me to create an account to which I tried, but it said I already had one so it logged me into that (apparently i had an account 4 years prior and didn't get past the first lesson) to which it then stripped me of my 14 day trial which is still on my Google account, and when I try to add it onto my new account it won't let me. I now have no trial, no progress and no way to redo it. Its a scam"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"duolingo is very helpful, and i definitely recommend it for learning a language on the side for fun. i can't speak about learning it professionally because i do not. i dislike the heart system, but im just salty i fumble up sometimes ‚ù§Ô∏è"

But I have one problem, I want to learn arabic but I know it's alphabets and pronounciation already because I am from Pakistan. We have same alphabets in Urdu language as there are in Arabic, if the developers add the option to skip the alphabets or seperate it from other lessons, it will save me a lot of time. üíñ"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Hello dear Duolingo. Your app is performed the best why should it be. I'm learning French and Italian in this app and I'm really satisfied but I should complain about something. I don't know why you don't support Iranian language. Not only Our Language is famous and historical but also you have lot of Iranian users which cannot speak English but they want to learn English through your app so please add Farsi language too. Thanks dear Duolingo.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm leaving this 1 star review until you make the Match Madness challenge doable without paying money. I already have a super subscription, and completing the 3 star challenge of match madness is IMPOSSIBLE without buying additional gems to make it easier. This is predatory and beyond frustrating and the fact that this is present on an app that I'm already paying a subscription to is unconscionable."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I am enjoying the ease of learning new words. I just wish that Duo would let me revisit older lessons, or do more repetition of words, phrases, and letters that I learned early on."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I've been doing Duolingo for a year now and the one thing that annoys me more than anything is the button sensitivity as sometimes I'm just going towards a word and I accidently press the check button but I literally just grazed it!!! And when I'm in a rush and I'm low on hearts and Duolingo mades me lose a heart I get quite sad as it means il be late for whatever I need to do later as I failed the lesson so Duolingo if you guys could just make the check button slightly less sensitive it'd beüëç

At the end of the episode, it was written that I would be given 40 points with doping, it gave me 5 points because I'd the events fast, but it calculated it out of 10+5 and with the point doping, it GAVE ME 30POINTS WHICH it SHOULD GIVE ME 40POINTS. There's the same increase in points in my ranking in league. There's a complete calculation error. Please find a solution to this. I can't get what I deserve!(It happened again)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Really accessible learning using all teaching methods - listening, reading and spoken. Lots of repetition to ensure new words/phrases stick and loads of rewards to keep you motivated. Love it"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"App provides good incentives to keep going. Though I don't think the japanese course is made to help you understand the language. For some reason they teach me how to say I'm a 4th grader and a high school student, how to buy pencils and scissors. This while I still don't understand almost anything in japanese entertainment. I can't imagine why anyone would go to Japan to buy erasers and pencils for their 4th grader kid. They teach specific tasks, but I'd prefer to know common words to recognize"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love when Doulingo gives you three days of super free. I enjoy the features super provides. The courses are easy but I would like a second that lets you practice on conjugating verbs.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,it is good but the animation in the previous version is removed and it takes a long time to update and when I have done two quest in the same time I didn't get the rewards from both chests this is the reason I have rated it only 4 stars
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Missing features from the other versions of the app like rearranging words without having to clear input, viewing the vocab list, etc. Aside from those missing features the app is good."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good but doesn't really help you learn a language. ""The fastest way to learn a language"" is not true! Also, as always, it is better on iOS. Example: It only has Duolingo max, music and maths on iOS."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love the learning experience variety. Sometimes the voice actors speak way too fast and do not pause at all between words, which is not my experience when watching Spanish TV."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have been trying to learn Spanish on and off for several years. This is by far the most helpful tool that I have found. I am learning and retaining the words. I'm getting the information I need to know how to properly use the words in a sentence. My children are also using Duolingo and they are learning at a fast rate and enjoying it at the same time.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My Italian lessons are entertaining and varied. I know I'm learning however I think I would probably learn quicker if I googled afew more explanations of the grammar when I had questions. All in all, Duolingo suits my learning style."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,you guys have just stunned me with how much effort you have to make to get on the way to go about knowing ways to which you can continue learning and finding new ways to go and keep learning and finding new paths to get to your top of the way of getting through to the path that they dont often see to the lay down all that you can to get to the top of the leaders care when you have the want and the proficient in over all the languages were something I wouldnt shy away from leading the path. :)
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is flawless in terms of functioning, however it's terrible for learning languages like Chinese. It is merely a game of matching the forms of letters and words written in Chinese without any explanation of what it means in plain English or any other language. There are options to match pairs, learn how to write and speak it, but none of them explain what they mean"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,So frustrating that they suddenly instituted this heart thing. I PAID for the app and can't use it whenever I want. AND it takes away hearts based on the apps technical difficultly in understanding my speaking. I am going to pursue a refund.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. It starts off slow to give you a good understanding of the basics, then moves on to more difficult areas of language. I have completed 21 days so far and I feel I'm starting to understand quite a lot of Spanish words. Very quick and easy way to learn another language. 5 stars from me!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I just started using duolingo, to learn Portuguese. I think the app is fun and the style of duolingo really helps me in particular. The audio and visuals help the information stick with me."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app has been pretty good so far. I'm currently studying Chinese at a level 1/grade 1 level at my Chinese School. I decided to download this app so I can learn more and learn more advance than my Chinese lessons, and it pretty much helps me with my Chinese classes. Definitely Recommend."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is great and helpful for learning languages but after day 68 the widget didn't say that I needed to start a lesson which caused me to use 3 freeze streaks, overall it is a brilliant app for learning different languages and sayings"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I used Duolingo when it first came out and enjoyed it but wished it went into more detail. Starting back and exploring another new language, I appreciate the changes. I am enjoying the breakdowns offered for new vocab sections."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have been using Duolingo to learn Chinese, and it is constantly helping me acquire more vocabulary and learn sentence structure. I check vocab and proper usage with native speakers. All in all, I really appreciate Duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is so great. All the different learning methods are so helpful. And I love the challenges. It all keeps me really engaged to meet my goal of learning a second language.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I like duolingo. the only complaint I have is that there are some parts if the lesson where you cant see all the options that are available. also some of the lessons dont give you the option to correct your answer before you check it. it can be very frustrating when you know the answer but are not afforded the chance to submit it. please consider these things I have pointed out. It will make learning a lot more enjoyable. muchas gracias
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have used Duolingo on and off for a few years and have really enjoyed it. Recently, my experience has changed with new practise reminders that use language such as ""don't make duo angery or sad"" and ""hey its Lily, practise or not I don't care"". The passive aggressive language in reminders is not welcomed. I would suggest going back to the friendly reminders asap."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"4 stars only because I wish it was easier to understand some of the logic behind some of the grammar. Also, wish there was a way to get full stats of the language instead of weekly emails. Overall, love this app and love using it to keep learning my french."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Learning on Duolingo used to be really helpful. However, over the last few months, it just repeats the same ""weak"" words, which I mastered quite a while ago. I would love to keep learning, but I don't know how much longer I will keep repeating the same lessons, with no apparent way to move forward."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It is really good at helping you speak another language that you want to learn. It even helps you Say it And with duolingo plus It offers you more. You can work On the part you are having trouble with. And no ads either.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,As of 1/31/2024 it appears Duolingo has disabled the suggestions bar on Gboard without an option to opt in or out. I will not be resubscribing if this isn't reversed or made an option. I get the reason why but having suggestions actually helps learning more than it hinders.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Was a great app but no longer have keyboard Suggestions or voice to text option. Both helped me confirm correct spelling. As my goal is to be conversational. Correct spelling is not a concern at this point. To lose that option would most likely have me stop using the app.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Aside from having my language track reset due to an update to the curriculum, this is an incredible help for studying. I still recommend classes as it doesn't give enough in-depth knowledge about language structure but otherwise, great once you have the backbone of knowledge about the language to keep your skills growing."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I am learning German with it and it works; one thing I really miss is the users comments on each lesson; many times I'd find really helpful insights from users about words, sentences, the reason behind why things are how they are and so on. I don't know if it got too spammed, but I'd appreciate it to come back. Also, it's annoying having to undo all the places words just to put one that you missed in between, there should be an way of just dragging it in place."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"sincerely saying! i only spent three days learning on app and I'm now able to talk in French. and you don't just learn, you also have fun . if you commit yourself on this app, only one year you become a fluent French,... speaker! thank you Duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It does the job but what I can't get over is everytime I finish a task or a lesson, the app just gets stuck on a loading page which I assume is supposed to be an ad. I have to close and reopen the app to get it to work... please can this be fixed."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's so well designed, makes clever use of repetition and sprinkles in new information with old information so as to make the learning experience less overwhelming and daunting. Perfectly paced, satisfying, rewarding, everything I could ask for. Can't wait to get Super Duolingo! :3"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app . But there is 1 glitch that there is option that says "" can't listen"" if you click it should not show any listening exercises for next 15 mins but sometimes it shows again listening exercises. And you should improve the learning characters more !!! And app is good"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The audio sucks. They use Google translate audio and most of the time sounds off. I asked my Japanese teacher ( university, Japanese of origine) to take a listen to some of the words and she corrected like 20 words."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's not perfect, as some of the translations are incorrect. also, sometimes you can pronounce things perfectly and it will not accept your submission. overall though, it's pretty fun and you do learn a good bit."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Honestly sick of the app. Been a fan for years. The updates in the last couple years have been bad. Bring back the discussion comments. Make it easy connect with speakers of the same language in app. You're going in the wrong direction in a strong and steady way. You're corporate brain has ruined your decision making capabilities. It's anti-human. I'm strongly considering not renewing my subscription.

Thank you duo!!‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è Edit: after updates there are few issues in this app. Please fix , it would be better. 2nd Edit: Till now everything is fine.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I like Duolingo. Person can really learn a lot in an easy and enjoyable way. But there a some big mistakes in English version that I came across and I can then only think is it the same in the other languages that I am trying to learn. I did notify them few times with no response at all. But if they would be willing to take care of those problems this could be number one language learning app.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The original layout of having many different open options is better than one path. I would spend more time trying to learn Spanish. If I got stuck, I was able to move to another area and feel successful. This one path makes it much harder. Which isn't the purpose of learning a new language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I'm giving it five stars because it's an amazing app to learn any language of your choice and you can do lots of things with it. I'm in love with this app even if you didn't have a chance to study it'll remind you telling you whether you got 5 minutes to spare its a user friendly unlike the other learning apps that I know. Also they offer you with 60% discount of the subscription but if you not want to subscribe you can cancel it and still learn I recommend this app to anyone 100%
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Depends on the language. If you use this for a common language such as German or Spanish, the pronunciations are very clear. If you decide to do something like Korean the pronunciation can have three separate words sound identical and in one case almost bugged. I opened the words up in an audio software and they match. The robotic pronunciation is not clear but if you type the word in Google and pronounce you can hear a clear difference. They need to fix this."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very fun and lively, not many ads and beyond helpful in learning a new language! I've been doing the Spanish course for about a week now and have also connected with friends. Muchas gracias y buenas noches, Duolingo!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This ok if you have something else on the side teaches some basic rules and lessons. Otherwise you're just kind of fumbling through with trial and error. But of course when an app has Hearts they want you to fail enough to pay for the app. It's a business, not really for learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is a very interactive and engaging app, it has the best possible tasks but the reason why I gave it a 4 star is because it contains a lot and a lot of listening exercises. Apart from listening there should be more questions like picture and writing which rarely comes in a lesson."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo does a good job of teaching languages. My main complaint is they do not have the option to focus on certain sections of a language; for example, if someone is traveling to a new country and wants to learn just the basics so they can communicate to order food, ask for directions, etc. Duolingo starts with more random lessons (how to say a doctor or a lawyer, for example) rather than what I feel would be much more useful."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very good app, and it's very simple to follow. It keeps you motivated to learn every day, and you don't have to pay. It is free with ads, but they aren't too bad. Even if you decide to pay, it's not too expensive and I imagine it is better and quicker to learn. I'm very impressed with it and love to go on it every day and every day I'm learning. Definitely recommend it üëå"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Rating one star because the move to AI is incredibly disappointing and will make language learning quality go into the toilet. The whole ""firing absolutely everyone who isn't in IT"" move was pretty horrible too. The overly aggressive monetization, the extreme downgrade of the app's gamification, and the abandoning of professional work all just coalesce into a language learning experience I can only describe as insulting to the languages and their speakers."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The program is really helpful and fun to use. Only towards the end of the course and in the ""daily refresh"" the same phrases are repeated over and over while others are never practiced. So it is better to review the old lectures."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Helpful app! But please change the narrators and voices, any lighter and more delicate voice there? And please, put this option to chose competitive or noncompetitive. This games and competitions work for many but not for all. It's so stressfull and I avoided using this app for several months just cuz of this and annoying voices!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app,I'm still new but I'm having a good time. I just can't use the conversation speak tool. I'm using the trial to test out all the features and that one isn't working. I'd really like to carry on paying for the service after the trial ends but I can't pay while some functions don't work"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,i really was enjoying the app so much so as to get a trial period super duolingo subscription. I am not financially stable enough to afford subscribing for the real thing and so cancelled the subscription immediately while retaining the trial periods perks. However i have just received a yearly transaction made for duolingo which i am still trying to resolve in my situation. It clearly says cancelled on the play store so i cannot report a problem and request refund. Any help would be appreciated
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am a linguistics graduate student and I have been using Duolingo for nearly 10 years now. In that time, I have seen the quality decrease dramatically, from having useful grammar tips and forums to AI-generated sentences that are incorrect, nonsensical, and unable to be fixed by users. The removal of human monitors is the death of this app's utility as a language-learning tool. Humans simply cannot become productive language users under this new format."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Easy to do, and you will be told to do it. Constantly. Downside: Only the app's wording is correct.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The application has bugs. Sometimes it stucks and you never know when exactly it will run again. Some of the translations are strange and you loose hearts without reason. You should have in mind that we try to learn a foreign language through another foreign language. And both languages are not our mother tongue.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I did the Vietnamese course for fun and it's absolutely horrible. There's no excuse for it to be that atrocious. For example, ""What does this word mean? Rate."" and you have to type your answer, only the answer for rate as a noun is accepted (which is actually the translation for ratio), not rate as a verb. Or ""When do you start?"" can only be ""B·∫°n b·∫Øt ƒë·∫ßu khi n√†o?"" not ""Khi n√†o b·∫°n b·∫Øt ƒë·∫ßu?"" And all the voices are Google Translate voices. It's like this course was made by AI not real people."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,at first i liked this app. it had no ads but now it's really hard to progress... but if you wanna be an language expert you surely need duolingo but remember it's a helper. you'll also have to use grammar and get a teacher. It helped me a lot to learn many languages. you will also find out that this app is great for education.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Can't manually download course for flights. Same goes for my daily commute where I don't have mobile data. What a joke, not sure why I paid money without this feature. It's 2024, it shouldn't be that hard to support offline functionality."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"For the speaking lessons, It picks up complicated sounds well, but the simplest sounds like (ee) or (ah) don't register ""correctly"" for some reason. It's frustrating having one mistake be a simple sound especially when there's really no other way to pronounce them"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pretty good, I guess, but a bit too tedious. They could skip all the weeks making us talk about horses eating oranges and get straight to the words and phrases one is most likely to need in everyday life abroad."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've used this program for years... It was never amazing for learning a language but there used to be a comment section where helpful people would explain each lesson. Now that's gone. They removed it for no good reason. The lessons are now terrible and completely unhelpful since they're made with AI and not explained properly. If they re-add the comment section, I will increase my review substantially. Until then, skip this app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app was much more useful for actual language learning when we had to type sentences ourselves, instead of just clicking on the given words, which is incredibly boring, super easy and not expedient. Now we're just chasing eachother on the leaderboards, collecting XP, protecting our streak. Is this a game or an educational app? And pushing an ad for premium version after *each* exercise won't make me buy it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great for learning, sucks that past achievements are erased and current ones don't stick. I've completely the new years event 2 times now and it still removes it once I leave the app. The rest of the app is soild and grammar needs to be added but the rest is good :)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love this app but suddenly the speaking exercises do not work for me anymore. I have sent many emails and have gotten zero responses. I suggest getting the other Duolingo app because it works. I guess it is actually a browser app? I don't know, every so often it tells me I should use the app which is confusing because I am on an app. It's exactly the same as this one but it works on the speaking exercises. I'm leaving this review in the hopes that Duolingo will return my emails at last"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a good jump-start into learning a language and there are work arounds to keep the learning going if you run out hearts to use. If they could incorporate a solid conversational enhancement it would really take the app to another level.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like the many different ways they help you learn vocabulary. You slowly learn grammar, maybe a little too slow for my tastes. The ideal would be a simple grammar book to supplement the dynamic exercises of duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There has been a steady decline in the quality of the courses. Some of the less established courses offer translations that are barely better than Google translator quality. When Duolingo first came out, live persons would respond to customer feedback on incorrect answers or acceptable alternatives. I haven't seen that in almost a year. Nowadays it makes me feel like I'm learning from Google translator and halfwitted AI fronted by a green owl. The app is also more buggy than ever."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pretty good for learning so far. Using it in my free time is nice and the scoreboards can be fun. I do wish it would pronounce words more often in lessons, as sometimes it doesn't pronounce anything at all, which makes it a little hard."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've loved Duolingo for several years. However, since last few days there's an extremely irritating background music playing all the time during lessons which makes learning extremely difficult. Monitize, but please don't make learning difficult."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like duolingo. It's a very interesting app with very cute emojis and stuff. I would love to rate this 5/5, but my problem is when I save a picture it won't be in my gallery. Except that, duolingo is amazing. I highly recommend it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a perfect language-learning app, blending gamification with diverse language options. Its user-friendly design, adaptive learning, and engaging community make it an ideal choice for effective language acquisition."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Don't like the fact that a paid subscription is so expensive. You would get more subscriptions if it were for less money. I hate monthly or yearly subscriptions. Just let me buy all content for a fixed price of maybe 500 for life. Let's not forget that I'm doing all the work myself. It takes discipline and motivation from my part.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Its decent, but sometimes the audio wav files don't match the actual words and you'll get things wrong and lose a heart. But overall it makes learning like a game, so I find myself trying to race through content and not understanding it as well."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a great way to start learning a language. it not only gives you the vocabulary, but also helps you hear the language. plus, it is not boring and is often funny. just a heads up: it is also relentless in pushing you, bug 8n a cheerful way"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is an amazing app to learn any languages you want , it inhances your speaking confidence . Day by day , it becomes so interesting to learn as it maintains streaks and if you forget to learn on the next day , Duolingo will remind you through email . And the best part is , it's totally free of cost !"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Been using for about 2 years, although there's ads now it's so much less compared to other apps.Also there's only beginner lessons for some languages,having intermediate lesson would be really helpful."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I have dyslexia and find myself learning the pattern/placement of answers in a unit unintentionally. If a question needs an answer with a particular ending like „Åæ„Åó„Åü and only one answer includes that ending its too easy to just select it without looking at the remaining characters. Need a way to adjust the speed of voice step by step or to a particular area. Replaying an entire sentence is frustrating. Having a way to contact support and ask questions would be awesome.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Way worse than it used to be. the heart system is actively discouraging, and completely stops you being able to learn through experimenting with getting incorrect answers to test the boundaries of what works and doesn't. this is not a language learning app, it's a game."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is an ok program. It doesn't teach any sentence structure lessons, and while you'll probably learn to understand the language (in my case, Italian), it's doubtful you'll become any good at actually speaking it yourself. Also, I do NOT appreciate all the notifications saying that so and so took my 3rd place or that I've ""fallen to #7"". I'm in this to learn a language at MY pace, not for some competition."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have spent the past 3 weeks talking to people at Google Play as there appears to be no way to contact Duolingo that actually works. So I've spent ¬£50+ on an app that I had for about a month. It is a simple problem that needs resolved or a refund should be given but it is now at the stage that the app developer has been reported. Shame.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"**Duolingo Review: Efficient Vocabulary Retention, Natural Grammar Learning** Duolingo excels in vocabulary retention through its spaced repetition system, ensuring words are revisited at optimal intervals. Its context-based approach to grammar allows for natural acquisition, seamlessly integrating rules into activities. Overall, Duolingo offers a balanced and effective language learning experience."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a fun app, it has the best language lessons but recently after updating the app, it is not working,I couldn't take lessons again,also couldn't see my badges again, it keeps on saying network error Even when my data is on. Pls fix it, before it is too late. Nothing has been done to my complaint yet"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is really fantastic app for all the people as it is accessible to every corner of the world!! And it's it's really good app of students or children.It helps learning to things and languages!! I suggest u too use it Also! It's also a very fun app to communicate and it's eco-friendly ! With fun learning also.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"While learning a foreign language, the duolingo concentrates on proper English grammar, even though the meaning of the translation is correct. Also, in some languages it does not offer how each word sounds when clicking on the word."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is really great, but lately there are more dark patterns appearing. With the timed challenges, a popup appears to buy more time for gems. If you were typing an answer, this means you click OK without wanting to or being able to cancel. This makes it feel as if you are forced to buy more gems even if you already pay for super. Really not a nice experience, so I have to avoid any timed lessons."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Extremely disappointed to hear about the decision to replace human translators with AI. Learning from native speakers was originally a huge selling point of Duolingo, sad to see that trashed in favor of an inferior product. Deleting the app, not sure why I should be interested in using a service being offered by people uninterested in actually producing it properly."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app overall. It has a fun learning experience and helps people learn the basics of the language they are trying to learn. The only disadvantages with this app are it can only get you so far with what you are trying to learn and it isn't the best at teaching grammar. Overall, I would definitely recommend this app but you do need a different learning strategy other than Duolingo if you want to become proficient with your language skills."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"it is a great tool to learn languages, but the way it works is very stressful. It seems they just want you to spend money by creating a ranking that looks to be fake. It seems like the contestants don't exist. Also, it doesn't take into consideration how difficult the lessons are to give you points."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Overall the app is really good and I love using it, but I'm on Android (Googls Pixel specifically) and I have to open and reopen the app multiple times before it will work as it just gets stuck on the loading in screen. Really frustrating as otherwise would be a 5/5!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've been using for 4 years now. I enjoy this app. It's weird but the app staying on and clocking me when I set it down is an interesting legal save for me. As a trucker i could potentially be held liable for learning to talk to the diverse community that is trucking including human trafficking victims ie illegal dock workers. Thanks for the design flaw. Can't see when I sleep like social media apps. Not allowed to learn. so much will sue me.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Duolingo for 2+ years, and it's definitely helped me refresh my Spanish. It is not at all comparable to my high school or college classes. However, what's led me to uninstall is Duolingo recently laying off their lessons staff to replace them with AI. The lessons are already weak and full of unpredictable errors, and using AI will only make them weaker. That doesn't even touch on ethics of the matter, which are also despicable. Do better, Duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"very repetitive phrases with less opportunity to learn new sentences, the app doesn't cover the very basics such as alphabet, numbers, days, weeks months, shapes, clock work and grammar teachings, with this app the learning doesn't teach how to speak/make sentences, but on the bright side the interface a nice, it is graphically and aestetically appealing,"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it's okay. the biggest value of duolingo is the streak. that keeps you tied to the habit of learning. but it's only good for a starting jump off point, to really learn you'll need to branch off with diversified methods of learning. 100% an app worth using tho, no doubt."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Always losing progress for some reason. I speak French very well and learned it in school, I simply have French as an option for me to practise and keep my skills up, but for some reason every time I jump ahead and pass a unit, when I come back to French from Japanese, it sends me back to Unit 1 for French"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is great for building a solid base! If you're a beginner in language learning, start here. Even as an intermediate in French (I'll be testing for my B2 diploma soon), I start my day with 45 minutes of Duolingo before moving on to other activities."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"If you actually put in the time, you can learn another language with Duolingo. No app is going to make a person one day able to speak another language unless effort is put in. The fun activities that Duolingo provides makes it exciting to learn! I've been learning Hindi for the last few months and it has been great!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm enjoying learning Italian. I plan on taking a trip there in 16 months, and I'm hoping to have a decent handle on the language by then. I like the consistency and the continued reaffirming lessons. It's helping me retain the language. I plan on paying for the upgrade to get a better experience"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,it's very fun to learn a language with Duolingo. obviously there is some problems but it's a great app I would recommend. (some of the problems are like ads and the fact you have limited lives after you fail. you can get a membership to work around both of these though.)
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have been learning Japanese for 2 days and already I know so much! I had the option to put the Duolingo widget on my homesecreen and of course I took it! Now whenever I go onto my phone I remeber about Duolingo! Also, its not just learning, Duo makes it fun! Its like playing a game! I absolutely love it! It teaches me sooooooo much! As well as that, you can learn any language in planet earth! Its sutable for any age, as long as you can read! 5 stars! Would recommend! ITS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I've been on duolingo since 2014 and I've seen a lot of ups and downs. But for the last six months it's been mostly downs. They got rid of the original tree & forced us onto a specific path. Annoying but w/e. Then they got rid of forums where people would helpfully explain how the grammar worked in a particular sentence. Bummer. But now at the beginning of lessons it's just examples w/ no grammar. Quality is degrading noticeably too. I'm sorry I just paid for a yearly plan too.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Used to be fantastic, but they cut a bunch of staff and started using AI and the lessons declined in quality pretty much immediately as a result. If they roll it back and rehire their staff to create consistently good content again I'd consider coming back, but until then I'm canceling my premium subscription and looking elsewhere ‚Äî they've demonstrated that they're willing to kick their employees to the curb and compromise on educational quality out of greed, and that's unacceptable to me."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I mean I'm not really learning the language, more so just picking up some phrases, and really just being exposed to the language if anything, but it help get my brain going in the morning. for that ya get 4 stars duo, nice one. I am a proud holder of a 412 day streak as of March 3rd 2024."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Pretty dang effective. Slow and steady definitly wins this race. It builds a sturdy skeleton for you to fully flesh out. Only thing I dislike is forced super duolingo trials. Super takes away all the consequences of error and for me that's not a good way of learning.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Happily used this over the years as an aside to self teaching through vids with native speakers but I'll never be using it again after the layoffs & replacing actual translators with non-credible AI. Ive already noticed errors & native speakers I work with see them everywhere too. Absolutely disgusting taking jobs from people to use algorithms that don't even do the job correctly. I'll be urging every single person I know to either quit using this service or never start. Shame on you duolingo.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"nice app, but my ONLY problem is when I close the Duolingo ads (eg. family plan and Super Duolingo ads) and select no thanks, it replays the ad. This has been so annoying to do lessons that I have to close the app entirely and reopen it to fix it. I don't get this problem with any other ads on the app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Hello Duo, I don't know what's wrong, but the app suddenly stopped connecting to the Internet even though my network is working fine. And somehow, I lost my streak because of it even though I did the lesson. I'm really upset about this tbh."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Learning Finnish, it was harder than other languages (e.g. no explanation ever) but I liked it. I even paid for the extra. And after 1,000 words and barely scratching the surface of the language (e.g. the only past tense word is ""was"") it was over and the daily tasks just got increasingly boring because of repetition. Why not teach more? At least new words maybe? Or at least not the same 20 sentences..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is the best app for language that I've seen so far, they have a lot of course. and the app makes it super easy to learn by the test method, so I really recommend it for anybody that wants to learn new language. Au revoir."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really like Duolingo. It makes learning languages fun. However, they stopped supporting the Welsh lessons. Ever since, the personalized lessons section is stuck on the unit I was completing when they discontinued their support. Honestly, anyone who is learning a smaller language should be prepared for them to discontinue that language as well."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It keeps saying offline even when I'm not üò¢. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it went away but came back after I completed one lesson. What to do? Why did you remove the leagues feature üò¢? And the word matching lesson? This is the best language learning app ever! I got so frustrated with some other apps that I almost quit learning a new language until I encountered Duolingo. This is definitely the right choice! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"this app is soo good, I can learn french through it very smoothly, I prefer everyone to try this app It's excellent, I gave it 4 stars because if we have to make streaks we want hearts and sometimes we gain the hearts in the exercises so we are not able to make streaks this is little hard for learning. but definitely download it !"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"4 years running streak, great habit to get into. superb for vocab, does lack sufficient expectations of some of the grammar introductions and peculiarities. these have been removed from current versions and the comments sections removed which is a shame as they were really helpful"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like this app very much, it is by far the best free app for learning a foreign language if one is too busy for intensive classes, but after the latest update it keeps getting stuck, you can't write the translation and you have to start again the same lesson from the beginning. Even 3 times, just to get to the end of it. Quite frustrating."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The perfect learning app. I am blown away how good this app is in teaching you a language. Not even 7 days in and my brain already know words and sentences that i never would have thought. Its easy and fun to do. And i love the tracking system. Makes you wanne achieve stuff. Can recommend 100%
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a very good app and please support this app the only problem is that the hearts continuosly get subtracted and there is a lot of ads but it's very good tommoro is my German exam I downloaded Duolingo and that why I am ready for tomorrows exam Thanks Duolingo for supporting me the characters talk very politely to me and also convinces me every time. this was a wonderful, fabulous, great,super,and jhakas experience of mine. Dil ko choo lene wala app hai bhai ye. love from raj, India"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,it is very helpful and when you are in a middle of the lesson and decide to leave it gets a sad face from which I don't want to leave. it is great for people who want to learn other languages. I don't see any problem with it plus you can learn other languages even if you are doing another language for example: if you are learning Japanese and Chinese then you can but separate you will know what I mean after you download it
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been using duolingo for nearly a decade. To hear about the use of AI is disappointing. There are so many other routes to take this company, including the use of AI, that doesn't put computers in the jumpseat of teaching language. Back to books, I guess."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I mean I'm compelled to learn. The speaking lessons are sub par, probably would be best to find a community or person to talk to to better your speech skills, instead of relying on the AI to tell you when you've got correct pronunciation, since some people speak in their native tongue and still get scored wrong. other than that I'm learning. Though I wish the guide book would update based upon which lessons your on, so before starting a lesson you can study words and how to use them correctly."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"i rarely, if ever, make time to drop a rating, but duolingo deserves high praise. thank goodness for this FREE app! I'm launching a business in Brazil, so learning Portuguese is a must. duolingo is as engaging and entertaining as it is educational. the story exercises make me laugh out loud-- literally! SUCH a better use of my time than scrolling through social! thank you, duolingo, for this gift of knowledge and life skill!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very good linguistics app. Sometimes, certain words are easy to forget, but the app itself is very fun and enjoyable. I only truly dislike the fact that you have to get super Duolingo for basically everything."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I like the lessons and I think the repetition is helping me to really get it. My big problem are the VERY ANNOYING Super Lingo advertisements. I am going to look for another language app that does not push premium products so hard.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I personally have no quarrels with this app, and I think it's wonderful! The competitiveness is just enough, the friend adding features are great, and so are the lessons especially! I like how Duolingo kinda leans into the memes on YouTube, too- :) Overall, I think it is fantastic for learning new languages. (I am learning German, my first language is English.)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When data is on,ot's taking a lot of time.Sometimes it literally get stucks in same green background.If I turn off my data and then turn on.It shows you are offline.even though I am online.Son I can't complete my daily learning.Please do something fast.I have even uninstalled it thinking the problem will be solved.But I am now stuck in the logging page."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I really like to learn on Duolingo as it make multiple practices and a variety of practices make it more fun. I am learning Japanese and it's very interesting to know that I can learn any language by just one app and develop my soft skills
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is a great app. It makes learning feel like a game! The only downside is that you have to pay to have no adds and unlimited hearts. (you get 5 hearts a day after a mistake -1 one)
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've just started using duolingo, but I'm having a great time with it. It seems easy enough to start. I will see what my French is like in a couple of months.That's my timeline, not theirs. then I will give a much better review."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is really very good, most of the time. I have had a few problems with upgrades recently with the German language. It seems OK now. I do enjoy the learning experience. It is a good exercise for the brain."

Duolingo is now apart of my daily routine on my way to school. Make sure to download and learn today."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Lots of good options for learning languages. I wish their Japanese program was a bit more structured, but for a beginner it works."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Strengths: grammar, natural accents, engaging and fun. Weaknesses: needs more real-life conversation practice, more opportunity to develop audio skills."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,very good app you can also easily use it without taking premium and it has best tech and anlaysis . but can do better if duolingo adds sanskrit also . btw it is the best for your one of the skill devlopment
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Would be 5 stars, but after a recent update, sound sometimes doesn't play? Deleted app cache and data, signed back in, audio is still unreliable. One question it might work, the next it might not..."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love the app, love the way it teaches us how to learn but I'm giving it a 2 star Because it doesn't have the language that I want to learn.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"the reason im rating it a four is because, yes it is a good learning app for kids but kids make nore than just five mistakes. kids learn by there mistakes so it is not necessary to put hearts there. yes i know you can gain then back but at what cost? they try and make you buy the premium because of that as a bribe."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Literally zero customer support. Even for paying users. How can a multi billion company not have any? Their 'submit a bug' form is broken both on web and phone making it impossible to reach them. There are no phone numbers nor email addresses to reach, so if anything is wrong good luck."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's pretty easy for a daily user.. and much more entertaining for learning a new language... I just loved how it teach Me. I would like to take classes if it were a Teacher.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,it's really good app for who is going to another country like I'm learning Korean and i learn a little bit Korean and btw I'm giving four stars because some people doesn't understand english and they wants to learn english but they can't because it will be German's language and people who can understand english it's good for them so please finish this problem
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The lessons are easy to understand and engage with. The reviews of mistakes and what was learned,helps strengthen the language learning process. Also, I appreciate the reminders to learn."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I never knew that I can learn something new for absolutely free. I used to think that duolingo will charge some fee after some levels to continue but No! Duolingonu r the best!!! Thanks for boosting our knowledge for free.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I think learning the language is good, just started polish and going well, but I think right off the bat starting is a big hard, there's not any basic learning at the start, no introductions or anything. other than that so far very good"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,only negative I could think of is sometimes there is a word in a question that isn't translated. mainly for the sounding off exercise. Great app otherwise.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Wonderful app to learn German! Begins from the scratch, and getting one familiar with simple words and sounds before getting to the complex one. I'll recommend this app anytime to anyone desiring to learn German!üí•üí•"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's really a awesome learning app. We can learn many languages with fun. But there should be a list of all online players so that I can see who are playing or learning with me.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,perfect to help actually learn when you're teacher doesn't do anything or is just realy bad at it.üëç But to be honest it does actually feel like a game which helps with my ADHD keeping my attention for longer than 5 minutes
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love it! It is motivating, encouraging, I am having success and learning my language of choice. I also love how many languages they have available. I'm excited to master my first choice and move on to more."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Not recommended for people who are serious about learning languages. Streaks and leagues are very frustrating, I wish they could be turned off, so I would not feel bad about not opening this app for 1 or 2 days."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"A very great app, but the issue with it telling me I'm offline despite me being connected to the Internet is a big off for me, please look into it!!! This is verrrrry bad, I can't even do one lesson in peace again, always cutting me off mid learning, that I'm offline, what nonsense is this for God's sake"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,it will help you with whatever you need. you can learn ALOT of languages too! it's just ads it doesn't pop up too much just a little it's the adds bother me.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,it let's me take a break but the only thing I don't like is how many hearts you have but so that's why I'm putting 4 stars but the Korean is good sometimes I can't pronounce the words but everything else is good l can make my own avatar and take a break!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have always wanted to learn a new language specifically Italian & French & was always told its too hard. I was nervous & this app has made it so fu. & exciting to learn Italian. I cant wait to keep going & see what else i can learn!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I'm tired from the problems with it. What's wrong with this app again? Where is the audio on the English Spanish course? Why does it download so long if the internet is good? Every week we have updates but every week something bad happens again with the app. Why?
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is awesome because it's like a game and I try to learn a language from so much apps but I can't and on the first day on duolingo I have learn so many words if you are looking for a awesome app so try this is awesome and there is no ads for distributions. Thanks duolingo make more app like this
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Update...this app is not Christian or child friendly as they push h#mosexuality throughout the entire app. No reason for men to have husbands & women to have wives in a game.It's Not free really because if you make a mistake it ends the lesson and gets rid of your progress. You have to pay to continue. There is no review area to re practice what you've learned. I can't find a way to restart lessons. It might be good if you pay, however they are secretive and sneaky about the cost. Beware."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Good content, but poor implementation cause issues with text layout, content audio frequently disappears - wish it was as reliable as the incessant ads."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's just a fun way to do education in around 2/5 months I've already learnt how to have an actual conversation with someone Chinese I know so much now this is one of the best apps out there it's very good and the best thing is that ITS FREE
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Negative stars because I have lost a 56 day streak because of a bug that duolingo wont fix. I cant login because it was my highschool account, and on top of that it keeps throwing me out. Im so done with this app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"worst learning app. when I make a mistake l lost a heart and sometimes I have less hearts so if I make a mistake he will lose my progress. please try to remove heart system or please give us more hearts per round and also add a spin too where the player will get 1, 2, or 3 hearts or he/she will get 20-50 gems."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,it's pretty good for boat learning but they spend zero time to fill you in on masculine vs. feminine words (i.e. un vs. una). it would be helpful to know that. I had to go look it up separately on the internet.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is a very good app. With this app we can learn many languages very easily and with fun and because of duolingo we can connect with many people from different country
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's good, but it often fails to mention language etiquette rules like what not to say to an elder. It is good as a short term introduction to languages."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is a very good app for learning foreign languages. it is very effective and simple exercises in which you can learn foreign languages

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Are you testing our ad tolerance? The duo ads are 2X as long and reset if you change screens. It's quite annoying and having the opposite of the intended effect. I will never pay for the premium when you're this annoying
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's a good app to learn language but has a lotnof glitches. I keep practicinh and it says heart earned but it does not. My score does not reflect correctly as well.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have just started Duolingo so that I could learn more japanese. This app has been so great and it has teach me the words slowly from start. Now I know better. I'm doing so much better in Japanese class now! Thank you!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is the worst possible way of learning a language. If you make a mistake it literally stops you from learning a language for 4 hours and doesn't even explain what you did wrong. It also takes away your hearts even if you have done everything correctly and it's full of bugs. If you want to not learn a language but you want something to get on your nerves I highly recommend Duolingo. What can I say; nice app. Additionally the whole leaderboard idea makes Duolingo look like a game, which it isn"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,They have errors in what is colloquial and accepted in the real world vs what the app will say is correct. The conjugations in some languages DON'T NEED THE DEFINITE ARTICLES!! THE CONJUGATIONS TELL YOU WHAT THE ARTICLES ARE!! This app is a game with lots of adds begging you to spend money. At higher levels they have errors.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I learned many words by themselves. I like the fact that the free app allows you to practice everyday and reminds you to practice. I also like that it says the words as if a different person is speaking so that you can hear the pronunciations at different speeds. The conversations are very hard for me to follow I don't think I'll ever learn Spanish. because I lose interest often & can't stick to things I'm not going to pay for the super duolingo.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"this app helps me so mutch with my languages, at the moment iam learning irish, this helps so mutch as iam going there soon, duolingo helps me learn it quickly and save it I'm my brain.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a great app if you want to learn a new language while having some fun. I've been practicing a new language with duolingo and I've made so much progress thanks to this app. If you want to learn a completely new language with this app but you don't know if it'll help you, let me tell you that this is the perfect app, in my opinion, to learn with"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's definitely a lot better than other Spanish learning apps I've tried. it is challenging. you become faster at recalling words and phrases, and the constant repetition helps. 12 out of 10. Will recommend to others and start my kids on DuoABC"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The rewards that are time unlocked seems to be based on a timezone from the other side of the planet..., earlybird at 3pm is not exactly when you might expect it... It's good that speaking challenges can be disabled as the speach recognition is poor for Swedish, however some rewards are expected to have it enabled and requires a number of those challenges to pass, which are basically impossible..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I was happy with Duolingo until recently, but it is no longer possible to do the speaking exercises - my microphone isn't being recognised. I don't seem to be the only one affected. (Samsung A40) Can you please try to fix this? Then I'll go back to a 5 star rating."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I am currently learning Russian and it's teaching me so well it is so nice barely any ads and when you mess up it takes you back so you can redo it like a second choice and you can have these little widgets for you're duo I have a 18 streak And I will legitimately cry if I lost it I love this app definitely recommend ü§©:D.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Can you explain why so many features are missing from the android version? Doesn't feel right paying the same price and getting less out of it. No achievements, no monthly challenges, just one daily challenge instead of 3. And that's what I noticed in a couple of days, god knows what else is missing. Has nothing to do with location, availability etc, only difference is iOS, my partner got the app at the same time I did, same location, yet they have more"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Hangs with 3 loading dots after every lesson, the only option is to close the app. Tried clearing cache and storage, and reinstalled multiple times, but it still does it every time. Edit: it started working properly after a few weeks"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app disabled the keyboard suggestions with the latest update. The app is now just a spelling and typing test instead of focusing on language learning. Where I could get through 10 lessons in 45 minutes, now I can only do about 5. I'll find another app that isn't focused on wasting my time."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"pretty good app would recommend for beginners. One problem, though. Sometimes, when I do a lesson and I and I complete a question and press 'continue,' it will just freeze, and I then have to restart the whole lesson over again. Duo, please fix this. Bro duo l8ngo if you don't fix this now I'm deleting the app"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Almost mastered the Russian alphabet. One or two lessons from completing everything, and all of a sudden, I can't progress anymore because some idiot fkd up the answer. The ""correct"" answer has ""e"" written as ""e"", when it should be ""ye"". But, even when I ""fixed"" my ""e"" to match, it said that since I didn't use the special ""i"" with the rainbow accent, it was wrong. My keyboard doesn't produce that symbol at all, and it's never been a problem elsewhere where the accented ""i"" was needed."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,this app is amazing . And I'm very impressed by it's learning technology. I'm learning French and Korean. And it's very impressive how fast you learn from this app I'd rate this app 5/5 since this helped me progress in those both languages. I'd be very thankful if duolingo adds Thai language in it. And the technology is pretty easy too.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a fun app. The lack of direct teaching is its downfall. Instead, you have to learn by reasoning through the new words. It has some errors in the possible answer sets. Sometimes, clear pronunciation is missed and mispronunciation is accepted. If you test out and skip ahead to where you type your own answers, you may not know which word of the same meaning to use in your answers. Overall, it is useful and fun. It is better used as a supplement to a more traditional course or course book."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,it's an awesome game with lots of helpful lessons but what is slightly annoying is when you run out of hearts. After though the regenerate quite quickly.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Update: this new version doesn't give you double xp if you finish your lesson after the time period for double xps are up. The previous version gave them to you if you started your lesson within the double xp period. Please revert back to the previous version in this respect! It is useful for teaching you a new language while on the go making good use of commuting time. üòä
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app!! The free version gives you everything you need to get started and keep making progress in your language learning journey, and the lessons themselves are engaging and fun! The format of the app is also easy to understand, and though there are ads in the free version, they only appear briefly after lessons. It doesn't feel like Duo is trying to push premium subscriptions and other apps on you, and there are no buttons placed in such a way as to make you pay for something accidentally"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Much improved in the last few years Last time I used Duolingo was 2019 and it left a lot to be desired. I am very happy to say that I can no longer truthfully say that as it has greatly improved and is effectively helping me learn French. It has also impressed me with how many languages it has available.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this language learning app for a few months, and it's truly outstanding. The user-friendly interface makes navigation a breeze.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very good accomplice to normal school work. Kept my french up during the holidays. Gamification helps with the motivation which means I always practise every day. Would recommend to learn a language or/and get better grades. Free mode is alright but Super Duolingo (paid subscription) is definitely worth!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Honestly the best way to learn another language. I love this app. They could provide you with more than 5 hearts. But I've gotten through most lessons without needing more than 2. I like that they made it a competition. And that you can play with people you know. Keeps the app engaging. Genuinely glad I started using Duolingo to learn another language.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Some words and sentences are repeated ad nauseum, while whole categories (e.g. question words) are merely dealt with quite briefly. You are also given terms to memorise, with no background on declination. But it is a handy tool to gain some basic vocabulary."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's great over all but my problem is I'm dyslexic and I couldn't handle being thrown into writing in a different language in the first few levels I tried learning Irish but couldn't wrap my head around the spelling I don't know if they have an option for it but I would love it if I could study the words more before moving on
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,There is a problem with the word banks and it makes you lose hearts and its been going on for quite awhile I thought there had been some changes to get around it but its not always there. Also some of the ads are scams.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It would be great if displayed graphics showing strengths-weaknesses in learning areas such as reading, grammar, and listening, enabling users to improve in those aspects. and show the achievement score, like 89/100, instead of just 100. I noticed Duo offers music and math lessons in ads, but why aren't they available on my device yet? Also, please consider adding Tagalog lessons as I'm eager to learn that language, but I haven't found a learning system I like in other educational language apps."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm finding this a very useful and effective app to use. The constant pressure to maintain the streak forces me to use the app, even if just briefly - better to learn with. I'd love a bit more explanation on why the language (in my case French) does, rather than just learning it, but my progress is constant."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"great language learning app. the best there is actually. only issue is that some languages when doing the speech lessons will still incorrect you. Chinese for example, repeating the sounds will take a heart away because the language is so specific and sounds are so slight. if they notice even a fraction of a difference in your pronunciation it'll take a heart away."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app is good but I hate how you need to pay for hearts or practice. And the practice only gives 1 heart. I would also like to have a pause button for the streak. Sometimes people are busy and stuff. And don't have the time. At least make the practice give 2-5 hearts by how good you do on the practice. It would be nice if you fix these things. I also think there should not be a super dulingo because people might not have enough money so mabey a year streak you get a super dulingo.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It was very helpful for learning language but I got problem in it as many kids or children use this app to learn even I am a kid and i am 9 years old however is using this app they know it has a day streak if we miss a day to practice it resets our streak and many of them have there exams in which can get disturbed in studying in which they can get worried of there streak even I have my annual exams going on which is making me worried that I will lose my streak, but this app is very helpful ! ."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I'm extremely irritated that I've paid for the full version of this and I have to shut it down and restart it between every exercise because it keeps freezing between lessons! I've lost so much progress because it's not saving!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If the point scoring competition system motivates you prepare for huge demotivation. You will be grouped with people using cheats to learn 38 languages and score an impossible 30,000+ points per day. Forget about honest competition. Thanks for the setback Duolingo. Cheaters ruined this app along with Duolingos decision to not ban them and group honest players with cheaters. Keep raking in the money for those premium cheat accounts"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"what are the best language programs that I have found so far, Durango is one of the best language programs that I have downloaded in the past 2 years. very easy to pick up it's language teaching skills and learning the pronoun and adjective of each segment within that language."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,honestly awesome I like that u can really use it unpaid and the ads aren't too long or tricky. Also u can learn multiple ones at a time! üòÅ Love how Duolingo reminds me to practice and the phone widget is so cute!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is the best app for learning language. We can also learn languages other than our mothertongue. It is really the best learning language app . I have also learned some Japanese and Korean in there days only . please use this app if you want to learn any language . I am learning languages like Japanese and Korean for fun but if you want to learn languages seriously you can use this app .
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Spanish learner: this app has very good pacing for me having had 2 years of Spanish classes before and forgotten it. It is a really great review and learn. I can even use the words I learn from this to be better at my waitress job. Apparently this new place I moved has heavy Spanish speaking population. My old home area had 2 families of Spanish speaking so I forgot almost everything. So glad to use this app though. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DEVELOPERS, AND EVERYONE WHO PITCHED IN."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"love this app, it's easy fun and has improved my Spanish in just one month. The subscription may seem steep but is worth it for serious learners. You put on what you get out, but it's easy to lose yourself in the lessons and pick which exercises interest you the most."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Awesome app, very user-friendly, helps make learning fun. I forgot how much fun learning a language can be and how it cognitively assists in neurological plasticity until my beautiful son, reminded me."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,it has helped me so much in learning the new language for the country which I will soon be going to for college but unlike babbel and other language apps. this one's free! which is the best part and you have all kinda of different types of learning. highly recommend.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I can't get hold of support for 6 months now trying to resolve numerous issues they have so maybe this review will finally get someone attention: 1. I can't add my kids to the family plan. The bottom is there but nothing happens when you click on it. 2. Once the kid sets up the profile there's not way to change it so if you accidentally clicked on a picture of a boy and you kid is a girl good luck convincing your kid to learn the language as a boy. 3. The app constantly freezes.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app, 10/10. Premium isn't required but it makes it a lot more enjoyable, I just wish there were other ways to get Premium plans and not just a one off for a month or an entire year up front. I think the Premium is definitely worth it if you can afford it yearly."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's incredible how effective it is for a language learning app. Highly recommend the Plus version. It takes 60 days to gain traction. It will not teach you how to speak a language, but it will give you the vocab and basic rules for you to finish your language learning journey to reasonable proficiency. The Dutch course made it easy to convert my Afrikaans, and allowed me to level up my A2 German to speaking proficiency (finding the confidence is something DuoLingo cannot do though)."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is the best app for learning, but there are some mistakes. First, you don't teach us the letters. Second, you have to start by getting to know each other Third,should a review of all word that we have learned. Fourth, add Persian please thanks for every think"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Doesn't teach you things you need to speak fluently as and the hearts just get in the way of your course.also the points system is bad. however, it's still good to teach you the basics and has many language options."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Had to update my review down to one star because it became apparent how they try to push people to go premium. I noticed MULTIPLE times the app had marked my answer as ""incorrect"" only to then show me that my answer was literally one of their accepted translations... Which is a clear move to eliminate the lives you have so they can tell you ""you can practice all you want with Plus!"" I literally have a screenshot of my answer on screen, with their accepted translations, and they're the same."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,this game has made me learn an extraordinary amount over the last few weeks I have had it. It balances the game aspect and the learning perfectly. The only criticism would be that you get a 2x score boost right as you are finishing up making you stay up really late üòÑ
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duo was great for a long time, but apparently laid off a lot of translators recently to replace with AI which is a huge no for me. And honestly the ads for the paid feature have become way more frequent than actual ads. Leaving for another language learning service."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I wish I could learn something like Croatian or something. Instead I'd have to download pimsleur or something. I really like duolingos format. I would pay for that service. I'm sure pimsleur does great, I kinda use it now, but I perfer the colorful set up of duolingo. I respect the ads, and understand that in order for me to get language lessons for free for now until I'm sure I can stick to learning the language, they have to run ads. Hopefully more languages will be produced soon."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Ive been using this app for a little over a year, and even pay for a family plan. I was extreamly disappointed to hear that duolingo laid off 10% of their translators and are using AI. I am vehemently against the use of ai in translation, and have no interest in learning based off ai translations, as they are often extreamly stiff and inaccurate. Which was already a known issue with duo's methods. Unless they vow not to use ai, and rehire their translators I will not be renewing my family plan."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's almost realistic. You guys gotta add auto read on every exercise so the pronunciation will stick, its great to learn to speak but it isn't properly, it got really schooled talking to natives in the language I was learning. The app keeps moving me in between courses and I don't have the time to complete all my quests, and I cannot compete and improve like the app wants me too, very frustrating and very contradictory."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This is such a fun way to learn!! I love the competitive aspect of the leaderboard and different leagues! this app is also very effective! I've learned so many new words! I am a bit bummed about Duo not adding math and music for Android yet though üòï
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app has a solid foundation for which to work. It is fun, enjoyable, and productive. After completing the first unit (I have gotten to A2 in Babbel) I began to see that the app is teaching you how to speak in the other language to your detriment. Duolingo is arguably forcing users to build bad habits when it comes to getting to know another language. different languages have different word order but Duolingo, forces users to translate the words into your native word order, sabotaging learnig"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, apart from the fact that it helps me actively learn my language. It operates ethically balancing running a business- being profitable with ensuring it offers value to its customers. I was not convinced about subscribing to Super until they gave me a few days to try it on. Even without a subscription, there is not much value offered. Thank you guys. Also, the reminders are creepy and hilarious....Love them!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Speaking doesnt work after a time. I brought a super pack to learn effectively and I havent been able to practice speaking since 1 month. I trued all solutions given on the forum. Its useless guys, go to better apps. This app isnt what it promises. They just want to make money now and they have no customer service too in India. I mailed the bug report as well but no reply."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is awesome. They really stepped it up when they redid the app and gamified it so it's fun and motivating. I love that they have daily quests so I'm inspired to do at least 15 minutes of learning each day. I'm learning a lot and grateful for the opportunity to learn for free in a fun way.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"honestly, great. I've been using it for 37 days now & can introduce myself & order some basic meals in Japanese. I can also look at about 1/3 of Japanese characters and know how to right them out in English. I believe if I stick with it, I should be able to hold a very basic conversation by the end of the year."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,A good language learning app that helps to memorize via different senses like hearing and visualization. But I still have a suggestion.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have been using this app every day for one year. But in the last month it keeps resetting my progress. I have sent multiple bug reports to customer services but have received no response. There is no option to contact customer support directly.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I wish I could rate this app higher, but unfortunately their use of AI in translating means less culturally and socially accurate translations, which is a large part of language. Disappointing and I was looking forward to starting 2024 with a new language! I hope Duolingo decides to part ways with AI translations."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The translation in Bengali is hard coded in back end. In most of the cases while you choose the correct translation for Bengali it will show you the incorrect message and take away one heart, so you will end up with heart, which is very frustrating for a keen learner. Ihis app designed in such a nice way, that it deserves 5 star if the developer can correct this feature. Other wise it is losing its purpose."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Genuinely really enjoyable (albeit quite addictive), the difficulty increases slowly which helps builds confidence and stops it becoming overwhelming. it's important to remember that learning languages is a slow process but I feel Duolingo prompts you to actively do it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"duolingo was great untill they switched to AI course construction. Now new words do not get explained to me at all, just thrown into the course, while words I learned months ago are introduced to me like they're higher knowledge. I am also sensing a pattern where sentance structures do not make sense anymore, no human being would talk like that. Extremly dissapointing, specially since I bought super before they switched to AI. I do not wish to support a bussines that fires their employees for AI"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great tool for not only learning language but also as a game.The language learning process in the app is totally different from traditional process like starting from zero. So, I really like this part of app. Sometimes things can be a bit too much repetitive. Other than that I really like it."

Whether it's for 3 minutes a day or 15 minutes, Duolingo has become my favorite thing to do everyday! This app is very inclusive and easy to follow, I would recommend it to anyone wanted to learn a new language!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Crashes all the time. Only opens with a blank white screenand never loads. Stays blank or crashed for days. Then I have to uninstall and reinstall. And so i've always lost my streak and my place in the lessons. Nightmare!!!!!!!!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"really needs to allow section selection for which topics to learn. I'd rather learn more relevant words and sentence structure in the earlier sections like numbers, places, getting around, and general conversation instead of pets, animals, and random things about snails and wizards.."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I've been learning loads of japanese however when it's telling me to write what I hear with the hiragana atm most of the recording is cut off and i just have to guess. It would be nice if there was something which could be done so that the whole word is being said. Other than this I've had a great time but do not want to pay for a subscription yet with this bug. Thank you!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I had joined the paid subscription for the app while I had an iPhone. I switched to Motorola back in December and the charge kept pulling out. I tried to cancel on this app store but didn't get the option. I tried in the app and it informed me to do it on apple, which I didn't have access to anymore. I emailed help services a month ago for help and never got a response. I had to call apple to cancel it which was a lengthy process."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am confused. I stayed the free one then bought the Super Duolingo. I've got ads, have to get ""hearts"" and other stupid annoying things. I thought I paid not to have any of those annoyances. Was I supposed to get a different app once I paid? No idea. Would like my money back and start over"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great learning tool. App has worked flawlessly and I'm picking up this language quickly. Thank you for this! What I don't like: I doubt anyone on a crash course cares about learning how other languages abuse letters. Seriously, if a person can recognize the words as they're written and spoken, why add the spelling challenges? I'm off my soapbox now."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Personally, I use this with a class and not as my only way to learn a language, but I think it is a good tool to assist in the language learning process. However, you just recently put in a paywall for the hard lessons after you complete the main lessons. You also just laid off your staff in favor of using AI, which is both unethical and also just bad. The app will get worse because of it. That's the last straw for me."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"After using the app for a year, I understand that it may not be the best way to learn a language, but it is the only way I can do over my lunch hour. It is likely it will take more than three years of daily use of this app to finish the language course. I don't know if it will make me fluent in another language, but I am learning without paying for it. I would recommend this app, but any promises of learning a language fast are an exaggeration."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's been such a great learning experience with it. But in recent time I've noticed that it's getting bit too slow and it doesn't even show my leaderboard progress at times. Like couple of seconds before I had 400 xp now I ve 300. I dont know whats wrong but please fix it
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Hello friends today I am going to give my feedback on Duolingo. Duolingo is a free multi language learning app and it is a platform where an individual can learn any desired language from their favourite language or through their own native language. The layout and design of the app is simple and attractive. This app has a great features where you can create your own profile which shows all your progress in the current learning app. This app also shows quick studying materials those who are inte
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I had taken 2 years of Spanish in school and struggled, and I tried Rosetta Stone and another language learning app (I don't remember the name) and got nowhere. With Duolingo, I am learning so quickly! The layout is easy to use, and it goes at a great pace. I enjoyed it so much that a few months in,I paid for the full app instead of just the free version, and I have no regrets. I recommend this app to anyone interested in learning a new language. They even have a couple of film languages!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Good for beginners but useless once you get more advanced. Also, it is pushing way too much the financial and the ""game"" part. I know the gamification is a personal thing, but if it's not for you, there's no way to disable it or at least mute it somehow."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I am sorry that I gave the app a 3 but the thing is when you have 5 hearts and you run out of them, you have to do a practice lesson for EACH heart. There is a thing called Super Duolingo that for unlimited hearts and no ads and some other things too but they just want you to get it and then when your credit card payment gets declined or something like that, you have to redo the subscription. They basically want your money is just what I am saying."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo fired a ton of staff, cut away a bunch of features. Shuttered extremely helpful forums/ conversation discussions. Once year of premium is up, I'll look elsewhere. They continue to make a good product worse. Actively trying to squeeze you into something that is worse than it was every single update it seems. Check out something else for your learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"THE BEST APP to learn a language. you can learn a language for free, or get super duolingo. if you are a constant learner, you will get super duolingo for a few days with no charge. Duolingo makes learning fun, with inspirational messages and different challenges. I would definitely recommend"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app gives great practice in learning new languages, the ads aren't too intrusive, and even encourages you to do better with free premium from time to time when you perform well! Amazing app, certainly worth the cost of premium for those looking to learn a new language fast."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo's user-friendly interface and gamified approach to language learning make it a convenient choice for beginners. However, repetitive exercises may become monotonous, and its effectiveness varies. Good for casual learners, but may not suffice for mastering complex language skills."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app has always been pretty bad for teaching Korean and Japanese but recently the translations the app gives have been getting noticably worse. I heard there were layoffs and that they're replacing stuff with AI and clearly it's been decreasing the quality of the app. Absolutely not worth using.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Really love the app and it helped me with my Russian! Even if it teaches basic response, it actually helps with casual conversation. Anyway, I suggest maybe putting a dialogue (not like the ones in the app) but like a story, then we'll put what we understand in the story? This is just a suggestion!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's pretty good. Very easy to use. Am learning some basics. Will keep at it. UPDATE: I've been on it consistently over 2 years and do okay on the app but when I hear someone speaking in Spanish, I can't understand them and would not be able to converse with them."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love Duolingo so much. I'm currently learning German, and it feels like I have invested I my time the right way with the right app. I love how even if you're not on Super Duolingo, you can still learn easily and for free. However, I want to address a problem I've been facing for a while now. I can't speak on the speaking exercises. Before I even open my mouth, I am told that I'm mistaken. I make sure to speak immediately, but nothing works. I hope you guide me to a solution and help me."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,absolutely love this app. I use the the super version since I like to practice a lot and want to be able to have no limit to my mistakes - very worth the money. the free version is awesome too though. Duolingo is a staple part of my morning routine and my mission to make my screentime more productive this year
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,you see at the starting I was very excited to learn a new language but as time went by I started to get bored and because of that I couldn't complete my 7day streak I was just left with only two days but I was bored so I left it and another thing all the things are very expensive when it comes to money. Otherwise it's a good way to learn something either waisting your time on stupid games and silly videos. it mostly has all of the languages( another positive point) it's recommendedforkids
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"good leaning app, but sometimes of you leave your phone for 30sec and it switches of, the advancement in that lesson gets lost, even if you are at the last question and you have to redo a lesson from scratch. it can be very frustrating."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I actually enjoyed Duolingo and improved my knowledge. However, since they're switching to AI, I will not longer be using this app. People are irreplaceable when it comes to understanding and expressing the multitude of nuances inherent to language."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,so far so good it's fun and entertaining and the repetition is good to get practice I'm able to do these pretty fast it was able to evaluate my level of comprehension before I started which I already had some Spanish dialogue practice over decades and this is allowing me to complete sentences better and pronunciation I can read and understand Spanish easier than speak it fluently but I can speak some of the lessons back as well into my microphone
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I didnt get a notification before the free trial expiring. The app is great, unfortunately the pop-up warning me about the expiration of the free trial didnt pop up. Hugely disappointing. Unfortunately there are no refunds, as its a subscription model."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Duolingoni really perfect app for learn multiple languages and it will help you to learn an how to interact with people in any languages. Beside after every lessons the ads appears I don't like that but yeah it's good. I could have give a 5 starts but cus of ads I'll give 4 starts.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love Duolingo, only problem I've had is that, at least in the Russian course, when you need to repeat the hidden words, you can just press record and press the audio, and it bypasses you actually needing to say it. Again, no real problems Duolingo itself, just found this cheat and figured y'all should know"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Firing half your translation team and replacing them with AI is a bad move. Languages are made by people, for people. Don't cut ethical corners to save money. Deleted my account and progress, deleted the app. I suggest everyone to be doing the same. Used to be a wonderful learning app. Always appreciated the ads only being for premium instead of random apps. But I cannot support important jobs being pulled from under the feet of good, real-life people trying to make a living. AI doesn't belong."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I definatly have a lot of fun playing /learning different languages on Duolingo. However it is more competitive based and does not really explain the meaning behind the wording and vocabulary as much as i would wish for. I would still recommend this app though!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I appreciate you guys for your dedication to make learning languages fun, easier and addictive. They help me more than my language classes. I would like for you guys to add more languages like African indigenous languages. But aside from that I don't regret anything from this app. It's just what I needed. Now I'm more dedicated to learning more and more languages"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The whole aap is truly fantastic and really helpful so far ....but when I got one level up and achieved super Duolingo and tried to use the speak option the error message is thrown ...on the other hand when I'm able to use listion option it successfully works...same is happening with conversion option below the same ...I'm able to mistakes option but unable to use story option .....

They should make them less cringe. Oh and they should add a thing where you can do categorized flashcards of vocab and phrases you've already learned. 200k XP, level 7 unit 15 user, Spanish. Oh and I was really enjoying the listening exercises... Adventures with Bea and something with Oscar maybe it was, but they stop at section 7... ???"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Generally enjoying the app but as a European learning Spanish it'd be helpful if the Spanish spoken in SPAIN was accepted for all answers. The carro/coche sometimes goes through but cartera/bolso refuses to be allowed. I understand that it'd be extra work to have a specific course for Spanish Spanish rather than lumping everything into LA Spanish but someone created a Klingon course! Clearly there's enough resources to dedicate to this endeavour.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Used for almost a year streak now with over 90% accuracy. When I try to read or understand any Spanish on Youtube or Instagram from local speakers I can't understand a sentence. Duolingo uses the wors pedagogy of language teaching. They should use a conversational style with an immersive story with interesting cultural points. To start: introduce a new word or two. Then play the Spanish dialogue. Then translate it sentence by sentence 2 times. Then break it down bit by bit.Then repeat in spanish
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great learning app! But the language of Tagalog/Filipino is not an available option üò≠.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Poor UX.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it's a great tool to use along with other learning methods such as video lessons and text books. overall I'd say the premium version is worth it if you know you'll be using it everyday. if you are casually practicing here and there, save yourself the money and deal with a few ads."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The times challenges along tje path are impossible to beat without buying a power-up.this is true even early on when the words are basic. I go flawless and quick. Yet there still isn't enough time to complete them. Partly due to time and partly due to the speed of which the mew words appear. Which is slow af
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"one of the best apps.i have ever tried.Its free of cost and fun lika a game,it has many portions of learning, reading, writing, listening and speaking.But one thing I suggest to it that it should also teach the grammar of any language and to lean English you have to convert to German it's a big problem because everyone wants to learn English but not everyone has the acces to German language,so all languages should be taught in English only."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,i just loved this app‚ù§Ô∏è it's about learning languages but the problem is that it takes all the lessons so much fast atleast it much teach us one word and then give the example of the word.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo has been really amazing so far! I have managed to learn a whole new language that I have never spoken or heard of before and now I am able to have conversations with those people. The streak system that Duolingo gives also helps and gives me motivation.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Amazing app but I have a few recommendations. 1 maybe make more lives because if you just started learning a language you will make a lot of mistakes. 2 maybe make more capacity for streak freezes because 2 isn't enough for such a high price. Thank You!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is the perfect app for learning a language, it makes it easy to understand and gives you daily reminders to help.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have used Duolingo for years now and in the last few years the quality has gone down significantly, following the addition of so many AI generated lessons. Human translators and human labor is necessary for this kind of product, and laying off real people in favor of making the app actively worse in the process is horrific. AI cannot accurately understand the nuances of human language, let alone translation, and it is disappointing to see Duolingo choose it over real people."

I really recommend to anyone wanting to learn languages.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The sentences that you learn on duolingo are completely useless most of the time.

I like it a lot, and would recommend to anyone learning a language for the first time, or that is just in need of a rainy day activity."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good for learning the basics, lots of cute rewards. you have to guess at the grammar and really observe the syntax if you want great scores. It doesn't explain different usage for the same word, but spelled differently."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I think that duolingo is a great way to learn, and my kids' Hebrew school uses the classroom feature, and my daughter can learn the material efficiently. She does have a samsung and is waiting for the music update to come out, but that is the slightest of issues."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really like this app for learning a new language, its really simple to use. The only thing i think they vould add is a music feature, where it would teach you how to sing your favorite songs in different languages. Mostly on how to say the words to the song and what they mean."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a great app. My parents and I started learning daily. That's why I put 4 stars but, There are some mistakes sometimes for Japanese and often sentences are correct but considered wrong. Sounds missing and not resolved despite tickets to arrange. Always room for improvement"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pros: great app to start learning a language; decent free content; good listening practice; game mechanics enforcing studies; nice design and humor; helpful user support Cons: expensive subscription; almost no grammar, find it elsewhere (books/googling mandatory); limited number of examples; can freeze while you speak not recognizing a single word, so timed challenges are pathetic; poor game currency design leading to accidental spending in timed exercises so you constantly lose it for nothing"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Amazingly wonderful app makes learning so exciting and easy. lesson content is good and are structured path for sustainable learning experience. I would like to thank duo team for all the hard work in making language learning so easy... I would suggest team to put some video content on pronunciation which are different and more information on language along with exercise.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Was happily using the app. Got a free 3 day trial for 'Super'. Then I couldn't do the next lesson with creating a profile, so I did and lost all my progress andy streak. I can't be bothered to do the same lessons again."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"My friend told me that duolingo is the best app to learn new languages.. So i downloaded it to see for myself.. Well it's a great app to learn new languages!! I am personally learning Japanese language and it's helping a lot with explaining each word, pronunciation, alphabet pronunciation and writing and more!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I play every day and it does help learning Spanish but I'm not rating higher until they fix match madness. There's not enough time to complete the higher levels. Only there for a cash grab so people buy time extensions. Increase the time or decrease the number of pairs needed. Otherwise you are just worthless human beings.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The app is very learning full. I like that a lot. and it's fun to learn. hard languages are just a game and I am learning Korean and that is not hard like I have heard at. and Duolingo always start from base. whole Frist level was at the base and teaching me single words.And it is a very good thing for beginners. and I am just love with this app. and the character on thumbnail is very cute. and his name is super cute duo. you can customise your own profile and that's a very good thing.thank you
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,its been 1-2 weeks since I'm learning my new language....i would like to say it that everything is so well designed and understandable....that even a kid can learn from it ...I've always wanted to learn a new language but I've never been able to find a good platform to learn it.. .since most of the apps are paid thats also out of my convince....but since i found duo lingo its been such a great experience...like a dream came true moment...i really appreciate everyone who are part of creating it!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's so good and useful ... I only gave 4 Stars because of one thing ... I'm Persian so my native language isn't English but i can use English so i can use Duolingo too ... But whenever I want to recommend the app to other people it becomes a problem, for example i told my friends and aunt to download it but then again they can't use it cuz they're not comfortable with English ... It would be wonderful if Persian was one of the languages you could choose to learn other languages with ..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,the app locks you into these time consuming typing heavy exercises. these exercises should be half as long. you can do more if you want but having these very long exercises makes you drop out half way through because too much time is required. this means you can only play this if you have a lot of free time.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Been using the app for the last 5 yrs. The crrator likes to play games with us. Its the last day of the week, and you are 1000 or more ahead of the others, but you don't get the usual chests for studying morning and evening (before 12 AM and after 6 PM). Then, while you are learning, you see suddenly that a trailing player did over 4000 in the last half an hour. Also, they state that when you correct your previous mistakes , while on a double XP spell, you would get 40 XPs, but you only get 20!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very good way to learn and practice a language, but they often remove useful features like comments to problems. Feels like they try to minimize communication between students, which is very weird considering it is an app to learn languages..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it's a really good platform to learn new languages not I am just finished with it and I am thinking to learn Korean as well. the best thing I love about it when I was using it and after a week it gave me this opinion to rate it, if there would be other app they would be sending notifications to rate them every time üò´ But thanks to Duolingo ü¶âit never irritated me like that and teach me so nicely ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a great app you can learn different languages and it's really fun. I would've given it a 5 star review it's just that it expects you to be on it everyday then resets you if you miss a day but rather than that it's an awesome app that motivates you to reach your goal. 4 stars
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,a little glitchy. the ipad app doesn't sync up to the phone one very well and you'll occasionally watch ads for rewards in the game that don't get credited. it's helpful but hard to make mistakes without paying for the premium version
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is solid for learning vocabulary and sentence structure, and is a good language tool if you don't go in expecting to spend 5 minutes a day and eventually become fluent - nothing is going to replace using the language to earn fluency. That said, they recently laid off a huge number of their staff and replaced them with AI, which shows they don't care about their employees or, given the way current language models work, the quality of their product for customers."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app is great and I originally gave it five stars but I'm changing my rating to a single star simply because the advertisements are so terrible and aggressively distracting that it almost makes it worthless. The ads are so offensive that it makes it hard to want to pay for the service at all.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm really disheartened to see Duolingo's recent mass layoffs of translators. It's made me lose any good faith I had left, given how the quality of learning on this app has been declining for months now. I've been using Duolingo daily for over a year and this just isn't a good way to learn a language. The disregard Duolingo has for its staff is appalling."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a great product but they have some problems. For example, you may be asked to translate a sentence from the foreign language to English like ""I am going shopping with my mom at the mall"" and it will mark it wrong because you put ""I am going shopping at the mall with my mom"". The two sentences have an identical meaning since in English the prepositional phrases can be transposed so they are valid. It is like they know the foreign language but are clueless about English."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love using this app to refresh what I learned in high school! It helps to constantly hear and speak the languages! I woukd like to see more activites where we have to conjugate verbs and where we could possibly match the verbs in different tenses. ü§∑
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like this app very much I am laerning french and it is helping me like a language teacher. This is like a game and free language learning app you can make gems and streak here and this also guide you in our previous mistakes . It is add free too and we can learn many languages after completing a language course we can also apply dor another course. It can be used for translation,in tour purposes when you have to learn languages of another countries and you can also use it for talking too."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It's a good app to learn languages. But with the ads and then only getting 5 hearts and barely any diamonds in the chest so you can barely ever refill your hearts is annoying. Why punish me for making mistakes? And when you run out of hearts and have no diamonds or any ads to watch you CANNOT practice. You can buy a monthly thing for 6.99 but omg it's annoying. I'm trying to learn and you punish me for making a single mistake. That's a flawed and annoying system. 2 out of 5.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My dad has a girlfriend who is a refugee from Ukraine and this app has helped her and her daughter learn English so much! I am learning Ukrainian to make an effort to communicate with them instead of forcing them to learn everything in English. The one and only problem I have is that it doesn't register your voice a lot, making you fail one of the questions. But, overall, A very good app, would recommend!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"There is one real reason why it's not five stars. I'm English, learning french. Annoyingly ""English"" is American English, which actually causes some issues. E.g. I say Autumn, the French say Automne. Pretty similar. When it asks me to translate the American ""Fall"" my brain thinks it is the action of falling every time and I get it wrong. Or ""book"" (AE) - ""reserver"". In English we say reserve. So when it asks me to translate ""book"" I think ""lire"" and again, get it wrong. Besides that, love it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I like the app. It's not boring but challenging)) But. I'm not sure about other leaners but as for me I'd prefer to have an option to see all the words and phrases used in the passed lessons. Some kind of a dictionary of the words I'm supposed to know.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I just canceled my super subscription and uninstalled. Will not support a company that is letting people go in favor of using AI. The point of learning a new language is to communicate with other people; I want to know that the training I'm being given was developed by live human beings. When you get something wrong it usually doesn't tell you why. New lessons have no explanation. Example sentences are often nonsensical (cat being a waiter?!) and clearly written by a bot.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I think this is the best learning app. I love the steak thing and the avatar changer! 4 stars because it makes me know how to speak different accents. BUT it have problems. I answered correctly but it says wrong. Please duolingo fix it!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is a great app plagued by ads. There is a lot great features hidden behind a pay wall. Personally I don't think the subscription is worth it but to each their own. Great app with cool features but too many ads and pay walls.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I don't understand what the difference between ""Une"" and ""un"" in French, because last time I put ""an"" it's une and now une is a. I'm on unit 2, and when I scroll back up to unit 1, it comes up with a challenge with 2 minutes, I can't do 2 minutes, and I panic. Still a good game, though. üëç"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I learnt Japanese very well with duo. It's fun learning languages with duolingo. I really liked this application. It's for free also no subscription required for lerning simply. I gave Four stars for showing adds. Although It's best experiance with duo.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm having fun while learning. If I fail a challenge, I can come back with a fresh mind later on and retry. I enjoy learning through mistakes which is really the easiest way to get the hang of what not to do. Truly the Soulsborne of learning a language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Loving learning German at my own pace. it's a great resource. It's such a clever platform with incentives along the way. Very user friendly. will do other languages eventually. great to do individually or compete with friends.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I liked it better before the latest change. I felt that i was learning more through repetition and i dont like being forced to progress. Update: 1/26/24 I can say this app is one of the top 3 decisions of my life. I can also say the obvious, that Google puts way too much effort into trying to control the way we think and feel. Learning a language should not be political. App is way too woke. From 4 down to 3 stars."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"overall app is nice, but I don't agree with some of the content in the stories. I have a 5 year old daughter and 7 year old son and it's not right that in an app to learn a language they should be exposed to stories of lesbian couples meeting their loved ones family and newlyweds going on a honeymoon. pretty disturbing imo"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is a good app, I don't want anyone to think otherwise. The reason my rating is a 3 is because I'm learning Korean for my wife, and the speech part is very unclear. She can't even hear the speech differences between phrases, and one pronunciation sounds straight up like electronic noise. I'm still learning a lot, but I think I'm still going to have a hard time saying things unless my wife tells me what it really is meant to sound like."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is so much fun and the way language is presented is easy to learn from. I'm glad it's free with ads. but I'm probably going to spring for the super Duolingo version without ads and unlimited hearts. with even just a few minutes a day I'm able to learn
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Was enjoying until they started implementing ai and dropping human translators. I've lost all faith in the accuracy of translations since. I've done a bit of translating, so the fact that this is passing through the language-inator 3000 rather than a human interpreter who can do the surprisingly tricky work of finding an accurate and workable translation really undermines my confidence. When given the options between a guy with a dictionary and a translation model, I'm picking the guy every time"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It works! I mean its method of teaching languages is super effective. it succeeds in training you to understand and speak a new language. and it's effective particularly by hacking your human psychology and hooking you in your process of learning. This makes for one of the few times that I'm grateful for my mind having been hacked and hooked by an app. Thank you for this!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Every thing is nice, it's friendly and exciting interface, solving questions and tasks, growing up levels everything. But there is limited languages of INDIA, I want to learn *TAMIL* and *TELUGU*, But there is no language to learn. But I am happy that there interface to language through these languages."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I really love this app‚ù§‚ù§. This really helps me to understand and speak other languages and in one day I can learn alot of words. Also it has really cool features its really amazing! It really helps me with my schoolwork and homework this is the best Spanish app ever!! Keep up the good work Doulingo!!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Learning a new language on Duolingo is super fun as the app is very user friendly making the learning experience an awesome one. I'd highly recommend Duolingo for someone that wants to exercise consistency by challenging yourself daily and having fun as you learn :), get the app today and start learning üòä"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"A fun game to learn words but not viable to learn a language. I knocked the leagues off weeks ago as repeating ""my shoes are small"" or ""the wolf speaks with him"" for the sake of gaining experience for competition got repetitive. I'm on 114 day streak and not motivated further to keep using this app as despite 30mins a day practicing, nothing I'm learning is practical or useful for day to day conversation. With this in mind I'm disappointed I paid for the super version."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I can read hiragana and katakana. so that's good. but I also learned hiragana in one day 7 years ago by looking at a chart so I'm a little different than most people. I should mention that doesnt mean I know what the words mean. However I can say that without this I wouldn't have learned katakana or really anything else. I end every lesson in under 1 minute with 88% being the lowest. if you do want to learn another language easily this is probably the best way to get started and have a routine.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Had a 300+ day streak, but im breaking it and leaving this app permanently. If I wanted duolingo staff laid off in favor of ai translating, I'd use google translate. So unbelievably disappointing, I've rode w this app for years. Ig its time to put it down and get serious with something that has actual credentials in language learning, not a worthless translation bot. I hope your empire crumbles. ü´°"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"A new year and now more aggressive and longer marketing ads which appear to be designed to push me into paying Duolingo time. That seems counter to their underlying goals stated up front. After a full year streak, it's time to pay up or move on to something else. I am now much more inclined to let Duolingo go because I do not like the sense of coercion and manipulation these new hard-sell tactics are directed towards."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a great way to spend time productively and learn something new, but I would have liked it more if there weren't as many notifications or things that can be obtained by watching ads. I really have to appreciate the learning courses though they're good üëç"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to be excellent, now you get penalised for making mistakes which prevents further learning. Plenty of ads. Hearts replenish at a rate slower than most ice ages meaning learning is further hampered for free users. Edit: Over a year on and no contact from the devs, clearly they don't care and are focused on revenue. American English focused."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They recently laid off a huge percentage of their translators cuz ~AI is cheaper~, remaining staff will only be kept around to review what the AI is putting out. So. Do NOT use this app anymore if you're leaning for work, as the translations have a significantly higher likelihood of being terribly incorrect/ colloquially out of date now."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy this app, however beed this to be fixed. This has a bug in the time limit challenge. When I reach the 14th question screen dims and all haptic points on the app does not work, looks like an overlay. This happened twice, I have lost 100 points, twice."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's fun for a ""free"" app but the speaking tests are broken and I've sent countless bug reports but I think I'm wasting my time. Press ""tap to speak"" and it immediately fails you without giving you a chance to speak. Also, teaches you phrases like ""beer and bread"" before ""i am,"" ""my name is,"" ""how are you,"" etc. or other basics like the alphabet or numbers, days, months, etc. Finally, if you're going to switch to AI so you don't have to pay humans to do the work, you can calm tf down on the ads?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I initially found this good but as it gets more in depth, there are many grammatical errors in both languages. Plus it will do things like mark you incorrect for something, then two exercises later, reverse that teaching. So annoying."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is really enjoyable and fun to use. But if there is anything to improve on, it would be to allow accessibility for the users to change their profile picture instead of having to choose a profile icon made by Duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,There is an issue with options being unresponsive. This makes it difficult to complete the lessons.Can this be fixed please? Spending time and hearts being stuck and after numerous updates on issue there has been no improvement or even an acknowledgement.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,70% of the time I am not able to listen to the audio of the things they are saying.. I came on this platform after a while but it's features have changed a lot .. and this sound glitch is awful. Hope this sound glitch gets fixed soon. üôÇ
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm getting frustrated with the lack of explanation and support. They used to have a forum for each question, and even when discussions were locked you could at least read what other people were asking. If I was confused about grammar, I could look to see what other learners were saying. Now I have to either try and find the information elsewhere or have gaps in my knowledge. And good luck if you're not learning a popular language! Edit: They use primarily AI for translation now. DO NOT BUY."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Cancelling my super subscription and rating 1 star after hearing of Duolingo's decision to fire many of their human staff to replace with AI. Aside from the economic impact on these people, and the downright disgusting practice of using AI to cut corners, an algorithm cannot understand a language in the way a human can, and this app WILL suffer in quality as a result of this decision. I have always had great respect for Duolingo as an accessible language learning app, and I'm very disappointed."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a great app and I enjoyed learning a new language for the first week. Some of my gems were used for something I didn't select so I contacted support. A stupid ""agent"", Jeremy Jock, took it upon themselves to ""help"" me by cancelling my annual subscription. I requested that thia be reversed, then sent a further email a week later, but I've not received any response besides a form to complete to rate Jeremy's service. I've not received my refund and I'm put off this app entirely."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The last update made the Latin lessons more perfect. But the recorded human voices don't differentiate short vowels from long vowels. For example, the word 'garum', a in ga must be short, but the voice utters as if it was a long vowel. I suggest that the macrons should be utilized in the next update."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Yk I've felt always inferior my whole life. Being good at nothing. So I start distancing myself. Sleepless nights of studying with nosebleeds and fatigue. Still not good enough. I found this app and thought it was fun. I played everyday for at least 30 mins. And yesterday I was top 1. I felt happy and slept. The next day I wake to find I was placed second. I'll never be first. I'll always come second to the ones who do things in the last minute.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy using Duolingo for learning new languages. But recently I'm facing issue while using the app, it only works on Wi-Fi and I'm not able to use app on mobile data. Please resolve this issue. I've tried reinstalling, it doesn't work too either."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have several language apps. I really like Duolingo because it covers all of the language learning: reading, writing, listening, and speaking. I find myself using this app above the others. The trick is, you get what you put in. Don't forget to take advantage of all the support Duolingo has to offer."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is the best free app I've ever used. Yes it is educational, not necessarily for entertainment, but they gamify it so it's still fun to learn a new language. Also very easy to use without spending any money. But I think it would be worth the money anyway - just haven't made the invested as of yet."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"UPDATED REVIEW. Could use more explanations of grammar rules. Some languages (especially Japanese) are only good to learn phrases, as they don't teach you the how's and why's of the grammar. EDIT: Duolingo is now using AI for it's practices, making this service completely unreliable and useless. Uninstalling immediately."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It was great and I pay for SuperDuolingo. However the courses have been awful lately. They don't make sense. Then I found out they are using AI instead. If this continues I am canceling and deleting the app. How is an AI suppose to teach me? I have used Google translate it is awful. Bring back your real staff who actually speak the language!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's a great way of learning Japanese. But there are minor problems with the app and more serious ones with the website. The problems get fixed eventually, then the course is restructured and more problems appear. Edit 02/24. App keeps crashing so I'm ready to give up. Duolingo have never answered one of my emails. If they don't answer before I pay for it why would they bother after getting my money?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"this app is amazing even without premium. it's easy and fun, and the set up of the app makes it more of a game and it gets you excited to learn. there are so many languages to choose from and the ads are short and they don't occur that often. I absolutely recommend!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm actually learning English on the app. I was on the 4th chapter. I wanted to see how hard it would be on the 9th so i took a test for it (thinking that would be impossible for me to get it). Strangely I've gotten it. It wasn't hard enough, so easy (like choose the right answer). And now I want to turn back on the 4th, impossible. Please, would anybody help me or give me an advice..üôè"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is the best language learning app. I like the new update. But some changes I do not like. I liked the old dark blue colour for the legendary trophy and old shape of the trophy too. Can you add a chatting space to chat with our duolingo friends.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app, but I wish they brought back the community button. Not only could I find user corrections that were more applicable but also answers that were more complex. Some comments were also quite funny. Now, it feels sort of bland, and when stuck on understanding, there are no alternatives."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Although the paid version of duolingo provides more ways to practice and improve on your mistakes, the free version really does help learn a new language. Totally recommend the widgets to add on your home screen to keep your streak going"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Hindi course does not have Speaking Exercises that they claim to have. This Setting is Toggled ON, but it does not work. I have contacted Duolingo twice about this issue. Yet, no response from Duolingo. I am paying for the Super Duolingo subscription and I wholeheartedly am sad about this situation. Refund requested please."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,User interface is fine but no real learning advancement if you want more than the absolute basics. Hope you enjoy seeing the same 5 words over and over and over. And it's gotten worse since they fired all the staff and use all AI now.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Basically Duolingo is a very good app for language learning. I am using this for about 4 months. The only issue I wanna mention is that please increase the amount of XP per game as it's hard for normal user in higher league like obsidian and diamond for competing with the people who have taken super subscription.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Originally I used duolingo a lot. However over time they changed it a lot. I'm not sure if I don't like it because I'm used to how it was 3-4 years ago vs how it is now, or because I just feel I'm having a harder time learning, while it is becoming more and more a videogame. Even though it is true that it always had that ""gaming"" component, nowadays it feels like it is more a game than a learning tool."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Super easy learning and is repetitive so that what you're learning sinks in. and it incorporates what you have learned into the new leasons so that it all stays fresh in your mind so that you don't forget what you learned in previous lessons and units.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Excellent App for learning. Really enjoyable education journey. However, Apple App seems to have better functionality than Android. My partner can move words in responses on his iPhone, and I am not able to do this on my Samsung. Please fix it, Duolingo:-)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Random background music keeps playing in the app constantly. It interferes with the lessons making it hard to hear a sentence. Worst part is I didn't find any option to turn off the music.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo keeps me working at it. I like that the lessons are short and the streak freeze gives me the incentive to not miss any days out. I subscribed to Super Duolingo and it seems to be impossible to stop the subscription of this!!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"such a great app to use if you want to learn another language in a fun way. Duolingo opens up new opportunities for a wider and broader knowledge about a specific language. Whether it is for work, school, travel or plainly just to feed your boring time, Duolingo is such a life saver."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,volume of ads is so much louder than the lessons. it's jarring. having to quickly try to mute every ad is annoying. please add a setting that keeps the ads muted or lower the volume on ads because it's just way to loud in comparison to the lessons.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Over the last few years they have removed a lot of helpful features such as interactive grammar boards, events, and have recently laid off human translators in favor of AI. There is a continual problem of people somehow gaming the points system to get to the top of leader boards. Quality has seriously degraded."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,absolutely five stars. this app is great. I took French in school elementary and Junior high and this brings me back to the basics this app starts elementary but quickly progresses along with your cooperation and success in the challenges. I've already forwarded the link to several of my family and friends.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like using the app, but it could move on a bit quicker to advance me faster. I would like it to require me to build senyences completely on my own and then correct my mistakes afterward, rather than giving me the vocabulary up front."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This app was one of my favourites but what on earth is this new update? I can't practice old lessons anymore? Update*** app improved last year and new lesson structure added more lessons to the Irish language course. As of yesterday (31/1/2024) the app now doesn't work correctly with the gboard keyboard. PLEASE FIX!!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What happened to this app?! Why subscriptions?! Just give us the option to buy a lifetime without subscription services. Another thing that I don't like about Duolingo is that, the developer removed the comments from the Duolingo community in the app. I felt that it was very helpful explaining why or how to speak in a particular way of a language. The developer should bring back the comments and get rid of the subscriptions."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am currently learning Japanese and no doubt I am having fun with Duolingo. It's just amazing as I am having fun learning with great enthusiasm There is no black spot in learning as it provides us with the pronunciation, the spelling and writting. Also, the streak series keeps me alive and it contributes in my interest in learning"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"App is good. But I am learning stupid unuseful words and phrases. Let's imagine I am a tourist, or refugee, whatever. Why should I care about ""strange animal""? I need most used and common words. Also I have to spend too much time on same words. Those are main reasons why I don't want to pay for it. As an option - make it possible to pick topics. I am tired of learning animals and don't need it at all."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It used to be ok, but it's getting worse and they're removing useful features like the forums which were the only way to actually make sense of what they are teaching. The Japanese course is very bad and reported mistakes never get corrected after years."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like it but it's the same lesson for a week, I can't remember stuff that well, but I wish it had an option to stay or move on, therefore the app will help you longer instead of waiting for you to get on the level so you take forever trying to learn that language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a really fun and easy way tolearn a language. It uses actual sciencey techniques to teach you and helps you to understand how the language works with its handy guidebook. I kinda wish the Super Duolingo adverts didn't crop up as much, but it's still amazingly good."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Somehow there already was a 5 star review by me that said ""makes learning fun"" that I know for a fact I DID NOT write. It's free so you get what you pay for. ""Quirky"" sentences about horses buying groceries aren't going to help you become fluent. A LOT of the English translations are clunky/wrong. Incredibly inconsistent. A missing letter might cost you a heart, sometimes not. It is CONSTANTLY asking you to spend your coins on stupid stuff like earning double points."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"great app, one small issue, the speaking questions sometimes won't pick up only one specific word even if i pronounce it exactly like the preview and yes, my mic is great since it doesn't pick only a selected word, this results into not getting perfect lesson over some stupid bug"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love being able to learn a new language and how it's constantly changing (even if i get thrown forward or back sometimes). Dislike how incredibly laggy, buggy, and slow the app can be sometimes."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoy Duolingo. I'm currently working on Japanese. One thing though, I would prefer to choose when I'm ready to get rid of romanji. I'm learning the vocab faster than I'm learning to read the characters (I have other things I'm using to support this) but I'm kind of at a standstill in my vocab lessons because I still rely heavily on romaji and duo is deciding to take this away now"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It often does not explain the rules, just gives examples, and you are left to guess when to use certain words, or how to conjugate different herbs for different tenses. I've been doing it over a year, and still can't get my brain to learn in this way."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"- New learning path doesn't make sense and occcassionaly just moves you to somewhere else, leading to a decreased feeling of accomplishment - Searching for the right word between 20 tiny boxes is very frustrating, especially because sometimes they phrase concepts in different ways.

Since recently, every Chest returns 2x XP, instead of Diamonds, even while one or more 2x are already active. Either it should be Diamonds or at least 2x that can be used later. How much ever we love the App, we cannot keep using it for hours together at one stretch!? 03-Jun-21: 5 Stars - What a way to learn !!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I got this app years ago to review the language I studied in college, but I haven't opened it in ages because they made it so you couldn't jump around lessons. With the news about AI translations, I've been reminded to uninstall it from my phone. The company gradually ruined a great app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I am happy with Duolingo but my only criticism is the speech detection is not brilliant either not picking up words or saying I have prouncated a word correctly when I have not. But still recommend it, just keep that in mind when using this app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Doulingo is such a good app!! You can learn a lot of languages to communicate with family and friends who speak a different language. It might be a bit weird of sentences, but you never know what you might need to say. Overall, I really like the app, and that's just my opinion and thoughts. Thank you for your time!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great App! One of the best language learning apps I've ever used; only complaint is that the speaking exercises will mark you wrong sometimes, even when you're saying a phrase correctly and have your phone close to your face."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The pace is whatever you make it! I enjoy the characters & animation too. One other aspect I wasn't expecting but really appreciate is the part in a lesson that asks you to speak the phrase in Spanish! Definitely worth your time if you have ANY interest in learning another language :)
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is great! Thanks to him and his friends, I learnt perfect Spanish. The only thing which is a problem is how they keep reminding you, Duolingo Is Bored!!! Which is okay, but kinda annoying. Besides that, It's The BEST. Recommended!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"awsome! I'm learning Japanese. The app keeps things simple and fun with goals to motivate you and keep you on track. I also appreciate that previous lessons are repeated often, then built upon incrementally to enable retention."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo uses a variety of techniques to help learners comprehend the meaning of their words rather than relying solely on mindless parroting phrases back and forth. Another aspect to appeal to a wider range of users is the gaming format which users can follow or ignore at their own discretion however Duolingo has no customer service contact or interaction whatsoever so if there is a glitch you will break your streaks, lose points, not be able to submit a heads up to the company or receive help"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very nice app you can actually learn any language you choose but you need to find a way to practice it daily at the same time to learn it easier....maybe one of the few apps that worth buying the premium version....I hope they will not change it much in the future....
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My family absolutely love Duolingo! I have always wanted to learn Japanese but didn't think that I was capable, Duolingo had proved me wrong! My youngest has taken on Welsh and is top of his league just today after a hard 37-day streak. The way that the learning process is designed has kept him completely motivated and engaged. Amazing üëè ü§©"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It was great at first but I have been unable to progress in 2 months due to an error in the lesson. I've reached out and submitted multiple error reports with no resolution or response. Extremely frustrating.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am currently learning basic speaking and listening japanese, so i have Romanised mode enabled. I have no intention of learning to read/write using duolingo. The new update forces questions about reading, with no romanised characters, which means i cannot complete lessons as i keep running out of lives due to being forced reading questions with no romanised text."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"2023: One of the only apps I would recommend paying for, only because I don't like watching ads or being restricted by hearts. I have definitely learned a lot of words and ways to express myself. My biggest gripe is that the discussions are all locked because people thought they knew better and complained, instead of using the constructive space. 2024: Taking off another star because although I'm a paying customer, Duo doesn't feel it's important enough to phase Math over to Android yet. LAME!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Down goes my usual 5 star review. About 4/5 times this month, this app keeps giving me the ""speak 7 times in lessons"" quest, but not a single talking activity in lessons. Impossible quest. On top of that, I frequently get huge ones like ""get 90% in 5 lessons"". That's way too much. I'm learning here, not grinding tests. I couldn't find any way in-app to give feedback, so this stays here until I get a response."

Now I'm not sure I want to continue because it might be teaching poor pronunciation =<"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Improved my english with the duolingo to a good extent. Only disappointment is that it doesn't level up with the difficulty even after I have got nearly 50,000 points. So it frustrates me to do practice things I know very well."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"They keep updating the coursework so while you don't lose your streak, your placement changes. Also they didn't renew a bunch of their translators' employment contracts in favor of using AI. So gone down hill a bit. Will not consider getting Super Duolingo. Why pay for something AI makes?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Has engaging elements, which is good because it helps keep you on track.. It can get a bit cringy with the characters at times, though. I know it's to appeal to my generation, but sometimes it feels desperate. Maybe if it was toned down a tad, it wouldn't be much of a problem."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app actually does a great job at teaching you different languages, from simply learning the basics, to learning more advanced stuff, or phrases that can be used often daily. Perfect for beginners. Thank you Duolingo for teaching me more Spanish!!! :)üëçüëç"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is a fun learning path that guides you to knowing languages better but not fluently. But still, this is a very good recommendation for people who struggle with learning a language. And there is also math and music on Apple, also recommended for people."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,In my opinion this isn't good for learning when using it for free. Super Duolingo is A big booster when it comes to learning. Without Super you need to do more reveiwing and is good for helping remeber a language rather than learning a new 1. If It went on sale more instead of 1 time every year it qould be nice.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's cute, and mostly works. However, there are differences between Portuguese in Portugal and Portuguese in Brazil that should be addressed. My Portuguese will be bad enough without introducing unnecessary errors."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really like this app! If you really want to learn a language I recommend using Duolingo..Duolingo makes learning languages a fun experience.! As a person with ADHD,who finds it hard to commit to things..It's very easy for me to learn languages.."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Far too strict on spelling and far too many useless or obscure words thrown at you to give this more than 3 stars. After more time it's clear this app is less for teaching you a language and more about scamming you out of hearts in a pathetic attempt to monetise your time. Never explains any grammar rules, just marks as wrong. Never explains idioms or phases, just leaves it in a confusing manner. Likes to translate words in the most odd way. Also now fails to register a completed lesson often."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Lately the app sometimes doesn't register a lesson if it's started by a notification (that's my impression) even if then the app seems to be counting the day correctly. On the day after, the app shows a streak freeze has been used instead."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Duolingo does help you with learning words that you will use daily. I find it very helpful assisting me with learning a new language. And nowadays they totally force yourself you to get super with the hearts system. They show you the benefits to getting super way too much.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"the translations it teaches have become lower quality. it's vietnamese course is pretty low quality because of that. a > b does not teach any context so I find many people cannot understand until I show them a screenshot. then they say ""yeah, no one uses those words anymore"" still a decent way to build vocab but not helpful in understanding parts of the language. some languages are better than others though."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Don't waste your time. According to this app I am a ""world champion"" who has won the Diamond league tournament and who scores in the top 0.2 percent of users. That should make me something like a DuoLingo star, right? Well, I am walking away from this intensely boring, repetitive app that, even though I have long ago finished every lesson in my chosen language (doing only reviews now for way too long), I cannot understand, read, or speak it. This rapidly devolves into the grindiest of ""games"""
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Pushes the premium subscription to the point that I now believe that they purposefully use incorrect audio (or just terrible AI) to get you to spend money. I'm reporting more incorrect questions by the day. They use shortened informal sentences but do not accept the same statement as a correct answer. Listening to the regular vs slow speed is the only way to catch their omitted words. You'll never see a dime from me Duolingo till you focus on quality over profits.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"3 weeks on, I'm anjoying the basics. So far the only problem I have is the constant Woke propaganda. It would be nice to learn a language without having politics push down your throat. I wouldn't recommend this to children. 2 months update. It's getting worse. There are many mistaken english phrases. I heard its done by AI. That makes sense now."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Would give this 4 stars if it weren't for the progressive agenda constantly being pushed. Definitely won't ever have my kids use this as they learn about the large families the two dads have. Even without the system's agenda being pushed, I still wouldn't give it 5 stars. If you get an answer wrong on something you haven't yet been taught in their curriculum, you still lose a heart. You're just supposed figure it out ahead of time & memorize it through repetition with zero explanations yet."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app now has an excessive amount of long ads. Between that and the introduction of 5 hearts (5 mistakes allowed total, but you can purchase more), the developers are just greedy. Some slides are woke now, too. ""He loves his husband."" Can I learn a language without that kind of garbage?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The amount of errors that are on here is increasing You are losing people based on the set up of this app. In lesson notes, conjugations need to be there and I suggest a vocabulary section with all of the words that I have learned so far to practice. Babbel is holding a competitive edge over you. Without changes, I will not buy premium again"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Doesn't ever explain WHY you should use particular verb endings. There are way too many ads. It is too expensive for the paid version. Very slow and impractical progress. Uses woke examples, trying to force its godless, anti-Christian lesbian views."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have been using the free app. The app keeps track of the number of days you have participated. There have been three days, in recent months, that the app would not load. There is no way to report this, so your streak is broken. Frustrating!

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a great way to learn words and phrases. however, to actually fully understand and learn a language you are going to have to find humans to speak it to and learn how to converse as well as immerse yourself in the language through books, video games, and movies to truly understand. I don't think you could actually learn a language entirely through this app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love this app and it helps me learn new languages but the one thing I wish they would add is a way to stop doing the league thing. Somedays I'm just really busy and don't have time to earn all that xp and when u don't I ret sent down. I'm just wondering if they could have a no league option.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Real speakers have been replaced with AI voices with incorrect, unnatural pronunciation. The exercises have also become extremely repetitive. I've maintained a daily streak for several years but am considering quitting the app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo has recently let a large portion of its workforce go in favor of using AI to create its content. If Duolingo has decided that it's users are not worth the care and knowledge that real native speakers had been putting into their lessons until now, then I have no reason to continue using it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Japanese needs a way to learn Kanji more on our choice. Japanese gets too hard and slow to read without kanji. Every new word should be learnable as kanji if we choose to do so. (If it has a kanji obviously). Not the current slow way by lesson and unit. Also many words we already learn the kanji ages ago and in a different word it goes back to plain hiragana instead of using the kanji we already learned.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Way too much repeating of the same words. They are a fraud! They said that they would notify me before the trial period ended so I could cancel the $80+ annual fee. They didn't and I was charged $90, more than I agreed to Added some secret fee."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The best way to learn any language is by practice. instead of learning the rules of grammar which is kinda boring, Duolingo does a great job of teaching you that in a more natural way. it allows you to practice in different ways. It also teaches you how to spell, pronounce, and translate. Amazing!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm not learning much. No intro sentences or activities. I'm still learning how to say ""Pizza Please"" after 250+ days, come on Duo! Duo better! Great for figuring out if you even want to learn a language, other than that it's... I have no idea because I still don't know a common word like trash in Japanese to call Duo trash in japanese. But if you need pizza from a convenience store, and a sushi and a boom, I'm your man."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Despite the language lesson it offers, Duolingo is rigid when it comes to flexibility of teaching and accepting the answer(they only wanted the RIGHT answers, which is according to them and not by you) , and this weakness is really frustrating to me, disappointed üò•. Otherwise its a good learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's a nice languange learning app. Though, I wish that you'l focus on the writing aspect. Maybe have us write without the guidelines and tell whats wrong.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What used to be a great and easy educational program has been changed into a gaming format that focuses more on playing than learning. If you want silly games, get Candy Crush. If you want to learn a language, look elsewhere."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a fun way to learn languages, there's even an option to send corrections if you encounter some (found 1). I like that it's interactive not only in terms of games, but also this improvement option."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's good for an introduction, however it's a tad too easy... It doesn't exactly know how to explain rules more complicated than just words and verbs... it also glitches out if the app isn't active for more than 10 seconds, so be fast. And if you don't start your lesson at least 20 minutes before the deadline, you may run into complications where they force you to stop the lesson if you don't pay money and you'll have to do a different lesson to get your daily lesson in"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is great. So far I've only used it to relearn a language I once knew but had forgotten, but it does build you up from the ground. I fear if I was to learn a non Germanic language like Russian, it won't teach you the Cyrillic alphabet or how to use it, but it will teach you to speak it in enough situations that you could get by in that country"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Good app with great incentives to learn regularly. Unfortunately the new update introduced background music which plays over everything and cannot be turned off. Destroys the experience.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Recent lessons have been filled with bad translations. I thought, lol, this feels like AI wrote it. Turns out it did. Duolingo replaced their human translation team last month. Language is about connotation and nuance. I'm not interested in learning to talk like a robot that doesn't understand any of that. Bring back your human translators and get rid of AI and I'll update this review."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Started Duolingo and to my surprise they're using bots to compete with you. Guess they want to keep competitive so you spend more time in the app for some reason. My experience: The leaderboard was in the range of 500/600. I spend a long time and grinded until 1900. Then a profile, without any pic got ahead me. I checked the profile: joined duolingo in 1970!? Lol and it did not have any day streak. Checked the profile again, it is private. They'll blame this on epoch time, that's not the case"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Can't learn a full language but it can be a little helpful. Since they fired most of their staff and moved to AI there are lots of problems. You will see the same word used for several other words with no explanation as to why or when to use it properly. They have also removed the discussion board, where this confusion could be easily cleared up. Not only did they remove it but what did exist is now deleted. Not recommended in any way for a person who needs to learn a language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I think that this is a really fun and innovative way of learning! It's like playing a educational game that's both enjoyable and educational! There are a lot of languages to learn here. But just two things bug me. 1. It is extremely hard to get gems and the cost of things is a lot more than what you get. 2. WHY CAN'T WE LEARN ENGLISH IN ENGLISH? Overall, this is a really good app! I am left, flabbergasted. #Duolingo"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"waaaay too many ads, as to be able to learn anything. it used to be the best learning app, now it is just a waste of time that pushes you to pay after every single mini lesson. if you are not able to create a community based on quality and service, pushing this kind of business model really makes you look desperate and creates a very uninviting welcoming to your users. you sold your souls Duolingo!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I loved this app when I used it a few years ago. Decided to get back into it for a new langu. I wish they didn't get rid of the games.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Fantastic app that opens up the opportunity to take a step into learning a new language. It encourages you to keep motivated and helps you learn in bitesize chunks. Great app that is helping me fulfill a goal in life.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is an amazing help when learning a language and has a way of making it fun. When you do well it gives you rewards unlike being in a classroom where all you would get was a plain old good job. Duolingo is also an icon and Duolingos social media accounts are perfecto.

It said incorrect it was ""I am"" so I typed in that and it says no... incorrect it wants ""a boy"". I kept following the prompts and it was like being gaslit by an app. No skip button. No report error in program button. Nothing. I had to back out of the program as it was having some sort of meltdown and wouldn't allow me to progress. I'll be paying to get babble."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Superbly designed language learning programme. Learning becomes almost effortless. The programme keeps me engaged and motivated. brilliant use of interleaving, chunking and spaced revision reinforced and buttressed with regular retrieval practice. Enjoying every minute!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I was learning French, using the version in Spanish. The app asked me to translate ""Come"" (eat). I translated directly as ""Mange"". However, the app said I was wrong, as the answer was ""Elle Mange"" (she eats). For some reason, the answer required for me to use an article, whereas it was not necessary as per the question. Duolingo has these kind of arbitrary problems, which make it not so reliable, at best, as a language learning app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Good to practice and memorize vocabulary. Not very good to actually teach a language. You will need other materials to learn. The gamification system is very good to keep you practicing consistently.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I want you to change when I speak to let it be right. Because when I say it right, it counts as wrong. Also you told me that that was the way to pronounce it but when I say it exactly like them it counts it as wrong. Otherwise the app is fine, though it's pretty slow. Please fix the audio."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Having issues lately with not being able to use predictive text in Duolingo. Using Google Keyboard for multiple languages and it works outside of DL but not in it. Can't figure out how to re-enable this feature.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo has a longstanding history of removing user-favorite features over the years, despite vocal pushback. In December 2023 they then fired their staff in favor of AI, which will never be able to replicate or learn the human aspects of language. Huge disappointment. The app will only get worse."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The Irish language version is pretty bad. The male voices are all over the place. The sound quality is awful and the pronunciation is waaay off to the point of just being wrong with many of the words... Not great and not very enjoyable.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have been to this app for over 6 months. This is best app for leaning various languages. This app has looked after the simplicity in understanding and leaning a language. no matter which language. Really love it. Everyone should go for it. Lot of thanks to Duolingo ‚ù§Ô∏èüòÄüòÄ
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"At first I thought it was great. And I really tried to stick with it. But then in my German lessons the only thing that I can get wrong is the difference between when to use die, der, or das. Why does Duolingo refuse to just tell you when to use what I don't know you won't tell me so then I have to exit your app to go into an external Source you are terrible programmers why would you design that to where the user has to leave your app to learn? Shouldn't you be able to do everything in Duolingo"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It feels like, in the form of lessons, you take one step forward, then two steps back. I used to use the in lesson comments to learn from others mistakes, since you don't offer any in lesson advice when we make mistakes. I am actively hunting a different language app so I can ditch this. I recommend to anyone reading this comment to look for something else."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is pretty good for both initial learning and review. Some of the Korean constructions are incorrect, however, and they only offer simplified Chinese characters. I would give five stars for sure if they would address these issues!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Over the past few days I have not been able to even open the app. It goes to the green duolingo screen and stays there and goes no farther. I have tried clearing the cache and restarting my device with no result.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"very good way to learn multiple languages, I have been taking Spanish German French and Italian, been very getting getting to know these languages and having duolingo teach me and give me above and beyond support. I reccomend this app to anyone wishing to learn another language. Everyone's gotta start somewhere native languages English but semi fluent in Spanish and can speak elementary German. Great use of time while my toe is fractured."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Now that news of AI replacing translators are out, I'll be deleting Duolingo and actively advising everyone I know to switch to an alternative. Making your leftover employeers correct after an AI that has most likely been trained on unethical databases is not what I want to help maintain. I was already dissatisfied with Duolingo seeing as they removed lots of features that made it unique, like the forum & clubs, and that majority of courses was done by volunteers, but this is the final nail."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, it was great in the beginning, when I didn't know any better. Learning Japanese, thinking it's going well, then speaking to a japanese friend and finding it's not quite right, duo says gohan is Rice but it's actually not, it's cooked meal or cooked rice. I think I would rather study an actual course, than waste my time on half-assed software teaching, that's more competitively focused than actual teaching."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I enjoyed using this app, thanks to the work of translators putting their love into it. Then I learned that Duolingo laid off most of their translators in favor of AI, that just makes this feel so impersonal. Knowing what I'm learning from didn't even come from a human. How can I enjoy something that someone wasn't bothered to make? And it's all in the name of corporate greed"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used this app daily for 70 days to learn a language, recently i have started encountering more and more problems that led to me finding out that the translators who used to create questions were fired and replaced with robots. The drop with quality has made me abandon the app for good as I no longer believe it can supplement my language learning correctly."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App and lessons are buggy .Several lessons say you are entering a wrong answer, even when correct answers are chosen. Currently stuck without any way to progress to next level/lesson. Tried updating and still doesn't work."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo sucks, there's almost zero academic instruction, it's just a bunch of childlike mini games. Duolingo is far worse than the majority of the other language learning apps. Seriously, give any of them a try, after spending 10 minutes on Memrise I realised just how minimal learning progress one makes with Duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Just started, so far it's paying off and enjoying myself in the process. If I could get reminders for lessons with texts as well as well with the emails that would be helpful. Would definitely recommend this app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Ok, so they forced the new UI on everyone despite people not liking it at all but it does help with vocab and grammar. It's not great at actually moving on conversation as some other tools but it is easy to use."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,perfect! they move with a slow pace that is perfect for beginners they break down lessons into very small exercises that can be completed in 2-10 minutes that you can easily take any time of the day I have a lot to say about how good and easy they made language learning
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Impossible to use the microphone for the tests somehow, even though it was possible before. But most of all, the number of ads that have been added over the years is quite impressive, and making the learning not enjoyable at all"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it's a really wonderful app, I've improved overtime in learning my preferred language. Their built-in reminders also help in keeping you active or back on track even when you're busy or confused. Thanks to the team. #Duolingo"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,good to get started. only Latin American Spanish so limited if you want to learn Spanish for Spain. not enough effective ways to review and revise. focus is too much on getting points and not enough on thorough quality learning
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ridiculous to pay for the app and then while using the app having to pay for gems or whatever to get time boost for lessons. And if you don't, you have to end the session. I'm not trying to hurry and to learn. Rushing us to learn is a horrible way to teach. Find another app or don't use any pay services within duolingo, if possible. Idk, not gonna continue to find out."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Is a great way to start learning a new language, keeps you motivated. teaches you how to put sentences together and common words. but you will need to go away and find some new vocabulary, it's only taught me how to ask for two of something so far, I need to learn more numbers haha"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app much!! It is so user friendly and really helps you learn a language and is not boring at all. It keeps your engaged and makes you want to learn and keep learning. Yes it has ads, but they are not super annoying like some."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Feels like a game. Doesn't do the best job of teaching the basics. counting, alphabet, etc. Will give you phrases and words that are helpful in understanding the basics. Overall, good!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a good app to start using as a beginner,but once you know the basics,it gets boring and theres no motivation apart from wanting to work on conservative topics. Well it helped me. It all depends on how you learn."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I's decent to learn with and fun, but I really wish when you are listening to the single word and select it from 2 choices, they would at least tell you what the word means in English. Also it would be helpful to include grammar rules and whatnot."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo recently laid off many of their employees to cut costs, so now most of their sentences are generated with AI. I will not support a company that engages in these business practices. They don't value the art of teaching languages, and it shows in the recent changes, as the sentences have become noticeably worse since removing native speakers from the teaching process."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's extremely telling how the quality of the translations on the app has decreased over these past weeks. I, for one, would rather have correct and concise translations that allows me to really learn a language, knowing it has a human understanding and checking my process on how i am better able to communicate with other people. IA is ruining everything."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Learning is great just not interested in Streaks, Leader Boards or Leagues ect. It's not a competition for me it's an exercise. over all it does help learn and is quite the funny app with its design and characters."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,There's no problem at all with Duolingo. The ads may be annoying but the Super Duolingo feature is super cheap. Its super fun and I reccomend it to people who are willing to learn a new language.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have had to use google translate for most of the USEFUL stuff, like how to ask your name, where the train station is, etc. I have been learning Swedish for a few months now, I'm on unit 12, and it hasn't even mentioned learning the numbers above one yet. It also keeps telling me that I have got a question wrong when I have got it correct. I would definately NOT reccomend this app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Amazing for learning languages but whenever they have deals for duolingo pro, they always bump up the base price so the discount is never anywhere near 60% off. Discount the family plan and I'll snatch it up. Other than the slight deception when sales come around, it's a good app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"very fun structure of learning you can always feel like you achieve something and even though the free experience is great even having some fun insensitives like earning hearts, the super version does speed up the learning process. Can recommend"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have had this for one day and am loving it I have learned so much! The only thing is I keep getting ads for super Duolingo. Update: I love the speak this sentence and I love if you are not in a place where you can listen to them you can just press can't speak or listen
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have really enjoyed the gamified learning Duolingo provides, but I recently learned much of their staff has been laid off in order to switch to AI translation services. This completely destroys my trust. AI is known to make mistakes, and while they appear to have retained a small amount of staff to check these translations, I no longer trust that the language I am learning will be provided to me accurately. If they are willing to cut corners with translation, what else will they skimp on?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,app has changed over time. what I do not enjoy are the tests at the end of a unit. they are totally unrelated to the material just reviewed. and no response on mistakes reported regarding wrong hints or blatant errors. I keep with this app just to keep practicing. just ok
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Some exercises are not recognising the word choices you make, they just flash red and you eventually have to lose a heart to continue. After the last update (February 2024) the onscreen keyboard has started to play up."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it's easy to learn and recall at ease. within three days, I have been able to speak and write ‚úçÔ∏è on my own. much fun, it's interesting and amazing as well. I urge each and every one to participate and improve upon their French language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I just finished a hard quest and I didn't receive it on my monthly challenge! Honestly, this app has had me frustrated for the past year with its new update on quests and the way how its set up. MAKE THE CHALLENGES WITH XP!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This has barely taught me anything over a year of use. Do not use this if you want to be fluent. I couldn't be more disappointed in my streak of over 500 days. Don't waste your time like I did l. Update: I'm at 550+ days and even more disappointed. I've worked in games for 20 years and this is absolutely pathetic. Even worked on language games for Ubisoft and this is criminally under developed.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Fun and good to learn basic vocabulary and verbs. Recommended if you intend to travel and want to raise your awareness. Should be able to schedule a vacation so you don't lose your streak though.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's an amazing app it helps you learn a language faster than you would expect and since it's designed just like a game it doesn't get boring at all and you can make challenges with your family members and there are a few in the app aswell it also helps me spend time more productively.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Had a really fun year with a super family plan that I added my friends to. We got really competitive and uplifted each other throughout, but Im cancelling my subscription and we're all migrating to another app because Duolingo laid off workers to use ai instead. I don't know how they got so greedy as to remove humans from the app we're all using to connect with other humans, but I'm going somewhere that pays real human beings to teach"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great way to start to learn a language for free. For me thoigh, a French speaker, there's too many repetitive exercises I could do without. The characters are fun and I like the variety of activities. Thanks Duo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Okay, several bugs here y'all need to fix: ‚Ä¢My own device never offers me spoken lessons, when I try to pick on the spoken targeted practice, it says ""you need to have your microphone turned on for this feature"" yet it is on. Forced to use other devices 2do it ‚Ä¢ Night owl/Early bird chests; Constantly, I will click on a notification I literally just watched get delivered to my phone and yet when it opens up the app, there's no actual chest available to claim, just as though I never had one..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Two years in and I kind of hate this thing, even though I'm pretty much addicted. It feels like it punishes you more the better you do. It's no motivation, and I give up far more easily now. It's been a fun couple of years though. Should also add there are waaaaay too many mistakes for a teaching app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I am loving this app the opportunity to learn a new language and in such a fun and memorable way and you don't even have to pay to get a great experience and still learn although I definitely plan on buying the boost my competitive and eager to learn mind can't wait to get the full experience
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Minor issues on a few tests which although reported several times, they never fix it. Besides if that the app is great, helps getting familiarised with the language, and improve reading and listening skills."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"First of, I will thank you for bet learning of all time and I have some advice for Duolingo. Here it is: in doulingo streak widget can you show us more attractive thing like when I finish only one lesson or nine lesson it shows nearly same emotion. That will be great if I end one or two lesson, the widget shows like that is not enougth. It jave to encourage to do more lesson for making the bird happier.Thanks for your attention."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Despite being far along in the process duolingo too often insists on recycling the same few words from the first few lessons while neglecting newer more relevant words to the extent that I'm forgetting them while redudantly drilling in words I knew even before I started using this app... like he, she, apple, man, woman, cup 1000 times over FFS! Wasting my time while teaching me nothing is 75%+ of my experience on duolingo and I'm getting sick of it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Was awesome when it had specialized discussion forums for each exercise, where people could ask and answer questions about specific exercises they just had. There were noobs, intermediate, and experts helping out, explaining, exampling, and linking to resources, sites, dictionaries.. out of sheer kindness. This was what compensated for the lack of clarity and explanations, especially when we were expected to otherwise learn from unexplained examples alone. Now, without the forums: from 5‚≠ê to 1‚≠ê."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Best app for learning grammer and vocabulary intuitively without wasting time and energy searching some explanations of them. All what it takes 30 minutes a day and see how your fluency will go up.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great free language lessons that you can follow along at your own pace. They now have music and maths learning features as well, but only in iOS app, unfortunately it's not available in Android app. I wonder when they are planning to release for Android."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There's this bug when everytime i finished a lesson there will be like loading that never stop ( i assume that ads that doesnt load) it's kinda irritating everytime I finished a lesson, i need to get out the app and get on again. But i like the lesson, 3 star for now"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I noticed that some users have the ""Words"" feature to learn words learnt from previous sections, whereas I do not have even after I subscribe for 1 year Super. There are also some Listening courses without voice! Will rate 5star if this is fixed"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I would give 5 stars to Duolingo as a language learning supplement (and only as a supplement), but they laid off employees to replace with AI in the name of profits, so they get 1 star. Language is about humanity and the human experience. Not only does the app lack human cultural context needed to properly teach a language, the company itself also lacks humanity in its relationship to employees that depend on income to survive under late-stage capitalism. Be better and I'll give a better review."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Update. They keep updating the app, but not actually making changes to help you. There have been zero updates to this app that actually add helpful features. In fact they just updated to remove keyboard auto complete and auto correct word suggestions which makes the app a pain to type in now. I will be requesting a complete refund."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Best learning app for any beginner I am reducing to 3 stars because this used to be fun app. And now with the heart system it's really difficult to learn free. Atleast the hearts should refill in an hour or should refil when we complete a lesson successfully. This will keep the learner motivated and learn more.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's a game-changer, but ever since they got the new heart system, they not only cut a chance for a simple typo, but also say that you need to subscribe to premium to get more. Great content, terrible features"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a great learning app, and it repeats words necessary for memorizing. The only problem is the repetitive ads, and I get that they need to make money. So, overall, great app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The most helpful aspect of this app was the discussion feature on each question; you could ask for & get explanations of the translations. So naturally they got rid of it. Downsized so AI could replace people. Will likely unsubscribe soon, get annoyed by the ads & hobbled progress, then uninstall."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I can't do any speaking exercises, it always say ""turn on your microphone"" even if I have the microphone on and all permissions enable. The app is great at all, it's really helping me with french lessons :)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a fantastic app for learning a new language. The family plan super account is very affordable. The free version is super nice also, but the infinite hearts from super Duolingo encourage my kids to learn faster. Now my kids, my girlfriend, and I are all learning Japanese. I really appreciate this app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Well made languages app but very irritating and patronising that when you return to the app after a break it forces you into 'refresher' lessons which 'teach' you the most basic vocabulary like 'apple' and 'he is'. It's the same every time. So annoying
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Since DuoLingo fired human translators and started using AI, I've been getting correct answers marked wrong and it's been really frustrating!! Bring back HUMAN translators!!! I've been using DuoLingo since just before the pandemic, about 4 years now. I've never had to report answers until the past month!!! I've reached a milestone but I will be deactivating my account!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Recent changes have been awful. No more explanations, so we end up having synonyms (for instance) but not how to use them. The local forums with tips and questions from the community are not there anymore. SOOOOOOOOOO many mistakes, suggested answers are not accepted elsewhere, passing a question because we can't listen or speak can sometimes invalidate the next test (hence one life less). It is becoming a burden to learn a language, and to which profit? Well yours, not the one of the users."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is incredibly annoying. The lessons are fine but the devs have added so many annoying features. The app asks every couple days to install the widget, no way to silence the request. At the end of each lesson there's least 5 screens to click through per lesson, usually more, all useless stuff no one over the age 12 cares about. No way to silence them and the devs are always adding more. Cause that what this app needs is to be even more annoying. Please stop."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They removed the ability to download courses offline. Even if you pay you need to have data or wifi. I work in remote areas and wanted to do lessons in my down time. Dont support this app, there are other choices."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm enjoying using but I've yet to speak Greek to somebody who is Greek (or anybody) so who knows if I have actually learnt anything? I subscribed because I got fed up with being locked out when I had the time to learn, I'm pleased I did, I find if much easier to do a lesson when I actually have the time. I feel more motivated now as I get a reminder! Slightly annoying creatures that I think are supposed to be motivation, but I just try my hardest to ignore them, I'm not 4 years old!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"2024-02: you can send messages with congratulations, but the person receiving them can read them, weird... 2024-01:Sometimes there are pictures to the exercises, but they don't always make sense to the question. Can't skip using the streak saver."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"i am upset with the company's decision to lay off 10% of its workers and instead rely more on language learning models :( machine learning is a good *tool*, but replacing workers with technology means both they and the end customer suffers (AI models are prone to cluttering and so-called ""inbreeding""). progress is good, but layoffs are never a good thing, and i am disappointed in an app i came to love :("
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Things that would benefit us in the learning process would be a dictionary or flash cards. I've tried Spanish, Japanese, and Korean so far. Spanish i tried the longest and got bored of it. The Korean lessons suck in comparison to Japanese. Both start with letters but Korean jumps straight into learning a whole sentence and relies on me reading. Japanese has the word spelled in english under the word but the Japanese lessons dont have speaking as part of the practice. Why are they so different?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The gamification significantly increases the engagement, I could play this game for hours if given the time. It really sets itself out from many other just like it. I would like to see more characters added, however."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a wonderful app and is a great way to learn and teach other languages . And I love the characters and how Duolingo, the characters cheer you on and I love how Duolingo reminds you if you're missing a lesson or you need to do a lesson. I'm just saying it's my opinion you should get the app it's wonderful and it's a great way to learn. p.s. I'm learning Japanese and Spanish and it helps you to try to speak or understand the languages .‚ù§Ô∏è"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I started in May and have a 200 day streak. Since I've been using it, they removed their massively helpful forums for no clear reason. The app looks shinier than ever, but it's steadily become a worse tool to learn from. Today I see they fired over half their staff to use AI instead. Extremelt unhappily uninstalling. Busuu seems better so far, it is loaded with human speakers instead of robots."

Duolingo is really productive‚ù§
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's good if you are a complete beginner but becomes less and less useful as you progress in your language studies. Forming sentences like ""Pedro is a dog and likes cheese"" etc won't get you very far."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app. If you decide to go the free route, it can get annoying when you miss more than 3 times. However, if you pay for the subscription, you can fail as many times and don't have to wait a whole day to do a lesson. amazing app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a very useful app.Even small students(beginners) can also learn spoken English from it.It is like a game.Along with playing,one can improve his/her talking skill.Not only it learn us english but also it learn us other languages like Spanish,Japanese,etc.It is the most trusted app.... I'm very glad as well as happy on this app‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app -at least the Finnish course has really decreased in quality since the useless 'steps' update. The course is laughably short therefore useless, the daily refresh only gives me questions on one single sub topic (love and clothes), if you make a mistake on a lesson, you can no longer practice it at the end of the lesson. Often I get glitches completing the lesson in just one activity, if I don't click ""can't listen now"" literally every single activity will only be that, etc etc. Pathetic."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"this is an amazing app!!!üòçüëèüëèüëè I've tried millions of different apps, but none of them were as good as Duolingo!! I'm learning German and Russian really easily!!! you can even learn hardest languages really easily!! I love how it makes learning hard languages as easy and fun as a game!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I appreciate this tool very much. sometimes some of the lessons have topics of reading that I am not in agreement with, and that is troubling. if they were more tolerant of my beliefs, I would subscribe to the super duolingo. as it is, I can't support them with a subscription"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app itself and the way lessons work is fine. But recently duolingo has laid off about 10% of their contractors and moved into AI for the lessons. Know how...bad AI can be in translating, I'd rather not spend my time learning in this app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo has become increasingly buggy, with questions that do not allow you to enter an answer. They have also taken away community support, and maintain their longstanding policy of never directly teaching or explaining anything. Despite being with the platform for several years, I probably won't he renewing my subscription when it expires."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I was using Duolingo as a supplement to my Japanese lessons, but the quality of the sentences has gone down recently. Found out the reason why is that they're now using AI and fired a bunch of people, shameful. I'm not renewing my yearly subscription because I don't want AI to teach me fake words and meanings."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is great and all praise the green owl, etc, but I just wanted to thank the Welsh language team, a couple of months ago we had a bunch of lessons updated and now there are new and better voice-overs (or whatever the word, sorry) and there are also free events available to practice your Welsh and it all makes me incredibly happy. Felly, diolch yn fawr i chi i gyd, t√Æm Cymraeg!! Upd. Thanks for updating the Welsh course again!‚ô•Ô∏è"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Been playfully helpful. Is a little repetitive & slow though, renders your efforts & progress sluggish. Overall impressed nonetheless. Although this alone is not enough to sufficiently learn a new language, accompany it with other measures."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's good for those who have times for learning everyday, but I think the sessions is slower than it should be, at least for me. It make me learn slower. That's why many people tired of duolingo, just imagine you forced to do the same repetitive thing everyday."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a superb app to help you learn languages. I used this app to learn Dutch for a year before moving to the Netherlands. When I moved to NL Dutch people where complimenting how good I am with the language eventhough I was 1 month living in the country. Now that I am living here in the Netherlands for 1 year and 6 months, I still get compliments how good my dutch is for someone who lives here for a short period of time. I always tell them that I just practice with the duolingo app everyday"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"In German course, the guidebook of section 2 lesson 6 doesn't load. It's been over a month this bug has stopped my course plan and it is frustrating. Meanwhile I've updated the app two times and in none of them the bug fixed."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The new updates continue to ruin Duolingo. I get more unmotivated to learn a new language using this app whenever a new update completely changes how the learning modules work. Learning the language's alphabet is not considered a lesson. The new way to earn badges is terrible and forces you to be on the app much longer than you can or would like to be. I would not recommend using Duolingo to learn a new language if it continues to release new updates that change the learning courses.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've had a lot more time to think about Duolingo and here's what I think. If you want to learn a language this is probably your last resort, your bottom of the barrel. As far as I've seen we learn other languages, not just English, much better by seeing them in normal conversations. I feel like it has something to do with how personal it is."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Wow. Just wow. In a day I'm able to learn simple phrases and words. Not only that, but this game is fun! I love how when on mess up, Duo goes over that question with me! Although, when you miss a lesson or unstall the app, he still sends you messages and that's the one thing I don't like. Buy other than that this game is great!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app is very unreliable only opens when it wants to maybe every third or fourth time you try. I paid ¬£47 and I now can't even get an answer or a refund after messaging them. I get an email everyday to tell me to use the course but then it won't open.I feel like I've been conned..useless!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Personally, I think this app is great for me to just touch up my german skills, and keep myself occupied but at the same time I am learning!Duolingo makes it fun to learn new things in the language department and I can't wait until my hard work pays off. 10/10 would recomend."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Your heart system is terrible, particularly for new content that users may not be familiar with. Right now, I'm struggling with grammatical errors, and instead of being able to practice and learn from mistakes, I'm sent back to grinding 5 hearts to learn how to say the word sugar over and over. It's not even that they're strapped for cash, you're doing 1-2 adverts per lesson now on the free mode."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"When I say words and/or phrases that repeat, it never picks up the repeated part (ex. Nous nous reveillons, it only picks up the first ""nous""). Also, a lot of the sentences are something no one would ever say."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing! Not only is it intelligible but it is also fun for lots of people. The thing I don't like about duolingo is the first 4 lessons of each course, like it was made to repell players ( specialy the king on course)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If I wanted to learn language from an AI, I would just go do that. I used Duolingo because it was supposed to be made with thought and care behind the lessons. Using AI shows the opposite. Between this and removing community notes and forums, Duolingo's lost all my confidence in the quality of their lessons and in their respect for their customers. I will definitely never pay for it again; why would I do that when any large language model can give me the same product offer now?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Doesn't let you play/learn as much as you want. Makes you wait to earn hearts if you make 5 mistakes. therefore prolonging the learning time. I want unlimited learning time available. I'd be better if it also told you the correct answer if you missed on so you know the correct answer next time. instead it just says it's incorrect.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's really good for learning the absolute basics of language. I'm starting my Chinese journey and I know for me to become fluent or close to fluent I'm going to have to do more than duolingo but it's fantastic for starting out. Keep on learning!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app, however it would be nice to decide what type of questions you get assigned. This is because I'm extremely dyslexic and so find it pretty much impossible to do the spelling questions. So if you could add an option for people like me to skip them then this app would be a 5/5 Also when translating questions could you translate it using the grama from that language? For example if I'm learning Spanish then I'd rather have the English translation be in Spanish grama then English gramar"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There's a bug lately that's very annoying and irritating. Some music plays in the background and hampers the learning experience. I've reported this to the developer but there's no feedback, unfortunately."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Takes a lot of time to progress to learning ""usual"" sentences, and the AI voice does not sound like a real person speaking the language. But good for learning vocabulary."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app makes learning a language possible and fun. Highly recommended! Mandarin Chinese is supposed to be one of the hardest languages, and as an American I am learning it and can start to understand some of the dramas I watch on YouTube. Way cool!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I like the program. It seems to use common phrases and words. There just isn't very much study and no recap information you can review before each lesson. I do like the speaking phrases questions.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Spent so much time (months)saving up these stupid gems to get the bonus lessons, finally was able to buy them, and before I could even do 1 lesson, the update erased it all, those bonus lessons no longer exist and the gems were not refunded. Also, you make a mistake, and you're not allowed to practice for the rest of the day, if I get something wrong I want MORE practice not less, but they won't let you keep practicing unless you score 100%, but why use this app if I already know it?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Voice recognition is terrible. You can say the sentence exactly the same way 2 or 3 times and it says you're wrong. Also, some of the characters speak so fast you can't understand them, even on slow speed. They are not careful to enunciate the feminine ""a"" or the masculine ""o."""
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,best app to learn different languages it really helps you a lot if you are struggling so download it it exposes you to different kind of languages that you can learn but most thing I'm disappointed in about this app is that it doesn't have languages like xhosa but besides that it has a really good app and hope you guys are noted and read this interview inspires you and it's amazing guys like literally I have been practising for a whole month and just help me and I can speak fluent Spanish Zulu ‚ò∫
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I enjoy the fast paced lessons with some repetition to help with learning but not too much repetition to were it gets old because then the lessons change and you move to learning new words and the lessons get more challenging. I purchased Duo Lingo Plus
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,nice way to learn other languages. a bit annoyed paying makes you pay for an entire year without notice! I don't mind as I want a subscription but would have been nice to be warned. apart from that very good. Recommended!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing for learning new languages without having to take a actual class. It has good motivation and makes learning easy and fun, definitely recommend for people wanting to learn a language, new or relearning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really appreciate the work and couldn't put into words, how I am thankful for such a beautiful and useful educational app. If you are a beginner intermediate or advanced learner of a particular language .... it is a must app for this purpose. They have tapped the fun way of learning and actually it is."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is great I'm learning Japanese and Spanish but one thing they should fix is the spacing of letters because when I'm doing the Japanese lesson ""to"" is too close to the other words. Also in Spanish when it wants me to pick a word and then type a sentence it would let me space."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have been using Duolingo for the past 3 years mostly learning French. However, I began Spanish last year. The app makes learning a new language fun and easy. Not to say it is not challenging, it is equally enjoyable. The exercises are well laid out and allow you to build on previous learnings. Give it a try for free. you will love it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's useless...I've have done a 155 day streak and yet I don't really know how to correctly use Spanish words...It doesn't explain anything, it just gives the word and you answer questions without really understanding why that word is used. The only times it explains stuff is when you repeatedly get it wrong which isn't a good way to teach at all So, If I guessed correctly a lot how does that teach me the proper way to use it? I have learned more in a 2 hour Spanish class then in 155 days..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm doing the Japanese course, and there's a lot of frustrations. Female-presenting characters using male words. Kanji regularly bring pronounced wrong (although at least the hiragana above is correct). And then teaching things like corporate pollution before basic body parts and foods? Political messaging is coming in pretty hard, and even when I agree, the tone is grating. Also, please don't teach kanji writing if you won't respect the stroke order."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is an easy and fun way to learn new languages even if your schedule is packed! I'm having fun and Duolingo makes me feel rewarded when I learn something new. Everything is pretty much free but somethings are better and easier if you subscribe to Duolingo Super and it does help you and Duolingo to thrive.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Editing this. It's lost a star because instead of adding functionality like grammar tips and stories to a language I am studying (Polish) they have removed grammar tips from two others (Italian and German) - why?! That is absolutely insane, please put the tips back in as soon as possible and add to the Polish section!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very good, but sometimes in speaking exercises it can't hear me and I would also like the option to learn different tenses in languages earlier. It is very comprehensive and has good games though."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's really great! So far no problems. I'm currently learning Japanese rn which means i need to learn the alphabet as well. Even tho they don't make you do writing exercises in real life to be more capable of the alphabet, i can still manage it as it's not a major problem for me :)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's a really good learning app but the older version was way better when it was eggs that version was way better and also my friend with an iPhone have these new choices ( math and music) and for some reason I (android ) can't find them I even updated the app and all but still Plss try to make duo better
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo has fired most of their translators and replaced them with ai. The state of this app is going to become completely unexcusable and unusable. Do not download this app, do not trust their lessons, do not accept this state of being. Until they reverse this decision and reinstate human translators you're literally better off using Google translate. It's the same thing at this point."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have been using the app for a quite a long time now, it has been fantastic until now. However there is some sort of music being played in the background every time I start a lesson. This has never happened before, it's happening since morning. Very irritating. Please check into this."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like Duolingo because it is structured well, and the learning curve is gradual, and can be accelerated by the learner. More repetition of older words would be helpful."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm very disappointed that they are laying of translators in favor of switching to AI. I guess it's time to find another language learning platform unless they change back to human translators. Also, the ads are way too loud."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Its the best game based leraning app i have ever played. It is even more fun to play duolingo and learn languages than playing other mobile games. Its so easy to learn languages with this app. It helped me alot with my school studies too. My sister also uses this app. I really recommond to the one who is reading this review to try out this app. Bye I am going to learn languages... Join me!!! THANK YOU!!!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Learning on Duolingo is so much fun. It's fascinating how the app combines having fun and being productivity just same way. I watch the ads to support them, even the subscription is super affordable. The app is amazing."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Amazing App to learn foreign languages! Never thought it would be possible to learn Russian this easily by myself. It has also improved a lot compared to the previous versions of Duolingo! Thank you Keep on improving to keep on learning!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's gets too repetitive and does not move on at a good pace. Also, the order of what is to be learned seems either out of order, out of place, or unnecessary, compared to what would be more basic in a normal conversation."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This learning tool used to be way better. Now almost every feature is aggressively monetized using high pressure sales tactics including sunken cost. Example: rapid review time extensions costs 100 gems (once a day thing). ""You only have 1 exercise left! Would you like to extend the time limit for 450 gems?!"" They will also have you watch insufferable ads between lessons. Oh good."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I loved loved this app I was learning Japanese! But after I got a 100 something day streak it was giving me errors about doing lessons it said try again later but I did and it didn't work so I wasn't able to continue my streak I am very upset about this because my streak was my confidence it made me happy so then when it broke I also broke I am very upset and if that didn't happen this would be an easy 5 stars I gave it the 2 stars because this app is amazing but that one problem really hurt me.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good for the most part, dose it job at teaching. Somethings are behind a pay wall but I think you can unlock it by learning everyday in a week, not losing a streak. I don't have much constructive criticism but it's a alright app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The app crashes anytime I enter a new league. And continues crashing every time I try to hit continue until I reinstall the app. Edit: The bugs seem to be fixed now. Love this app!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"this app has been fantastic for learning Spanish. definitely better than high school lessons, being a stoned uninterested kid- ""learning"" from a coach who wasn't all that great at teaching it. definitely blows the lame highschool class out of the water as far as retaining the info and using it"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I give this app named Duolingo 5 out of 5 cause i chose the language korean and it made me learn it so fast. It just took me 2 days and I learned alphabet of korean. I think many of the people can use this app cause they can also learn their favorite language or want to learn other languages like English, Hind, France, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and a lot more languages and they don't have to worry cause this app is for free.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Learning at an accelerated pace! Tried the iOS version on my iPad and it's missing the vibration for the streak animation and the sound celebration at the end as well. Please keep those intact for Android.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like duolingo but there is a bug when i use the app for to long there will be no animation (i already check the settings),so i need to delete it and install it to have but after a few times of delete and installing i can't share anything on the app so i cant get limited rewards."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Pros: Not listing since Duolingo is unusable. Cons: Blocks you from early on if you don't Create an Account. Won't let you choose your Location when Creating an Account. Requires a Phone Number. I'm unable to continue with Duolingo because my Phone was set to China upon its Manufacture even though I'm not in China. Duolingo will not allow me to manually set my location nor Sign up with an email. Rendering it unusable.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love the app, but I have been so disappointed that after all the hype from duocon, math and music are still unavailable after over 3 months of waiting. Duo has not communicated when this will be made widely available to non-ios devices other than a vague ""soon"" stated in the announcement post from late October 2023. It feels so unfair for a learning app to be withholding resources for no specified reason."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a great app for language learners. I'm learning Japanese. If someone is learning Japanese I recommend to first start learning Hiragana. If you were wondering, why I gave this app 4 stars its because I had an account before I just couldn't log in so had to make another one. Thank you for taking your time to read my feedback. Have a nice day!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've used this app so much, and for that, I'm grateful. But I recently learned that Duolingo fired its contract translators, and lessons are now AI generated, with a few humans only checking AI work. For an app celebrating the human connection of language, this is profoundly wrong and deeply disappointing. I'm sorry to throw away my streak record, but I can't support a company that discards its human knowledge workers for profit."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I LOVE Duolingo it has been the best experience ever.instead of having to take classes I use Duolingo.it's set up like a game where you have different leagues and can go up.You get gems for completing streaks.I have had nothing but good come for this you can learn multiple languages at once.unlike other apps Duolingo will let you play for HOURS none stop.Depending on how much time you put into Duolingo you will be better at speaking reading spelling different languages.I have learned a lot.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,while I accept that you need to place ads at the end of the lessons. The game ads are too long and they interfere in the ability to focus on learning. If you want a better review adjust the length of the advertisements.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I am super impressed! I have tried to learn Spanish before and I couldn't get it to stick and with other apps they let you learn the basics then you can't go past the charge you. With this app I'm able to practice every day no charge! Just learning ‚ù§Ô∏è
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Wish there was a list of the learned words. Also throws words never learned into the mix and it gets frustrating. Overall, it can be a fun and useful tool for learning the basics."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Works fast, easy to do when you have spare time. I do it every night before bedtime. Phone is having problems tho lately so it skips or won't open. Still working around it. Buffering now."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,it's really a good application to learn the various language yeah but wanted something to learn in about 40-45 days as soon as possible and yeah I want to add something that if they can manage all the word's glossary in one section so we can remember it by looking there daily thank you so much Duolingo and it's team ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"No explanation of grammatical rules. Just guessing, and trial and error. You can't even view the gender or case of a noun. Full of wasted teaching opportunities. This is a very expensive stack of flash cards. Can't wait for a competitor to eat their lunch."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy it for Japanese. It's easy for basics so far. On the ""what sound does this make"" questions, I wish it wouldn't read the characters out loud to you, because that gives away the answer and makes me feel like I'm not learning anything from those ones."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"awesome app to learn new languages, very easy and fun to use too, way better than Babbel plus it's all free to use, you get the occasional ad which is absolutely fine for an app with so much to offer, i would definitely recommend Duolingo for anyone wanting to learn one or more new languages."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I recommend learning your numbers elsewhere first if you're travelling but this gives you more than enough after one month to feel confident speaking a little to locals. I would recommend it to anyone. great way to practice and learn words.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The yearly subscription is worth it, i found the free version deleterious to my progress due to the ads and the limited quantity of attempts so i ponied up the cash for an annual and I'm making much more progress now. if you can afford it, you'll appreciate it more"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very American based. Uses American-English colloqialisms instead of English-English (movie theater instead of cinema etc) and Americanisms you have to understand before you can understand the translation. Also lazy use of film quotes and absolutely pointless sentences ( I am laying on the floor crying and eating bread (!?)). Needs more intelligent adjustments to user progress. Also, what happened to the comments? They were helpful with learning, like in class discussions. Learning feels lonely."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app for learning languages. Too bad the XP is shared across all languages so players can exploit the lightning round feature by playing it in a language they only finished lesson 1 on. Additionally, some spoken sentences can never get accepted result, even by a native speaker."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Duolingo has updated a lot since the last few months - and it's amazing! The only thing is that I wish they would teach more grammar concepts along with the lessons as I have to use other sources to understand it.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Don't use AI to replace people. AI struggles with deciphering a riddle in English - trusting it to teach people new languages isn't the best option. This app has been helping me towards speaking with my girlfriend, true, but I'm worried I can't trust it anymore, if it uses AI to provide ""acceptable"" translations."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's becoming increasingly clear to me that android users are not a priority for duolingo. An android user pays the same as and iPhone user but sees them get new courses and features while their app stays the same. I also heard Duolingo are replacing translators with AI which cannot bode well.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"You can use the app for free in the lite version. It's not as good as the premium, but it helps you learn any language you want with a fun twist to it. The premium version is very good. It remembers every mistake you make. So, later on you can work on your weak areas"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Its awesome, the learning has been made easier,but I think you should focus more on improving graphics and enable some more features for people who do not wish to take Super Duolingo But overall, the app is awesome"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This is a nice üëç app for Learning every language whether it is English or French ü•ñ. I'm enjoying learning French my Mother is learning English but the problem is there is a premium plan of 2024. I don't like to take the subscription plan or Premium plan. I'm giving 4.8 stars only.

This is one of the few resources to learn vocabulary without paying, and you all have destroyed it over greed. I am disgusted."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I was originally going to write a veritable essay bemoaning the state of language learning, thanks to Duolingo. But then they decided it would be good to leverage so-called Artifical Intelligence instead of actual practicing experts in linguistic education. Anyone pushing this farce of technology in their business deserves to suffer in the wake of their ignorant and frankly malicious decision. But even before that, Duo was gamified to an absurd degree. Every choice antithetical to learning..."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is great for learning through repetition. It would be great, however, to communicate with someone of the App to know how to move on beyond Section 4 in Arabic - I 've been stuck in this section for 2 months."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After 3 years, I deleted my Super Family plan. If Duolingo wants to fire 10% of its employees to integrate AI into their platform, I'm not going to have any part of that. If they honestly think I'm going to pay an even higher subscription to talk to Chat GPT through their app (which I can do for free anyway) they're out of touch with reality. On top of that, my experience is already substantially worse because I use android. There are cheaper apps that do a better job teaching Japanese."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's been a pretty good app but for some reason after using it for quite some time it won't allow me to do the speaking part, each time it gets to the speaking question I have to skip it because it won't work. Overall, it's not a bad app for beginners."

Turns out from everything I've seen you CANNOT subscribe to a family plan for the duration of the sale, both my roommates lost their streaks and I am unable to buy a $120 membership with $135..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall very good. My only complaint is being a bit hard of hearing, some of the audio exercises are difficult to understand, especially for very short words. Still a great way to at least gain a basic understanding of other languages without needing to spend any money if you don't wish to."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So fun and easy. The exercises meant to be repetitive are mixed so that I'm hearing, speaking, reading, and writing the same words and phrases without being boring or redundant."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"they have nailed the Candy Crush formula so that their app feels like a semi-addictive game and scratches that itch in your brain. Even the reminder notifications to play it don't sound like they are desperate for you to return, it almost insulted me in a way but that is so much more likely to engage me than when I can taste pure desperation from mobile apps for my return"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'd give this a five star under the previous update. Before, I felt like I was learning at my own pace. Now, I feel like I'm being told how to learn. It's less effective, and it's made me less motivated. I want this to be good. I do. But it sounded like a downgrade when they announced it, and it's a downgrade in practice. Edit: They have improved the Path System, it is now mediocre. They've also laid off a large amount of their employees in favor of AI. I'd give 0 stars if I could."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A really quick, manageable and fun way to learn a little each day. It feels easy to pick things up using this although it could do with including more structed tips and explainations somewhere on grammar rules to aid understanding as you go"

I also can't find the setting to delete my progress. On the review lesson, I can't proceed since one random question will be completely disabled. E.g. I can't interact w/ screen. Requested a refund for my subs but it was rejected by google and was asked to contact the dev. Contacted directly then via email on receipt and got my refund."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I liked the app and purchased annual subscription. I suddenly lost my subscription. And there is no easy way to contact support. I will change my rating based on how fast my issue is resolved.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"No longer gives explanations, just examples, which makes it much harder to learn than the previous version. Also, while I don't care who is married to whom, EVERY SINGLE EXAMPLE IS SAME SEX. SHE HAS A GIRLFRIEND. HE HAS A HUSBAND. HOW ABOUT A LITTLE MORE VARIETY AND STOP USING THIS FOR SOMEONE'S AGENDA! I've had a paid subscription for several years, but this will most likely be the last."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Not entirely sure. Was learning Japanese for a week now. Already can read entire harigana without hints. Only complaint by far - examples are a bit dull. With that said, im only on my seventh chapter, so hopefully it will become harder and more ""human"". With that said, this format gets the job done. I can already say basic stuff from top of my head. ...it won't make you speak but hopefully it give base strong enough one can start consuming original media. And that's how I've learnt English :)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like hearing the language many times as I learn. It can be tedious, and some answers aren't accepted if the wording is different than they expect. They have feedback for those occasions, but you just notify the program that you think your answer should have been expected"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app! Addictive. Good use of gamification principles. Charts a gradual progression course using varied, fun and well-thought-out exercises, and targeting different language skills."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is not designed to teach language. It is only designed to drive engagement and get the user to pay for premium. I've had a 400 day streak and now have 100 day streak and have seen no improvement in my understanding. On top of all this, duo just laid off half their staff in favor of AI. Don't support these people till they get it back together"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Very cool. Game like environment. Very repetitive to reinforce. Could be less redundant so you'd learn more a little quicker. Love the comical points and prizes to motivate and encourage.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Great app till something goes wrong. For the past several weeks it won't open on my phone. Rebooted the phone many times. Updated the app many times. Have asked for assistance on several occasions but never get a reply.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,very nice interface with engaging tools to help motivate continuing on. it uses multiple points of attack to help place the information deep in the brain. I really enjoy it. keep up the good work Developers!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,A good app to get into a language and learn the basics. It's also really fun to participate in leagues and complete achievements. It serves as an additional motivator to keep learning!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good app, but won't let me upgrade to premium. So I have to just keep watching the ads which is annoying. The paywall has become quite aggressive which is annoying but more annoying because it won't let you actually PAY!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"i really enjoy this app! im currently learning japanese and on a 10 day learning streak. this is a really good app of your learning a new language. whats crazy is that you can learn klingon, a fictional language from the show ""star trek"". i would advise telling your friends."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"By making you use gems to start an activity puts me off practicing what I already have done which is vital to learning. instead you get pushed along at a very fast speed through the chapters and you don't feel like you've properly learned anything. If practicing what you'd already learned didn't cost any gems, I'd spend a lot more time on the app and actually be learning well."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,as you advance it's better to include other learning material. duolingo needs more voice speech in lessons. In addition the speed rounds need to increase by 15 mins. Not enough time to read and build a sentence when it's docking you for incorrectness
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"You have zero active practice through easy memorable output. Only input cannot help learning language, especially when we easily guess translations & don't use our own cognition, thus, we do not learn & memorize anything. Focus on conversation that allows active recall and speaking with easy comprehensible and repeated QA approach, like we can do with chatgpt. No feature to monitor time spend on the app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,2x experience bonus and advertisements conflict excessively. bugs or glitches slow interface during 2x exp as well. stuck loading and did not count xp gains towards leaderboard. if only there was a more mature version and slightly less colorful
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love Duolingo because it's not a waste of time. We stare at are phones all to much. Waste countless hours & days on games or arguing on social. Duolingo is edifying. It builds you up & make you a better person. Study Latin & then study the five romance languages. You will begin to notice a world around you you were unaware of. Then do Hebrew & Russian. Your understanding of the world will only benefit. the layout is top notch. with a reward system and game like feel it make learning fun.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's really helpful especially when you avail the Super Duolingo. The reminders, challenges, and construction of each level are well thought of. Also great when lots of people celebrate your success. Thanks, Duo :)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Garbage app. Wish I never discovered it, wish it didn't exist. I'm not learning languages, just trying to play the stupid league bot algorithms so I can stay in diamond league with only a score of 500... Cuz you know ... The players aren't real. Just bots that match your pace. Also don't get into rapid review.. just more incentive for you to buy gems to get the extended time item."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a great app. I have been using this app for 200 days now. But this app has not worked for me (Redmi Note 8 Ginko) for several days now.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Everything is perfect, I just think it would have been much better if you could have unlimited hearts without paying, as it is blocking you to learn if you made 5 mistakes, but anyhow the app is awesome!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a great way to start learning the basics of another language. Like many things, you get out of it what you put into it.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app it's not only learning any language u want u can follow friends and family and compete in a league so I would totally recommend this app to u want to learn any language go to Duolingo there r no adds apart from some times after a lesson saying get unlimited hearts blah blah blah which is quite annoying but that's the only thing bad about this app Rosie age 9 üòúüòùüòúüòùüòúüòù Love ya stay cute and preppy xxxxx
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is really great to and big helpful. I had closed this app for time being and now I re installed it and the voice doesn't come and also the apps speed has decreased too. It got hanged 2 times already and it had to be closed.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Highly recommended! I've just started to learn Dutch, and it's amazing just how quickly I seem to be picking it up just by doing the Duolingo exercises for 15 minutes per day! I'm amazed! it's fun to do, easy, and I've started to really enjoy it! Brilliant!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is absolutely perfect! I have nothing negative to say about it. I downloaded this app because most of my family speaks German. My grandmother really wanted me to learn German because she wanted me to ""carry on the family legacy"" but I really couldn't understand her or my family because they speak so weird with such thick accents so I turned to Duo to see if it would help me. My grandmother has never been prouder! Also my penpal is German so yeah GET DUOLINGO"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"updates make the app increasingly difficult to use and courses are often structured badly (especially welsh, which they have now stopped improving, likely because it doesn't make them enough money). Recent news has come out saying they are firing employees and replacing them with ai. overall a money hungry business, don't bother with it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Well at least atbstart it's amazing, it makes me reuse new words in interesting way. Not like usual boring way - here is the word, remember it P.s after some time using it, some flaws come up. If exercises become too hard you cannot really roll back. So I just had to delete my Japanese and started it from 0."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"A great app for learning a new language, quick and simple lessons. However the mic does not always work, it may need an update to keep up with the latest versions of Android"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's AMAZING!! üëåüëå‚ò∫Ô∏èIt makes learning actually fun and I have never experienced FUN LEARNING. So I recommend this app to anyone who is need of learning a language. And always if you want to add a new language to your courses then go on do it you can add as MANY AS YOU WANTüòÆüòÆüòÆüòÆ!!!!!!!!!!! So if you want to go to I dont know France then download duelingo and you will learn half in 2 Months!!!! So my opinion is if you are need or just for fun or whatever then DOWNLOAD DUELINGO!!!!!!!!! NOWWWWW
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"this has really helped me with learning German, I definitely recommend it if you want to learn a language to the point where you are conversational. I have been using Duolingo for about a year now, and I am definitely conversational and I speak and understand German a lot better, my favorite band is German so this will help me with understanding what the band is singing about! Thanks Duolingo ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is a very helpful app when it comes to learning another language. it's very patient and is very easy with the help of Duolingo. the only thing I don't like is that some of the languages I want/need to learn aren't there.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great app for review and vocabulary increase. Highly motivating with optional competitions and NPCs have distinct reading stylea. Warning app is partially AI managed so some (very few) modules may have some gramatical errors.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great if paired with another app. The free part is good enough, the oaid one is also good and affordable compared to others. I would recommend listening to an audiobook on what youre learning and then pair it with this. Thanks for the app!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo just laid off a whole bunch of their translator workers in an attempt to cut budget by using AI for translation. I don't believe that teaching other people language and translation can be done well by AI. I'm a long time user of Duolingo- on and off again for a few years, but currently have a 371 day streak. I will not be continuing to use Duolingo- I'm not going to risk learning and encoding mistakes based on AI translation."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I do enjoy duolingo. however its been occurring more lately that the graphics are missing and I am unable to complete frases or sentences. it gets frustrating when you are on the way to a 100 ¬∞/‚ñ™Ô∏é round.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app for learning a new language. The user experience is great, the lessons are well structured and engaging. Plus if you love a competition, the weekly leader board is great."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,honestly a very good app. better than alternatives I've used. personally this is the only app I think that can completely teach you a new language. the only other one is Rosetta. between this and Rosetta you'll learn a language quick. personally switched from Rosetta to duolingo for my practice.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Mothballing the course I'm taking and using ""guess the next word"" tech to provide translations rather than actual native speakers and qualified translators. It's sad to see this but there are other ways to learn languages. Do not allow a technology that doesn't actually understand how language works, merely the patterns, to teach you a language when other resources are available. AI is not even correctly named, nevermind wildly inappropriate to use in this context."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am enjoying the exercises. However, they expect you to speak words you learned literally 1 minute ago in the same exercise. (It's a bit hard if you have only seen the word for the very first time). but it's great. I love to learn."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Does not teach comprehension of any language's rules. Great learning experience but it doesn't give any guidance on pronunciations leading to repeated failed attempts at saying phrases. Doesn't explain anything, randomly introduces new vocabulary without any indication of how the words are supposed to be used."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Fun and engaging BUT DOES NOT ACTUALLY TEACH YOU THE RULES OF THE LANGUAGE YOU'RE TRYING TO LEARN. You will learn vocabulary, that's about it. You can intuitively learn the language rules in some cases. However you will look foolish if you are conversing with native speakers because you will sound like a toddler."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"the hints are often completely wrong. Also, many times, I will get an""incorrect"" before it even lets me attempt the translation. a few bugs in the system but at least it's free"

We all know AI can't teach languages yet but these people don't care for providing a quality service, just cutting costs. I paid my subscription until November but I want a refund, and they have been ignoring my emails. So, no. There are plenty of other Apps for learning languages."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I'd have given 5 star if not for the missing audio. It made me lose my progress in the time limit round. It happens frequently. Edit: changing it to three star because I didn't get my exp after I finished a round

The email responses I received were unhelpful."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've only used the free edition. it's good for beginners. I'd have given it a higher rating if, after you've finished all the classes, there was more variety in the section. it seems to just cycle through a small set of translations."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really like this app. Its awesome great. However, I've experienced having to go through exercises that I don't even know the words in spanish. Thats kinda unfair for a non native spanish speaker having to guess words without even knowing the meaning."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A fun a easy way to learn. Some of the recordings need tweaking so you can hear them better and understand the pronunciation, but other than minor bugs, it's a pretty decent app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ad infested like a malware website! This app used to be a fairly ok learning app for learning basic language. Now it is full of annoying ads that are seemingly meant to annoy the user until they click on it or pay for premium which is NOT WORTH IT!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"so far I have just started, never ever really thought about learning a new language until recently, and right now. this stuff is incredibly comprehensive and enjoyable to learn, definitely look forward to more learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Kinda OK for beginners. The vocabulary is very limited and insufficient for a meaningful conversation. The concept of teaching grammar by patterns is not too efficient.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app for a while and it's an amazing app because you really learn what you need to learn, and you learn about many things not just about one single thing. The most cool thing is that you can learn as many languages as you want. The only thing that I don't like is that you can't keep learning because you have lives, and you have to spend money on the super/premium Duolingo. Despite that, it is an amazing app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's very easy to pick and get right to the point helping you learn your language of choice in very small but great lessons, it's a slow process but if you really want to learn a new language and are committed I highly recommend"

I love this app and I'm hoping people install it, I think hearts should come faster and at least take 2hrs off and I heard about Duolingo off tiktok and it said that if you don't do your lessons he/she would come for you but it's not true and it just reminds you to do your lessons."

Honestly I have no issue with the app itself at the moment (other than them constantly pushing for a paid plan), but I just found out they fired a bunch of translators to switch to AI.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The app is fun and helpful but a big negative is that it doesn't allow you to set how you learn. I only want to learn to understand and speak Italian for my trip. I do not need to learn to write in Italian. The exercises have some where you type in the word. I don't want those but can't turn them off.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They don't offer all the correct options and they NEVER update it. They also don't accept more than one way of saying/translating the sentence as well as not offering any way of discerning the correct option without making a ""mistake"" according to them first!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Disappointing to see the move to using more ai, the Human touch is important to learning languages. It's already very robotic, giving sentences you wouldn't really use in everyday use, so I fear how badly it'll go with the increase of ai tech"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is very nice app and useful. I am enjoying learning two languages. It's very useful and helpful. It helps to improve English grammar, vocabulary, letting, writing, pronounciation, speaking and reading. I love it‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love the app it helps me learn german very quickly and i can learn as many words as i like in one day without forgetting them practicing it daily really helps and the streak helps me get back on the app Duolingo has great strategies to help you continue learning and one lesson is 2 minutes so it wouldnt take too much out of your day If youd like motivation i recommend challenging friends
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A really good app, not only for learning a language, but also gives ideas for learning anything new. Look, there's nothing wrong in learning a new language, but it's wrong if you learn it in the right way.Give it a try, it will surely help you. Good luck for your new journey. üëçüëç"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Nice language learning app. Currently taking French. I have an issue with Match Madness. Sometimes, there is a considerable lag in the speed at which the match for a word is generated. So, I'll select a word but it takes time for ~3-5s after for the match to appear."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I never knew as an English speaker I could still speak Italian without going to sit down in class rooms, pay a huge amount of money just to learn how to speak Italian language. Thanks to Duolingoü§óü§óü§ó. I recommend this app to all who wish to learn foreign languages. But Please Duolingo, also include African languages especially Nigerian languages so one can also learn another national language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I really like it. I'm learning German right now but I tried learning Spanish back then but it was kinda hard but when I tried German it was a lot easier for me to talk. I try to stay motivated to stay on this app and learn but I don't really feel like going on here but I try to stay motivated and be on here everyday just to keep my streak alive. Don't give up and make sure to atleast spend 10 minutes a day on here.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's easy to learn, There are a lot of practices and even the ads for the free version are very short. good for those who need daily practice. I have not tried the paid app and so far the free version works well for me."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This used to be a fun app. But recent changes have stripped it from a learning process to just a word game. Without teaching any aspect of grammar, expect a very stunted learning experience."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love duolingo! I've been using this app for over 400 days in a row! I have been learning Norwegian, Arabic, & Spanish for free. Of all the apps available, this is absolutely one we should all be using every single day. Take advantage of this wonderful app, and give 5 minutes of your time each day to better yourself and learn another language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,My experience on Duolingo is much better than social media because when I am spending my time is social media then my time got wasted and using it fo 2-4 hours but when i heard about Duolingo that i tried it now I got little bit master in korean so I am thankful to all Duolingo team that made this fantastic app but i can't able to app my profile pic because there is no option of it or i can only able to add avatar but didn't like it plz solve this and make my problem solved.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The app works for me. I was able to finish the course in Irish in less than a year. I'm not sure if the knowledge is transferrable to conversation but I feel definitely like I got a good base for it. I'm going to start the Japanese course next.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is recommended for people who want to be productive in their free time. In a way that it is entertaining and educational for students and even for adults. They reward players to manifest satisfactory in their learning phase. While on the basis of streak reward it boosts learners to pursue commitment on the language that players want to learn.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Duolingo for years and am very disappointed at the recent decision to fire 40% of their translation and lesson planning staff in order to more fully lean into cheap AI production for lessons, translations, voice lines, etc. I will be pursuing a refund for my annual subscription."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Charged me $84! My child accidentally subscribed when trying to complete a lesson. Even if we wanted to subscribe, it says $9/mo, not $84!! So expensive!! I thought this app was for poor kids wanting to learn languages who couldn't afford fancy schools & classes. Requesting a refund- if received, will note in rating. We'll see..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"What you did with the league was not necessary! I played those matches because it reminded me of my previous lessons. Now I have to subscribe or spend gems per lesson? No thanks. You have a lot of members to earn money from their subscription, you didn't have to restrict free options. Consider people with low budget in your next update!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's annoying as I use it for Spanish (as my family are canarian) but it's a different Spanish to what they speak. Also the translations are into American English, instead of enllglish, English, which is what I also speak. Also I'm dyslexic and in terms of spelling and learning spellings it's actually not very helpful. But all round an okay app. I'd rather pay for other services that use the Spanish and English that I use than pay for the premium on this app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a great and motivational learning app. And every update is better than the previous. I was hoping to see the gramma in personal achievements, though. She could symbolise 'Page turner'."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What should be an app that allows people to learn how to connect with other people with help from actual people, is now laying off a numerous amount of staff in favor of lazily using AI to teach users languages, which can only lead to issues as AI is not always accurate and isn't as personal as real people who speak these languages guiding learning. I am deeply disappointed and would sincerely hope that this will be a decision that is reversed immediately."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is an amazing app it gives you free lessons you can pay but you don't have to. It also lets you customize your character for your profile. It also gives a milestone counter where it shows you practicing every day and you can do this at anytime on that day just not the next day. Its an amazing app and I think you should try it. It also has TIKTOK if you wanna follow it on there I think you should there content is fun and funny. Anyways go try it I rate it a definite 5 stars
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Started experiencing loss of double bonuss. Example: just opened the chest. Got distracted by a message in another app. Answer quick. Go back to Duo - no more double bonus. Started seeing this recently only, like last day or 2."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I decided to start learning Spanish, when I started duolingo. I started learning pretty quickly, and it was also fun. They used so many different tactics that it really made it stick. duolingo has made learning Spanish fun, easy, and quick."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app froze every time I tried to open it, so I uninstalled and reinstalled it. Now it doesn't recognise my email address as being associated with an account. I pay ¬£89.99 for a family account and have lost 2 days so far."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Doulingo was an amazing app to learn languages years ago, but now it's freaking disappointing and it's not worth to use it, they used to love people learn but now they use every annoying method to earn money from that, from selling stupid hearts to showing annoying ads and stuffs like that, I'm sorry and I'm going to delete it and try other apps."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They'll penalize you for things they'll never actually show you what is wrong or how to correct them other than how to pass the game of the lesson. Correctly spelling out a sentence but for whatever reason getting dinged for not including ""the"" in the English version of a Japanese sentence when it was never brought into previous lessons is wild. Never pay for this."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo gets better all the time. The lessons are well structured, and the ability to test yourself and skip sections if you're already familiar with the language is great"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app. The only problem I've come across is the speaking part. The time you have to speak is too quick. It feels buggy, even though you're saying it correctly. I feel like it's designed to fail, so you're forced to purchase premium."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,By far the best language learning app I've ever used. With the constant reminders to continue my over two hundred and thirty day streak and the competitive leagues I'm never bored learning Dutch! 10/10 would recommend to someone who's casually learning a language.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,very dramatic and makes you feel like you are going to fail your life of you missed a day! very controlling over you and you'll never be the same person ever again trust me it's very harsh on you!!! but it does the trick on keeping you on track and making sure you are doing the right thing all the time. ITS VERY SUPPORTIVE AND AMAZING PICTURE IF YOU DON'T DO IN TIME TRUST ME... hope this review helped you decide if you want to be trapped forever or not and if it will help if you want the app.thx
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Nice application to learn languages, the only option I desire to be added is voice chat with other students after a certain level of progres.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's probably the best language learning app ever, although there's a problem where animations just don't work somehow, every character is just stuck on a pose, and animations add a lot of fun to the app, please fix this."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Was having a great experience learning through Duo and would have continued doing so but their recent push to switch to AI models and simply have human reviewers has made me lose all faith in the apps ability to actually teach a language. If you can't even bother to pay someone to write the lesson, how can you expect us to want to engage with that content or trust it?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo has been going downhill for a while, but recent actions by the company are unacceptable both morally and for the quality of the product. There are plenty of language resources that actually value the contributions of native speakers. Relying on AI translations will only lead to the spread of misinformation."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Hi there, Im learning French right now. I like Duolingo because its very supportive and helps you reach your goals. Also Duolingo makes the learning fun so its not like a chore to do your language practice, more like a treat. But i wish there was a pronunciation level. Keep it up though! üëç"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Word suggestions/auto correct while typing on android keyboards was recently disabled on Duolingo. This is a huge step backwards for accessibility and does not match the real life application of the typing the language.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is definitely something you need if you want to learn another language!!‚ô° I have already learned ALOT from this! you do learn a lot of stuff that isn't quite important, but usually they do give you some things that could help you a lot. Edit: I've been on this app for a year now, and it is AMAZING. You can make your own avatar once you are at a certain spot. You can also make your name whatever you want (mine is...üóø)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's an okay app to learn basics of a foreign language. However, I found unbelivable mistakes in spelling and pronunciation in some lessons. Also, unfortunately it is becoming a very woke app as well."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is okay for the languages it does include, but I was quite dismayed to find that Bulgarian and Thai are not included among the languages it offers. If I want to learn Klingon or High Valyrian, for example, it's got me covered. But an actual language like Bulgarian or Thai? Not so much. Seriously, Duolingo?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It would be helpful if it gave me guidance on what I'm doing wrong. Also would be helpful if there was a way to control how fast or slowly we want Duo to speak. right now, it is either fast or very slow. No opportunity for me to increase in between."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Down to a one star review after they've fired all their translators and replaced them with ai. I've already noticed more mistakes and failures due to this rubbish content. They're also getting rid of smaller languages - duolingo was supposed to support those wholeheartedly, that was something they were proud of. Ridiculous sell out moves."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have the pro version and i am honestly disapointed in how bad it is. The only difference is that it doesn't have ads. could be way better. Bring back offline for pro users and make going through your words not a hassle. Also endless mode!!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's easy to do. yes pronouncing is hard but that happens when learning a new language but it's all set in a way that I like doing it and make sure that I come back on everyday to keep my streak going. Thanks for making this a free way to learn but is also still fun.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love this app, it's making it way easier to learn French by making it into a game of sorts. I've had it less than a month and already starting to see progress in my efforts! Definitely going to use this to learn multiple languages, highly recommend!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Since I started this I have been better in french and it is really great but the only thing is the Internet you always have to use data and that just finishes the data I'm supposed to use for work so pls look into that maybe you can make it that when you reach a particular unit that you don't have to use data again from that unit thank you
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Can only be used as a supplemental learning tool to review basic phrases. Doesn't teach any rules of the language like conjunction. Expects you to learn with trial and error when you can learn 10x more 10x faster with Google and flashcards

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Not only have the courses changed for the worse over the years, now the daily challenges won't even function properly. Don't get invested in this terrible app, if you want to sincerely learn new languages there are plenty of better options out there. I'm deep in the cost sunk fallacy with this horrible app at this point, don't be like me. They fired a good portion of their translating staff in December 2023 in favor of using AI. Terrible company."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,honestly speaking Duolingo is the best app for people who are genuinely curious and astatic towards learning new things so for me it hits right at home and I've recommend it to my entire friend group and I would definitely love to recommend it to anyone else who would like to learn

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My progress is resetting the day after. I'm stuck at section 5, I do one or two practices and the next day I start again from 0. Also, learning a language is getting boring, just doing the same exercises over and over again."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,easy to use and a good mix of *back and forth* between Japanese and English. I also love and appreciate the Hiragana writing so I can start to learn to read Japanese as well - not just speak the words! Very helpful!

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It good but I'm learning Japanese and it put me ahead of what I was capable of so when I try to improve at every day stuff I can't bc it's to difficult on telling what level Iam and after I fail the normal activity I try the practice and it's harder than the activity idk if it's something I did or if it's the app but that sucks and by learning here u basically learn the robotic not casual or dialog that you cant actually use in an every day basis they don't teach u how to talk like a real person
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,They've been clumsily trying to replace their employees with AI and it's become painfully obvious. Horribly messed up voices and nonsensical/incorrect lesson material are making it far more difficult to make any progress. I presume before they had actual humans reviewing this stuff but now they just throw garbage at you. But they probably see all of this as a positive because they want to push you to the stuff that costs money. I.e. no restrictions on mistakes.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I am enjoying studying German on Duo. The app is easy and fun to learn on. However I wish there was some explanation of the how's and why's of grammar or word placement. I sure could benefit by that. I'll have to purchase a German language book in order to find out.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,good app for learning I learnt Japanese and I now know it very well thanks to this app. but one bad thing the super duolingo 12 month subscription asks for more money and it is very expensive but it is good as. The voice is not clear some time.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I prefer learning languages from actual human beings rather than ""AI"". I prefer the errors of human connection over a tool that has been shown to make up answers and are most often trained on stolen, copyrighted works. I'm learning a language to communicate with other human beings. Language is complex and has many different rules and nuance that can't easily be distilled into machine learning code. I want to learn from other human beings fairly compensated for their work and expertise."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,duolingo is a great app to start learning a different language. Although you have to pay to remove ads and get unlimited retries per lesson it's still a great to use because it just like being in a regular class .

Having experience with Duolingo for many years, and having enjoyed learning with it, I am dismayed to find that the app is now promoting the LQBTQ agenda (ex. normalizing/promoting gay/lesbian romantic relationships). It is unfortunate that Duolingo is capitalizing on the lack of competition in this field to promote these ideas. Keep your children away."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've noticed more issues since they fired staff and switched to A.I. There are more problems in the lessons. Like a new word showing up that's a synonym for the actual word being learned in a lesson. Like gracioso (a word that has never showed up before or since) showing up instead of divertido (a word that is regularly in lessons) for fun. The A.I. stinks, hire people."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo used to be fine, but things have gotten worse over time. They recently moved over to machine translation, firing most of their translators - this has reduced quality, and will continue to do so. Doing a review of a machine translation is just normal translation, but for less pay with fewer workers. Mistakes will be inevitable. Other issues too, but this is the one that made me uninstall. Pay your workers, not just your managers."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Is really easy to learn and interactive. German seamed so hard before. Who doesn't want ads, just get the premium. If not, the ads are quite decent, just 10 sec. I like also that you can compete with others which is pretty motivational."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,honestly it's an ok place to start but the more you learn and the more you want to learn it begins to fall flat. There is no place to practice listening to it in a consistent way. for instance if you want to practice spelling or writing characters there is no way to practice them internally
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is amazing. It gives opportunity to those who can't afford the pay course to learn languages. I am so happy to have Duolingo as my learning partner and never hesitate to recommend it to anyone. You are such a tremendous impact to the world
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I miss the old layout of lessons instead of the interface they use now, but I hate the style of every other teaching app like Pimsleur and Babble. Duo is still the best, just bring back the old lesson layout."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It can confuse me sometimes because of how it'll teach a word in hiragana when the word is typically spelled using kanji, then after about a week they introduce the kanji. The app also doesn't have Tagalog, which is disappointing. Other than that, the lessons have been effective for me, so 3 stars."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Like it says, this is definitely the best app to use for learning a new language, whether it's for school/college or just for fun, I highly recommend it since while its quite simple and easy to understand, it still helps you learn."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Match madness last level is impossible to complete unless you pay for boosts. No matter how fast you match the words (with no mistakes), you can't finish it in the required time unless you buy a boost."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My grandma was from Germany which makes her 100% German and my mom 50%, which also makes me 25%. Although I don't have much German in me, I thought it would be interesting to learn German just for fun hopefully one day I would get to go to Germany to use the skill. Duolingo helps me learn quickly, while still making it fun. I love doing my lessons every day and keeping my streak up. I love Duolingo and recommend it for beginners. I recommended it to one of my friends and now she loves it too!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,it is so good and it helps you learn a lot of words and it also helps you talk to people if they speak the language they do and it helps kids learn a lot and for me I am learning Spanish because my family speaks that language and I like my language because it's a different culture and I like being that culture and It helps me a lot and I love it so much so I recommend using Duolingo because it can teach your kids and adults a lot of words and helps you say more things to people
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"this app is very useful because you can learn different languages in it and if you are going out of the country you can install this app to learn a language I'm learning Russian,Japanese,Korean and it is fun to learn because the characters in this app are too much attractive. I'm loving this app You should install and rate too. Thank You Duolingo"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm taking the Japanese course. The listening parts are generally poorly made. Fo example, it's very difficult to differentiate the 'shi' from 'su' through listening even though I know the character to each sound."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really good app, I highly recommend this app for any learners that wants to learn any other languages. But my problem is that it doesn't have a Filipino/tagalog course, I've been struggling with Filipino or tagalog in my class. I halfly know words of it, I really need it to pass classes and communicate or Understand tagalog or Filipino learners. So I try suggesting that you add a Filipino or tagalog course, thank you."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The best language teaching app I've ever come across.....so nice and great in making you understand every single words they bring to ....I so much recommend this app for anyone interested in learning any language in very short period of time , I rate it 20/10 ."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"honestly it's pretty nice, I have to do it for German class at school but I e definitely learned to hear the language and I've been getting better at listening to them but it's not the best with teaching you to speak it since it's robot voices so the pronunciation is a bit messed up on some but id definitely recommend!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"it's good but when it updated it messed up my progress, so now it says I've learned things that I haven't even been taught yet. :/ Also there are a few audio problems that have not been fixed."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Keeps giving me early bird chests at 8pm and night owl chests at 8am. My phone is set to my time zone. This is the only app too dumb to get the time right. Contacted support, no response even when I was paying for the app. Tried all the written help about how to fix. According to them it should be working so the app just has a problem with clocks or something."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"deleting after years of use. it's been getting less user friendly and learning focused for a long time but replacing human translators with ai is really the last straw, ai is not accurate and doesn't understand nuances in language enough to be a good learning resource. sad to see quality sacrificed for bigger profits."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The practice session has been removed. It used to be a good way to revise and score. It's only lessons now. Can bring back the practice sessions tab with listening, speaking, recall and stories."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app. There are many language to choose from. Only complaint is the √©l/ella/usted and ellos/ellas/ustedes forms are sometimes missused in translation. Often, they (ustedes) is translated as you (usted) formal. Otherwise, I'm enjoying relearning spanish"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Helped me rediscover how much I enjoy learning new languages Duolingo is an amazing app, its free, fun and educational. Currently learning French, Indonesian, Arabic and Spanish on the app - great experience so far! Will definitely be recommending to family and friends üòÜ"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Unfortunately, I have sent emails twice to Duolingo and have not gotten a response. My feed shows share on my accomplishments, so I do not receive any congratulations. I assume no one can see anything I do. With this broken??? I am losing the inspiration and support of others."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"best application for learning languages for your phone ever. it keeps you excited, motivated is easy to use and a lot of fun. it almost makes learning languages like playing a video game. 10/10 learning experience"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it's good for introducing you to a language but as you get better this app becomes too easy and doesn't really help with grammar and all of the other important stuff in a language. from what I heard don't only use this to learn a language, read books watch videos and practice."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The game does great job in gamificating language learning. However, If you already know some of the language, it's hard to get to lessons of your level. Would also appreciate if there was option to turn furigana off when learning Japanese"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Dear Duolingo I Really love this app. But there one or two things I like to see improvement on i.e. being able to massage between followers. I was really disappointed when I find out that you can't massage the people you are 'friends' with. And it makes me wonder what's the point of following back if I can't even interract with them. Soo please
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The Duolingo super did NOT specify that it would charge for the whole year and not month to month. VERY misleading. I didn't not want to pay for a FULL YEAR. Other than that the app is fine. The hearts is annoying though.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo helped me finally get into the habit of learning another language after decades of failing to maintain an interest. Super Duolingo is mandatory but well worth the cost when you get into more challenging sections.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"very nice app, studying other languages won't be a problem on this app because it has a very good step by step way of learning i. e, from the alphabet, to phrases to sentences and so on with a test to see how much you understood it. I bet you won't regret ever using the app."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's a fun learning game and is really interactive. I like the languages you can learn and that anyone could use this app. It's not that buggy or glitching out or anything. It's kid friendly and just a great game.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,duolingo is a good platform for learning english. But I dont like the one feature of the duolingo that I we done the incorrect sentence it will deduct the heart and the times the heart will zero and I will have to wait for more than 3 hours so that the heart can regenerate. By the way I rate this app 4/5.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like it so far. The only issue I have is that they suddenly throw you into typing out a translation of words you've never covered before. Most of the time, I have to just retype the English phrase to get it wrong so they can show me what the correct spelling is"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Super fun to use. I am currently learning Mandarin. I was pleasantly surprised that you can learn to write the characters in the app too. A module where you can practice pronunciation would make it even better.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very good,the reminders really try to keep you to do your routine and also very effective and I definitely learned something,but the Duolingo plus,even when it says free trial it still needs my credit card information,but other than it's a very productive app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,an amazing app for learning languages. ot has designed especially for kids . so that they can easily learn any languages by playing. and nobody get bore while using it. I have learned Italian from doulingo . and I am almost learn Italian in only 1 months.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"so much is good. but sometimes i get the feeling it fails you to get you to watch more ads. like when it won't accept a formal translation of 'you' sometimes, and conversely other times won't accept the familiar 'you'. no rhyme or reason. except more ads..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"For some reason in alphabet lessons, it's started giving me these words with –π in them, which in English is an i with a semi circle on top. But I can't find that I anywhere. I've gone to a website and copy pasted that i but it was the capital version of it so it was not accepted. And the fact that you have to complete the lesson you messed up on or it won't let you complete the lesson, I'm not being able to progress or learn the alphabet anymore. Here's the i that I used that wasnt accepted : ·øò"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"handy to do 15 mins a day and pick up where you left the day before. I like the ""correct your mistakes"" as it seems to stick in my memory. plus like how they give you the words to choose from then later you have to remember them with no assistance."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Duolingo was great until it removed the lesson/course download functions. Now I'm not sure why I pay for premium. I'm constantly travelling and often have no internet on long flights. Would be great to have the option back.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I LOVE THE APP but one of my suggestions is that you make the ""match madness"" a lil bit easier. I'm learning German so it's extremely hard for me to the point, that I stay up till 3am just to beat it. To hundreds of unsuccessful tries I finally decided that I will be left with only two stars. Over all good content keep it up. Also just so you know I recommended it to all my friends and family. Love, Master Oogway"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great free version features while providing an even better learning experience through a subscription. While I certainly have some grits about it, it does seem to teach languages quite well."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The experience is meaningful I am enjoying the journey learning how to better communicate with others . The lessons and vocabulary are very useful in my daily communication.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Hey team, can you add functionality where the user can choose how to continue the course I.e options from the list of writing, speaking, or forming sentences from the recommendation? In busy schedules sometimes it's hard to either speak or write... hope you will consider and add to your backlog üòÉüòÉ"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"homosexual and woke content is being taught here. seems that they want you to keep using this app without completing it, with their streak goals. aim to bring your learning to an end goal. dont just keep using it to maintain some rank, etc."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love how it's free and has so little ads. plus you get so many lessons for free you can praticly become an expert. plus the paid version looks really good. I am yet to try it but I would recommend.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Fun learning app. I've been on it for years and still enjoy it. I've been trying to change the avatar on my profile to a picture of me but can't seem to find any feature or button for that. I have deleted and reinstalled the app but to no avail. I hope this can be fixed.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app has an expensive subscription and annoying ads if you don't get the subscription, but it is also the only app that I have found that can successfully teach me. Very good language learning app over all, I like this app very much."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoy this as a simple learning tool, however the lack of a British English option is pretty annoying.. I've never played soccer, I've never experienced this thing called ""fall"" in Autumn. Always catching me out!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm really enjoying this app, the vibrant colors, combo of reading, writing & saying. Some of the exercises seem repetitive but I understand that's meant to reinforce what I'm learning. Thank you Duolingo team!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Can be very intense, if you want. But, you will learn at a very quick pace. Very well done system of learning with great reviews to make sure you stay fresh on past lessons. Veldig god!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"When I started having dreams involving other languages, I knew it was working. I have used both the free and paid versions and have enjoyed both. I enjoy the paid version more since I am truly dedicated to learning a new language. it's not for everyone, but has been great for me."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"duolingo has come SO far in the last 5 years. There content delivery has become so engaging and varied, and it's engaging enough to keep me from doomscrolling for a while. ...That owl feels like a scary ex though... Highly recommend!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It had been working well. And now all of a sudden ad music comes between lessons whenever i open the app and take my lessons. Its a total disturbance. I thought it was of not updated and checked no change. I kept restarting the app but there no change in the background ad music
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I have been using the app for a while to grasp basic communication prior to a trip (usually a marathon) with great results. Some suggestions (knowing that a business still needs to be run): a perfect lesson should give a ‚ù§Ô∏è for example
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Cool way to learn other languages. Feels more like a game which helps. I can imagine it being difficult to become fluent in your chosen language but you can definitely learn enough to survive in the respective country
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Good for learning words. Sucks teaching grammar. Generally limited explanations given (lesson notes and tips could provide much more depth). It would be much better if it gave the reason for the correct answers when you fix your mistakes.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a pleasant app for learning new words, sentences but the thing that they should try to install the feature to gain more hearts without practising the whole thing again.Secondly they should add more languages and many more fun activities that would be awesome too"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great for learning. Builds on what you learn. Also teaches the symbols, which is very important for getting around. Great so far. Almost through the rookie level. Loving it so far!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good but has lots of room for improvement, especially because of the expensive price they charge. it could have more features under a premium account. maybe videos, movie scenes, etc"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Generally an enjoyable app which allows unlimited review of past lessons,however if you cannot connect to WiFi every day, off line activity is seriously limited & not credited later.. I frequently travel in areas without WiFi access ). Despite this, I recommend as an enjoyable learning tool"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is great, it's fun, learn with learners but with the widget, it bugs like it doesn't tell you when you didn't play it just stays with the happy duolingo, so many times I've been fooled, thinking I did it but actually no, oh and same thing when I go in the app, it doesn't tell me I didn't play it, it had mess up my streak, luckily I had diamonds."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I'm multilingual and already fluent in 5 languages so I actually just wanted to se how it works and tackle my 6th language and a tough one at that I chose to learn Chinese and the way it's designed is absolutely brilliant reminds me of a language learning software called biki express similar you read it hear it and I recommend get a pen and paper and write it with every lesson and I promise within 3 months you can speak it in my case a have a talent for languages I'll be fluent in Chinese
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am learning Japanese from this app. My brother is also learning Japanese. I like this app so much. We can learn any language by playing games in Duolingo. It is a very fun method/way to learn any language. If I ask anyone how did they learn different languages, they will say that they learned it from Duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"With each update, the app and the desktop version are less and less usable. It has gone from my go to app to me, maybe opening it once a month. It's obvious Duolingo really isn't interested in its users"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The nice thing with douling is that it reaffirms words with not just sound and repitition but using the characters/letters of the language you're trying to learn, so you're also learning to read and write as well."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Can't believe no one is mentioned how rigged competition part of app is. It's almost impossible to maintain 1rst place after silver league. Explain to me how I could be #1 with 50-65 points ahead of person at #2 spot then after 1 lesson I come back and person at number #2 is 400+ points ahead of me, that's not even possible...? Pressure you into paying."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It has really helped me learn Spanish, I am dyslexic and really struggled learning languages through school. However when I got recommended Duolingo it turned out to be the best learning platform I have tried. I can almost speak in fluent Spanish and I adore Duolingo!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is great, i guess. Back then beifre they changed the lingots into gems, lessons were free. Now, you have to pay for hearts and lessons and extras like match madness and ramp-up. And they expect us to buy super Duolingo ""for free"". Everything's so expensive (in gems)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I may have been here since the start. I feel like the learning style and the ways of teaching are changed every update.Which seems to be based on making money, and not strictly on providing information. That being said, I enjoy this app and find it fun all this time later."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very bad experience. After finishing a level, it says you will have 2X points for 15 minutes, but a lot of times, after the announcement that you have 2x, it doesn't give you anymore. I don't know if that's a bug, but that's very annoying. The stories are only with lesbians and gay people. In these days, to be straight, it is something weird. Are you owned by Netflix or smth? And, of course, the characters are muslims, algerians, etc. What is that European? We have to be politically correct."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have been using the app for about five years now, and I'm even using the premium version. I am disappointed that I don't have the option to complete friends quests, even though I wrote to the support twice already. I am looking for a way to fix this."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I like the experience this app gives you. Balanced challenges but keeps your interest high. You can use the free version without problem although sometimes the ads are annoying.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Lovely app, but speaking exercises don't work on Android mobile, microphone enabled. Reading exercises starting to repeat, and so do the exercises focusing on previous errors, I'm asked to practice same 4 or 5 words over and over."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"generally quite good, encourages regular practice. A bit buggy, I frequently have to force stop and try again at the start of a session. Some of the English is totally incorrect."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I turned off notifications. I do not care for the daily reminders and some reminders are a bit rude. I'm on a 19 day streak and the notification honestly made me not want to use the app. It's not as cute as you think it is FYI.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Lately the app is very slow, and gets stuck a lot. Since you give double points for only 15 minutes, it is very annoying. Before, the app ran smoothly and I learned a lot."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The way this app is designed is really good, you get to see your progress in vibrant colors and not some boring layout. I also love the characters they have plus the language model they've designed to learn any language well."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's good for learning a new language, but I'm not a big fan of the hearts. It used to be a five star app, but after they introduced super duolingo, you would have to pay extra to optimize your learning. I wouldn't recommend it if you have zero patience like me."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Over the past several months, Duolingo has just been making the app worse and worse still. They even announced they are no longer updating welsh! With a new focus on ai over ACTUAL PEOPLE, Duolingo has fallen to ruin. The app has turned into constant ads, constant begging to buy 'Duolingo plus', and now it seems would prefer money in their pockets over a staff made up of real humans. Don't download this profit-hungry app!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"interesting way to learn for free with varying graphics, context and learning presentation. I've been using for almost 18 months with no issues. would highly recommend."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Paid super. Has an annoying bug that keeps recurring where you can't put answers in. This makes it so you can't finish lessons so you just waste time. Super annoying and often game breaking.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My husband and I are paid members. Unfortunately our memberships renewed the end of December; If I'd known Duolingo laid off actual human translators in favor of AI I never would have renewed. This is a poor decision. Having used AI translate and seeing how iffy it is, I'm now wondering if I will be able to trust the Japanese lessons I am getting. The human suffering factor is crucial; knowing Duolingo chose profits over a good product w/ good people is disgusting. Will not recommend."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"In the initial stages, the app effectively introduces Arabic alphabets and their pronunciation‚Äîa crucial foundation for those unfamiliar with them. However, for individuals versed in Urdu or Persian (sharing the same alphabets as Arabic), the repetitive alphabet drills across levels can be tedious, diminishing the app's appeal. A solution to cater to diverse language backgrounds would enhance user engagement and prevent redundancy. I will give it a 5 star if you guys fix that! Thank you!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is ok but i cant mute it from saying the text i can already speak russian im trying to learn how to read but i cant because it says the words so i instantly know what it is without having to read it also the progression is too slow and the words are too repetitive i shouldn't be matching the same words for 8 lessons in a row its just dragging it out to increase ad revenue because of how long you have to use it actually learn more that the same 20 words
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app, I'm on unit 4, and I've learnt a lot like I went to France last week, and I knew the base words and phrases. Thank you, duolingo. if you are learning a new language I recommend as it has speaking reading and writing.(btw I'm learning French)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"really enjoying using Duolingo to learn German! Exercises are fun and it seems like we are picking up the language. we got the paid version right off the bat, so there are no limitations on learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Honestly this app is such a freaking money grab. They make it next to impossible to actually learn a language with spending money in their app. They show you a billion ads for their stupid premium feature, and if you make more than 5 mistakes, you're screwed and - oh well no more learning for you. Plus the 3 star exercises with the people - they make them crazy freaking hard, and almost literally impossible to complete without dumping gems for their timer boosts, which you almost certainly need."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It is the most successful learning tool I ever experienced. It is simple but direct and the repetitive statements and questions aid in learning and makes it easy to learn the new language. I can't wait to start learning French next year.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I started Duolingo less than a week ago & after the 1st lesson, I was so impressed that I became a paid subscriber. I'm 9 months into using Babbel, another excellent course, but Duolingo as a daily refresher helps me retain what I learn over time with Babbel. I use Duolingo each morn & Babbel each evening. Frankly, Duolingo is more fun & I spend more time using Duolingo (30-60 minutes) than Babbel. I love this language program & glad I found Duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Cash grab app honestly. The ads are justifiable, but the 5 hearts? How greedy are you people? If you want to make it a paid app, then just do it. Only 5 mistakes a day and then you have to pay? Add to that the grammar mistakes reported by everyone else, the degrading experience with subsequent updates and complete silence when you want to contact support. This app isn't worth the time it takes to learn to say ""bugger off"" in the language you're trying to learn."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,A good app to learn words and easy conversational skills. Not great at explaining sentance structures. A year in and I still would not know how to carry on a full conversation.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a really good app, so far it has been helpful. Only critique I have is that sometimes the audios for the words/sentences are a bit hard to make out. Otherwise it's pretty good. üëç"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"A great starting point to a language. But it can too repetitive, and sometimes feels likes it not progressing. It's asked me the French word for croissant way too many times..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Speaking into the app does not work. I pay for Duolingo super, but am missing a huge part of what I payed for because when I tap OR hold the ""press to speak"" button, it ends and says try again before I get to speak."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's a good app I mean it asks you exactlly what you want to learn and how good you are at that language so it knows how to help you. It's even free for normal lesons. If you want something better than normal there's an extra trial too! Even though you have to pay for it that's normal and still doesn't change my rating of 5 stars
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a good app. I just wish they hadn't removed the option to ask questions about grammar etc, that was very helpful. Also with the sentences maybe putting something on it to indicate the dialect would be good?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I think this app is a good way to learn some vocabulary. It would be great if rules to the language were explained more. Also, differentiating between formal and informal would help us in being more conversational."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love duolingo and have now updated to super duolingo. The only problem I have is that every morning when I open the app it locks up and I have to force stop and restart before I can do any lessons.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is nice, i like it. It is easy to use and to keep track of. But the problem is I cannot make my own account. For some reason it won't allow me to continue from the first stage of making my account. Its always ""Please enter a vaild phone number"" But whenever I enter, It won't accept."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love using Duolingo! I have been using it for years to learn Chinese and refresh on Spanish. I use the paid version because the free version's ads make learning more challenging than it has to be - but not impossible. Most importantly, learning a language requires patience, perseverance, and practice. You get out of it what you put into it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm giving this 5 stars for now. I'm only using the free version so far and the lessons are fun. I can imagine a young mind learning a lot with this app. There are some ads, which is expected for using it for free, but so far, not many."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I learned so much English this year. With the app, duolingo and I learned some new words today in the afternoon. This is a good app for learning language. And I really like it. Because I learn English French in Spanish. So this is a good app app, and thank you to Olivia. To let me learn more language. Thank you for asking me."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo, a language-learning platform, has revolutionized how we acquire new languages. Its user-friendly interface, gamified approach, and accessibility make it a standout tool. From bite-sized lessons to engaging exercises, Duolingo empowers learners, breaking down language barriers and fostering a global community of language enthusiasts."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is unbelievable how fast and easy Duolingo makes language learning. School language classes are full of busywork, while this app does the job in a better way. Addicting too, and I love it!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love how the app is build like a game, it makes it so fun to learn. I'm learning Japanese right now and I already know the basics of ordering food like rice and sushi. It could be cool if there was a way to wright down the words to learn the words faster, but that's not really necessary. Love it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I added a the flame badge to my app The app restarted now I can't turn off the music that's playing in the background of the app. I deleted and redownloaded and the same music keeps playing over the lessons. Need option to turn off that music
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,2024 update: now you can't even practice unlimited anymore. If you don't have super this app is basically worthless now and Duolingo DOES NOT CARE. They are happy to ruin their platform and take your money. Literally anything else is better at this point. Hearts system is antithetical to learning. I no longer can learn with this app due to how frustrated I am at having such limited attempts before having to start the entire lesson over again. Pay walling success is gross.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"App doesn't always load. I have to uninstall / reinstall to get it to work. Then it works a couple of times. Then: uninstall, install, etc. Android phone, works well. What's wrong?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Program appears to be great. Wish there was somehow simpler ways to further learn with words that we may select and the program can sound it out for us. What does bother me is I don't get any of the ""Friend Quests"" to participate with a friend nor do I have any options for it, but my wife completely has this. WHY??????"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"There was a time that Duolingo was a good app - however, this has now ended. In December 2023, Duolingo fired dozens of staff to replace them with AI. Those who remain are now simply AI reviewers. Don't use this app - use other language apps who actually support human learning and don't resort to cheap cheating tricks for the mere sake of profit."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"free is great, sometimes youll get a brief super without paying, without signing up.. the circular learning is amazing, try this for 15 minutes and youll be hooked on a new language. free gems from ads and quest rewards plus leaderboards make it competitively fun as you learn at your own pace. on free im learning spanish, german, arabic, gaelic, and english all at the same time, constantly customized to me and my needs and my pace. get it now! feb 2024"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Some words change. Banana was banana the first few lessons, then changed to plantana. Repetitive nonsense about shoes & tee shirts. I hoped to learn words & phrases for travel, but..nothing. Repeating words is no use when there is very little emphasis on understanding what is spoken. What is the point of learning to speak a language when there is minimal instruction on understanding what others are saying?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great work! It would be more helpful if there is a side track where I can learn just few words and sentences enough to navigate through day to day circumstances.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Using the premium version where they give you a contact email for premium users. Emailed them 3 times over the past months: a suggestion, a bug and a user interface problem. All of these emails stay unanswered"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Paid for year of Duolingo super to do an Italian course and after a few months they removed the course. They make it practically impossible to contact them and still haven't responded to me when I did eventually find a way.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Got the paid premium to avoid ads. Love everything about it, the interface, technology, personalization, repeated practice, combination of reading, writing, speaking, and listening."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I wouldn't use it as a standalone learning tool, the way it dives right into lessons is kinda confusing, but it is a fantastic asset. I would love to see speaking lessons added for Japanese."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Awesome app to use. I've just started the German language and can remember some phrases and I've only been doing it for like 5 days. 4 stars because the ads are a bit annoying for like duo+ or something and I keep finding green feathers and threatening notes.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Why hasn't the drag and drop bubble feature been developed for Android yet? I have been using this application for long enough to remember that the iPhone 5 had this feature on the iOS side. There is still no change after 8 years. üëø
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Stopped playing for a few months, came back and lost my progress, friends, achievements, everything. Now I can't log into that account, it only recognized this new iteration of ""me."""
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,New vertical course system is horrible. The app starts freezing on medium-end phone even with animations turned off. No app at the playstore behaved like this to me before. I much more prefer anki method.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've used this app for years and the quality has only gotten worse over time. Now they've laid off human translators in favor of AI translation - and since they got rid of the discussion feature, users who don't know any better won't notice the nonsense translations because nobody can leave comments pointing them out. Using AI to teach a language is stupid and a waste of everyone's time - you'd be better off trying to teach yourself using Google Translate. Don't waste your time or money."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it has been fun, I am using English to learn Italian when Spanish is my native language. I like the competition between learners and the way it is set up it is easy to keep going and learn in a fun way. so far, I highly recommend Duolingo"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is like a teacher who really wants you to learn the language. It focuses on your weak areas more. 10 out of 10. would recommend. PS: You won't even feel annoyed when it shows you ads.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is quite fun and intuitive for learning basics. I feel like I could learn better and faster if there was more explanations on correcting errors and more conversation style techniques
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"At first I used to lingo free version because I didn't want to rush through the course and not learn the language. But after a year and a 1/2 I decided to buy the page version so that I could just keep going. Because I'm learning more now. In fact, I use my language. Which is Spanish everyday at work. I live in a predominantly Spanish-speaking town. Anne. A lot of the co-workers that are Spanish. Do not speak Spanish. So I helped the customer and use my Spanish and together. They're little bit"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Update 01/04/24 Issue below still happening, and NO ONE has responded to my requests for help.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"learning Japanese, it's fun without the ads, and engsging and what it does trach you sticks even if it feels a bit slow sometimes. I have heard that it is a bit sort of old/jarring/formal to native Japanese speakers though"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When I finish certain amount of lessons, duolingo starts playing a song. When I'm in a new lesson or quit the app, it plays forever. I have to force stop the app to stop the annoying random song..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing language learning app. The hearts are stupid, but they need to make money somehow. Not a lot of ads, and Super Duolingo is given to you for free every few months. The world needs more people like the team at Duolingo"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app to study Japanese for 900 days now. I've never missed a day and have met every single monthly goal, yet whenever I try to listen to or read Japanese outside of the app I STILL can't even get a vague grasp of it. I'm done. I'm not going to keep devoting time to this app if I still have nothing to show for it even after trying so hard for so long. 900 days and I feel like I've barely learned a thing and have no faith that things will get better. Time to look elsewhere."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall good, but NOT a one stop solution for any language. For example, learning Korean alphabet is perfect on Duolingo, but for everything else I use other apps. Ads are getting more annoying here too."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really good! Can I suggest that maybe there are some downloadable lessons, so even if you have run out of streak freezes or want to do a lesson, but have no signal, you can? If it had that feature, I would give it 5 stars."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is fun, but sometimes it doesn't focus on the main part of the language. Basically you just learn some sentences that are irrelevant. And the worst part is the freezing of streaks."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"doulingo is one and only platform for learning a language which I'm rating 5* ,it's because of algorithms of this app is not made by just normal people,some highly intelligent people worked hard to make it. even if it shows ads I have no problem with it ,and if you are really committed to learning,doulingo also give you surprise by giving you 3 days ads free service which is really great. I have learn so much from here in my 17 day, streak keeps me angeging to learn here thank you Team doulingo"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App was great until they laid off a bunch of staff to use ai instead. Lots of bugs are popping up now not sure if they also fired some developers and the use of AI is really creepy and feels really inauthentic, I'll be switching to another language app to continue learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is the best french teaching option. I learnt a lot in french. I'm optimistic and very much appreciate this program. Thanks to Duolingo. For you to read and speak french, Duolingo is the best program. Their tutorials are very much interactive, therefore go in for Duolingo to be able to communicate in french. Merci beaucoup Duolingo."

We practices different words by listening,writing and matching the same words.If you are curious to go in different countries you learn much from here. It is great opportunity"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am so incredibly disappointed in duolingo. laying off half your teams before the holidays is bad enough but all this nonsense with AI has got to stop. It's not even AI, it's machine learning. when you are a source for endangered languages, you NEED to have real people there to translate! it has become abundantly clear that duolingo no longer cares about spreading knowledge and learning. we have lost yet another company that could have been great but now, they only care about money. uninstall."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Recent update: Sometimes this really annoying music starts playing randomly and there's no way to turn it off without closing the app. It ruins the experience because I can't hear the speech, which destroys the point of the app. Please fix!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Please fix the music bug multiple people are having. It's driving me crazy. Takes away *a lot* from the experience and I've noticed I make more mistakes because I can't focus
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"it's a good way to learn if you don't get caught up in chasing status in the leagues. the biggest issue I have is with its non-existent customer service. I pay for super duo, the app won't let me login without directing me to a new sign-up; effectively stealing money from me while my streak dies. there is absolutely nothing I can do about it: my emails are completely ignored. very awful people run this app. filed complaint with BBB, duolingo rep lied and offered no help"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is supposed to be a fun learning app, not a game where you get passively made fun of every time you lose, even though you got the answer right. The app is gaslighting people. Not to mention, there was a hacker that stopped me from getting 1st place, having 3000+xp within the first 2 days, I reported them, and they never got banned. ü§™ü§°üôâ I really wanted to leave 5-stars for how much I've learned and have kept forgetting to because of how fun it was, but this is insane! Please fix so I can."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Having to pay if you are losing hearts is quite misleading. The whole app learning doesn't let you improve and learn from mistakes. Instead find yourself trying to play and earn hearts/lives to carry on with further study.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm still learning, but so far in the language I'v been learning I have been doing very well speeking the language, and I can tell what words are being shown in the other language! Duolingo is a great app to try to learn different languages, even some of the most hard ones to learn!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"PLEASE for #'s sake stop being ABLEIST! Trick words in the answers that have just one ending letter different or are extremely similar in looks & count as wrong even though it's the translation and the meaning is obviously right. Japanese not having clear pronunciation on new kanji-words (ËÉåÂ∫É ?!) half of the time and NO written pronunciation when you click on the word, something that they HAD in the beginning. You keep making it worse for neurodiverse and hard-of-hearing people!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to be one the my favourite apps for language learning.

I started thinking I wouldn't last because I can never stick to things but I've been doing a lesson everyday for a whole year now, going to cafes to get Internet and still doing it while at festivals!!! the streak gives me motivation to not let it drop and I have learned so much subtly doing a bit every day!!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,the animations are so good and the different characters and they all have unique personalities and they show in their voices. this app is incredible! (i can't wait for the never ending pursuit of growth by execs to ruin it üò¨)
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I just started using Duolingo yesterday. The experience is already thrilling and instructive. This is highly recommended for anyone who wants to learn a language (most languages are available on the app).
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Although the lessons in sentence structuring is there, sometimes the sentences are not logical in the Spanish lessons, for example: El gato Barriga es mi amigo. √âl es cubano y quiere ser camarero en un restaurante en Espa√±a. (The cat, Barriga, is my friend. He is Cuban and wants to be a waiter at a restaurant in Spain). It's a CAT! I don't know about other people, but I wouldn't order the salmon in Spain - kitty will be picking off your plate and serving cat hair instead of fish. üòÖ"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"If you ignore the league gamification feature, and just focus on the streak, it's a good motivator to practice daily. I can now read the labels of Japanese grocery items simply by using Duolingo on a daily basis."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"i used to love this app, but it's gotten more scattered and less educational as time goes on, and this will only get worse with the addition of ai to courses. over the past few updates, i haven't felt like i'm learning anything anymore"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"At the time of writing I'm at a 1536 day streak. The application is wonderful. It has lots of fun options to learn and improve our knowledge in languages. However, their recent actions cannot go unnoticed. Firing their staff in favor of AI is not acceptable. I will gladly change my review to a 5 star if they change back to a more human staff AND start a family plan. Please make the corrections for the betterment of humanity."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great way to learn! The only thing that would make it better would be way to just listen and speak when you wanted to. I have over an hour drive to work and would love to just listen and speak as a practice without touching my phone. I'd be able to do 2 hours of that every day.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,it's really helpful to learn I'm learning Japanese and German and it is super helpful and I'm learning a lot!

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent app for especially students...From this app one would learn perfect pronunciation as well as how to write a single letter. It also help us out how to construct word, Sentences from the basic level-a single letter.. Perfect App"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's actually really good! The sessions or sections are pretty good, and teach phrases and words that you'd actually use in said language. It's organized and very easy to use. It literally ate"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"App should include more details of the grammar rules and how and when to apply them. More help is also needed with the pronunciation of difficult words. Not enough time is allowed with the ""speak"" lessons.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A fun way to learn a language at a basic level. My family and I are enjoying learning together. I don't appreciate that sometimes there are advertisements back to back, but so far we have the free version so I guess it's expected."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm so sick of this app and I'm tempted to delete it, not giving af about my streak anymore. The problem : the asked me to put ""the photo"" but in spanish. The correct answer is el foto. No duolingo saying it's ""el retrato"" WHICH MEANS THE PORTRAIT! It's not the same thing. If you wanted me to translate ""the portrait"" you should've put that. I'm losing hearts for something that I shouldn't be losing hearts for and I'm sick of it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo has made the unfortunate decision to replace its contracted human translators with AI. I am not interested in learning a language via lesson plans assembled by AI. I no longer trust what Duo teaches me to be accurate or natural, and its incredibly disappointing that they would replace people's livelihoods, years of work, with inferior AI. Shame on Duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Was enjoying the app a lot and decided to go for duo super. It was advertised as a monthly amount when it's actually the full year up front. Would've never signed up for it if I knew it'd be the full year at once
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! It helps learning a new language so much easier. However, it can be annoying when you run out of hearts and have to redo your lesson. But overall, a great app!! I 100% recommend!!!"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"this app is actually way better than I imagined, it seems like mist learning apps, the ones that have a bunch of adds to upgrade or to play a game but duolingo only ever advertises other parts of the app. duos tiktok page is also unhinged as hell its so funny."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It was fun at first but now its just really repetitive. I have been using this for nearly 100 days. I haven't really learned much with the 6 lessons a day I did. I find it hard to retain information. Plus the 5 lives doesn't help. I'm constantly wondering if I'm getting it right.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's a very helpful and well-designed education app for me. It's designed as fun as a game. I enjoy learning English with Duolingo and I don't feel any stress during the learning process. Just have fun.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Something is wrong with speaking tasks when recording my voice is required ... it always cuts mid-way and refuses my answer. I checked that the app has all the right permissios and it used to work fine.

I might not have had it long, but I have a 12 day streak and I'm so proud of myself because I'm always busy, especially with school. but there is a tiny problem, the wifi. it'd be nice to have a language learning app where I didnt have to use internet. I'm not sure, but I feel a few more people feel the same way, especially if they don't have internet."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When I was on the free version of Duolingo, there was a great learning tool from the community. If I didn't understand or made an error, I could click and see what the community wrote. Within a scroll or two I had a great explanation. I was happy for I bought a family account. Now that I am paying every month, they removed their learning tool. I am debating leaving them entirely at this point. They also have no way to contact them in the ap and voice my opinion so I'm writing it here."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,im a new comer in this and I don't know more about this and I was studying german language and per days we can learn lots of word in that language And also this app was absolutely free thats the main adventge and we all can easily study whatever the language is. this app was really helpfull to me and im proud to be as a student duolingo thank you duolingo
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pretty slay in learning languages, not too difficult, and it makes sure you know your stuff before moving to the next unit. Ads are alot sometimes tho but not too bad."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app, it will definitely make me achieve my goals, I would've given 5 stars if not for these problems; right now animations are not playing, and another problem is in my french course, my french level is way higher than what the app chose for me."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been pleasantly surprised by how comprehensive it is so far. It gives you tools to tackle learning in different ways and, though there are some areas that are unintuitive, it's largely a good way to approach learning"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Too many intrusive reminders, leader board algorithm are frustrating. Currently,I dislike your fight club motivation reminders. This was once an awesome app. Everyone one will soon see..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Frustrating on two counts.... first the fact that you only get five lives and if you make five mistakes you cannot continue learning without watching even more ads or waiting many hours. Second the constant adverts at the end of every lesson. *sarcastic mode on* Surprise surprise you can get unlimited lives and less adverts by paying for the premium service. *sarcastic mode off*
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. It's easy to understand and you can go at your own pace. I wish it would explain more when you make a mistake. Let me know why it's wrong and so I can learn. I also don't agree on the timed lessons, there is no way you could spell certain words in the short amount of time. I think when you do a timed lesson that the spelling of words weren't included."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I am very mad at Duolingo right now, I can't do a lesson to continue my streak because I don't have any hearts and my streak will restart in 30 minutes I have repeatedly messed up all throughout the day and keep on losing hearts so there is no way I can just wait to get more. Also I already used a streak freeze yesterday so I can't use another to save it"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I think that this has to be the most useful app I've ever had at first I was just doing it for school and when my parents told me to now that school pushing it more I've started doing it more and have actually gotten better I want to do it just cause I can I get a bit frustrated doing it but I have improved in Spanish more than I thought I could with fun characters that I love and it tells you what the right answer is to help you improve when you make mistakes
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Systematic enough for me to be able to follow and progress, interesting enough with its anecdotes, helpful tips and matching pair games to keep me on course. A good teaching course."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"To be honest the app would be great way to learn and practice a language if only it would not push you to pay the freaking subscription. I really detest the heart system considering that half of the time the app can't recognize what you're saying no matter how many times you repeat and how clearly you say the words... Not sure if want to pay the money and keep yelling at my phone ""Elles mangent l√®s croissants!!! BIT&#!!!"""
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Really great app,I have learned more on duolingo than on any other app. It is literally free and you don't have to upgrade to premium if you don't want to and there are little to no ads on this app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duo helped me learn Spanish, Korean, French, and Japanese within half a year, and that's because I was learning four languages. It takes about a month to start seeing fluent results for one language. I recommend learning Spanish because it's easy and if you live in the U.S, it will be helpful. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is the perfect app for learning languages we'll I have my own mean to learn language but still there are problems here if we the system to search language by typing than that will be more helpful to search languages and the premium that is not good but owner also needs income some how right if they added the the thing i mentioned than I will give 5 out of 5 stars
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is where learning becomes a habit , it is a really good tutoring app for everyone including kids and elders . üòÄü§©üòöüòÅ * One suggestion for me is its good if you get a reminder ( notification) on streaks"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New one! Played 30 mins and no points! My score stayed put probably b/c I didnt buy cheats. LAWSUIT TIME. NOT FREE, it is RIPOFF NOW. Updates DRAIN$$$$$. NO LONGER TEACHES MUCH BUT TRICKS/ TRAPS PPL INTO ~$60+/wk+ (tried it) if u earned level u want to keep. Discriminating (if bad eyesight or slow hand prbs, U will never place rank unless lots of $). If device is slower, U WILL PAY MORE. & U have to subscribe to be allowed to repeat rank. New lesson style=$$$ only/NO learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I paid for the yearly subscription and 2 days later. it's announced that 70% of staff was laid off in favor of ai tutoring. This is extremely disappointing knowing my money is going to the investors instead of the staff that built the technology for learning.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This can be challenging as you want. There are many ways that the language is reviewed, by speaking, entering endings, typing out the words and listening and repeating."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo makes a new language very achievable. I do wish the subject matter had more that is applicable to a tourist as I don't find conversations about roommates, neighbors or ones' profession, for example, to be relevant."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great way to learn foreign language! Yes, there are ads popping up after a lesson, but it's for free and it's really amazing that you can have such a great learning platform (or app) for free. I really love it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Quite irritating when speaking exercises are disabled in profile but the app periodically asking to complete speaking task or speaking quest. And that black screen of death when nothing is displayed and nothing you can do happens really too often.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The gamifying aspect of the app makes that one spend more time farming points than actually learning, also the total focus on competitive rather than collaborative. They are not giving education for free, there is big money between subscriptions or ads"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's fun to use, but I wish it gave the grammer rules in a readable format you could learn and memorize instead of forcing trial and error, many times without explanation of exceptions."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The lessons take around a minute and then you are forced to watch an ad. It use to not be this bad before. Now it feels like one of those scammy games that forces you to watch an ad for anything you do. It discourages me from even opening duolingo anymore I'd rather learn from other sources at this point.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,As an app(technicall issue): sometimes when loading content for nect lesson it freezes and i need to restart app. Beside that great app. It does not take that much battery while running.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was automatically deducted for the subscription and it was my fault that I did not read the terms and conditions before proceeding with the free trial at first. Fortunately, they were able to refund it back to me as soon as I have requested of it. Thank you and kudos for the fast refund!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,After a recent update all my daily progress keeps getting reset so I have to redo the same lessons. Please fix this I really enjoyed the app before this happened. I've tried using the computer and uninstalled and reinstalled the app.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I think this is a really fun way to help your kids learn different languages. it is a fun and educational way to learn different languages. and if the problem is hard, Duolingo encourages the kids and it is probably a little better than Google translate."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have being using duolingo for so long now, not just me also my friends and cousins, but all in sudden we start hearing this annoying music played on the background, i don't know why or how... And we couldn't stop it from playing... Please fix it soon"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,duolingo really helps you in any kinds of language that you want to learn and its fun using this app its also friendly app where even a kid can learn easily on different languages. Thank you duolingo for the oppurtunity of learning new kind of languages.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"About 6 years ago, a coworker told me about Duolingo & I've been using the app ever since. It's fun and very interactive. I had my kids download the app and now they're using it for their foreign language classes. I love it!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I would rate it with 5 stars but you have to pay and or watch ads to gain more hearts to keep going. I would pay but paying is way too over priced. Otherwise this is a great app and tool to learn new languages.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"love this app! it tests from varying levels even if you say you know nothing cos they know the human brain has it's own opinion on what YOU think u know. I'm a native Spanish speaker (from Ecuadorian parents) i grew up in NYC but really only know English these days, esp after several years in Australia. I've decided to try German cos I just love it, everything about it actually, and suddenly I'm ""fluent""??? Had no idea how much German I'd picked up from friends and colleagues over the years‚ù£Ô∏è"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Duolingo it's the best learning app there is! I would 100% download right now!

(duo I did what you asked for let my family go back home) have fun learning! *ps! over 100 languages to learn!*"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It works you can learn a ton of languages with just a few minutes of your day. They are committed to their service even if you choose the free version. I respect that they provide the service and should be compensated so I don't mind commercials. Thank you I appreciate it!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,learning Spanish is really easy to do! You can pick your own language to learn. There are easy lessons and stages to do. I would personally recommend Duolingo to any person that wants to learn a new language!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Best platform to learn a language. It's engaging and makes you committed to learn. After an update in February 2024, it's frequently offline and affecting my learning progress. Fix it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Fun app that makes learning a new language into a game, but I really miss the comunity page. Especially when you get further into the course it was so usefull to read the explanations when you made a misstake. Please bring it back Duolingo!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's great but I want to learn Portuguese and it says boom ur learning Portuguese but it's not Portuguese it's Brazilian Portuguese. So basically Portuguese but all the pronunciations are wrong and all sorts of other stuff, Duo please let me learn what you say I am learning. Thanks. Edit: duo I'm sorry I saw you out my window last night I love you 10/10 üòüüôè"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Very good for some languages eg Spanish, but less so for others eg Russian. Fixed course means the previous flexibility to ensure the course meets your needs is no longer possible - bad downgrade for experienced linguists"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,You get what you put in. I've learned a lot more vocabulary but still struggle with conversation. Many of the sentences seem unrealist for a traveler just trying to navigate another country.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is slow moving on the free version, but it is free. I recommend trying to recall what you learned by writing it after the course. Also trying speaking what you learn after each session."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is helping me wonderfully to improve my French and to learn some modern Greek. It's easy to use but very thorough and helps you both listen to native speakers and practise speaking as well as reading.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Really good app I love the learning style, it's a great tool and lots of fun. Little bit too much extra stuff going on that's not needed, the customer service team were great."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"adds are ridiculous. I used this app back when it truly was free, with no hearts system. I'm not a fan of the leader board system either. It's hard enough trying my best. Why should I compete with others and feel terrible?"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it is the best language app I have ever found . I have very good progress in learning Swedish language. the cute owl didn't make me miss my daily streak, not even single day. I would highly recommend this app for every new language learners BEST APP EVER!!!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The way of learning is honestly fun, but not enough. They teach how to say certain sentences, usually questions, and how to answer them. Not build your own. I can't see myself starting a conversation and not sounding like an interviewer from the knowledge this app provides."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I would recommend this app because it helped me learn spanish and Japanese, they have this little feature that helps you memorize the Japanese characters (letters) and I think it's the same for every language that doesn't use the English alphabet"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,is there no where in the app that actually explains sentence structure for the languages? it's really lacking when it comes to helping understand how sentences are set up. an explanation would be far more helpful than just constantly trying to figure it out myself.. especially as you work further down the units
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Help please! I love this app and want to keep it but apparently my credit card info. wasn't up to date. I received a notification but before I could get my credit card for my security # the payment request had disappeared and I cannot seem to find it or anywhere to pay to continue! Please can you tell me how to get to where I update my info and have you try to reprocess? I don't want to lose where I am! Thank you VERY much!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Long time user of duolingo and had been pleased with the progress I was getting from this app. Then they fired most of their human translators and seem to think that ai is a good enough replacement. Extremely disappointed in this action and thinking
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,A very good app to learn a new language and has various exercises from speaking to writing and quizzes to enable you learn the language you're interested in. It has really helped me a lot for the past 5 years. I highly recommend the app.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"the switch to AI was immediately obvious. switching to a policy of ""acceptable"" translations instead of ""accurate"" ones was a huge mistake. these languages are spoken by humans, and that's what i want to learn. human languages. not AI."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it's a very good and efficient language learning app. 1 only wished all the best parts aren't under payment options. But like they say, nothing good comes for free. great app"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Starts great, but the quality of the lessons declines significantly. You receive little-to-no explanation of grammar and sometimes the kanji is wrong. Its not been the same since the update."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is fun and easy to do on my own time. It helps me keep myself accountable as well with the commitments to maintaining a streak. I also appreciate the social aspect and encouragement from friends on the app!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"one of the best aaps out there to learn any language. Easy to use and programmed in a way that the user would find interesting, with game like design and competition between others pursuing the same language.... love itüòçüòç"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love Duolingo, I have the premium so yes there are bonuses but It works well, I have been doing Japanese for about 3 months and can now understand a decent portion of what someone would need to visit the country, although I believe the Hirigana course could be spiced up a bit."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great overall, but the language courses are mostly formal, not just casual conversing, and they've gotten real pushy with the whole super Duolingo thing. I'm quite happy with it overall though. -EmberWing7506"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"it does not let you change a question or give you hints and if you make a certain amount of mistakes you have to restart the lesson unless you pay money.even if you make a mistake in the very last question,they still won't budge and make you pay.i bet they love taking other peoples money.also,don't do the Chinese one as it is wrong.they put leaderboards in the game and it makes the app not enjoyable as it is stressful.WORST.APP.EVER."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,for me it's been super easy and fast learning and much more then I was expecting if I'm being honest..the knowledge I have gained that is..in such a short amount of time..it's only day number 8 and it's truly inspired me to keep it up..to keep learning..and I truly appreciate the service you kind people are providing
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The only real issue I have is when listening to the translations in slow speed, it has a lot of echo, and you can not hear the correct words when trying to translate it. This causes the answer to be wrong even though that's what you heard because of the echo in the sound recording."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I swear American English wasn't being used until a week or so ago. I don't want to see ""pants"" for trousers. Very inconsistent with spellings, sometimes I know I've made a mistake and it's marked as correct, others it's a genuine typo and marked wrong. Maybe either have 100% correct or 100% wrong."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm learning 2 languages daily with no problem. I can do one lesson, one of each, or twenty if I want. I can compete against other learners but it's not required. It's so easy and fun. Highly recommend"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Duo has really amped up my language learning and has done so in a fun and encouraging way. The only downside to the app is the freezes and delays I experience sometimes.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,it's really awesome. it's simple to use and I'm able to have simple conversations with my family in Spanish. I've only had it for a little while too. I think if it had some games on it that still made you learn it would add some life to it. overall amazing.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Almost 2 years using Duolingo and I believe that I'm really learning French. I'm 65, so learning new things is not as easy, but all things are possible. I will need an immersion experience which I am planning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I think it is quite good and it makes it fun to practice different languages and actually learn them,Also most other language learning apps are not as fun as duolingo and they dont have widgets for your phone to remember to practice and it is all around quite fun"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app sometimes adds things to what you type, and they can't be removed so you lose hearts through no fault of your own. Also the voice recognition on speaking exercises is unreliable."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Enjoying this app after several years and several updates. I do wish they'd go in for more explanations of grammar and idioms; I understand not everyone is as much of a grammar nerd as I am, but it would be nice to have that information available. I do like the silly sentences, which get one's attention and improve morale."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a wonderful learning app, but I feel that the price for Super is pretty expensive.. It's almost the same price to play WOW monthly! Education should be more affordable, even if it is considered a game."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,by far the best language learning app! welcome to the poor as you can earn new hearts to continue your lesson by practising your mistakes which is great for your learning anyway! ads are minimal in free version! cant recommend it enough!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Using every day. I wish there was an option for Britsh English as I'm double translating sometimes. Also I would like to choose to slow my progress sometimes but it doesn't seem designed for that.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is a very good application to learn any language, I learn Turkish and Korean on it, but I did not like the many ads on it, and I will not like it either that it made me subscribe to Super Duolingo without my desire and I will not be able to cancel it"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo has recently laid off a majority of their translator employees, including some who have worked for 5+ years, in an effort to push strictly AI phrases for languages. This is incredibly gross, and I strongly advise anyone who reads this to cancel your subscription if you have one. Vote with your wallet to show that this is unacceptable and a needlessly cruel thing to do to their passionate and talented staff who just want to spread the joy and culture of languages."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Tysm duo my russian has improved now I can talk to my mom and her friends and family!! <333 I 100% recommend this game if you want to learn a language as it's fun as there are different things to do like record your voice to guess the correct word. It is also like a mini game as you can make a profile and there is a leaderboard and you can move up stages like bronze to silver. There is also a widget to put on your phone and it tells your day you did it and when to do it!! BYE<33 have a good day!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is obviously American English, in UK we do not say ma'am. Also Mademoiselle is no longer used in French. A third thing is some of the voices are very strange. But I am happy to learn a new language, and feel I have made progress. üòÄ"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"the first couple of lessons are not useful but once you get further into the lessons the more useful they get and I'm doing Spanish, Greek, Portuguese but mainly Spanish and I feel like once I got to the getting around the city that's when it got useful I've had a couple of full conversations in Spanish"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"With the latest update, daily quests are not counting for the monthly badge. There is a glitch in counting daily quests. This makes it impossible to complete the badge challenge in a timely manner."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's madenning how money driven this app has become. The advertisement is just unacceptable, it's not ""free"" if you push so hard on paying. Ads for premium run far louder than the lessons + other abusive manipulations I'll never fall for. Despite Duolingo being about real people, you're now silently forcing silly avatars just so you wouldn't have to moderate them. It's about profit optimisation, just like any other soulless company. I'm never paying for this and I always have an adblocker on."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It makes learning fun but I do not think sexual orientation needs to be added to the content for learning. I feel then it is an agenda rather than just a lesson in language learning, therefore there should be an option to choose to opt out of that type of content."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have learned a lot in 23 days so far. Would be nice if words were explained better. like in Spanish esta,este,estas, etc. Super Duolingo Should be offered for free to 3rd world countries that don't have a credit cards or other means to pay. like Cuba, Haiti etc"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Is worth it but half the time any answer you put will either not be selected or the app will not mark it as correct. The more language corces you do the slower the app runs and it won't always start on the language you changed it to.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I am so sad. I loved this app until they charged me a full year without notifying me 2 days prior like it said when I opted for the trial. I would not be so upset but I expected them to hold to their word. I never got any notifications. I will use my years worth of language learning but I've already canceled so I won't do another year, and I refuse to recommend you to anyone else for bad business ethic practices. If you say you will notify your potential client then you should hold to your word."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it's very easy to learn a language in Duolingo, much more so than other apps I have tried. I am enjoying the process. It reminds me of when I have to take a lesson to keep my streak, I am very forgetful so that is very appreciated. All in all a great app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"always had trouble learning a language, my new years resolution was to finally learn spanish.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terribly useless for actual learning & constant ads! Only teaches you random words, useless for human speaking a language. Stressful like a game, shows random words not telling what they mean. FULL OF CONSTANT ADS.

All I can say is ""generous chicken"" & ""cold husband"" üôÑ Only good are the big letters for learning Arabic calligraphy. Memrise is 1000% better"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,might just be that im 60 but I've been doing this for 400+ days and I really thought I'd be more fluent in Spanish than I am . That being said. . Duo does make learning Spanish fun and encourages you to keep at it.. I think my complaints are more related to old dogs learning new tricks.. But I refuse to give up .
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,very good just finished my Italian course was disappointed to find no mention on my achievements page one criticism would be that the dictionary section often gives the wrong vocabulary annoying especially when you lose a life also the constant Americanisms are tedious we don't have Downtown or movies or pants someone should research English usage as spoken in England.... especially when the Italian is cinema and you expect us to translate it as movie theatre..sorry theater!!!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It is free and it is fun and in the app it looks like a game and it gets to be fun like a game but you don't even realize it and you're learning a language. you can follow friends on it and track their progress. It's fun like a game. you can create an avatar and you can upgrade it to super Duolingo but you have to pay for that and and you can practice unlimited on that and however many errors you get you don't lose hearts.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"App is buggy for 85.00 a year all up front. App usage consumes a lot of phones battery, it seems to be oddly processor heavy like a live action game Competition is a nice motivator Encouraging It's just memorization, there is no education about the rules that govern the language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Fun, amazing and enjoyable way to learn . Teaches you kn a amazingaay with not many adds it also gives you a random 3 day trial for super duolingo without having to fill anything out. I just got one."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It really sucks that you guys have laid off a majority of your Human staff and replaced them with A.I. Artificial Intelligence should not be used for learning languages. I've found out some of what I am learning is incorrect and Duolingo doesn't offer explanations for certain phrases, rules, and new words. I prefer to use Busuu."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I think it's a great tool for learning languages, but can we have something like day off system that you can apply for or something? Like, I am going on a trip and I just don't have the time or the mood to rly have a good practice session. I don't mind losing my streak, but can you please stop being mad at me or threatening me and let me enjoy my freaking vacation?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They're a thief and unprofessional! I'm having a problem with them since September. Whenever I approach a higher department, they send me back to customer service, whom they aren't escalating the issue internally, nor can't they solve my problem since its out of their responsibilities. Pay more for a reputable test provider."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The lesson starts with words directly without telling meaning. The dictionary, phrases are in different corner. The most difficult is pronounciation. The words can't be spoken confidently. Everytime I've to go to same practice words & phrases to get stars. Yet I'm not convinced that I can learn any language comfortably."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I am very disappointed in Duolingo on Samsung. There is no access to the vocabulary and the Unit views are very limited. No opportunity to see why the answers are wrong either. Has this been removed? Not happy with Duolingo at all.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great app. Intuitive lessons and interface. Runs smoothly and the notification sounds are nice. Reasonable amount of advertisement and many different languages to learn.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Super Duolingo? Really? Otherwise I will be catched in some stupid mistakes like: Judy is a good and fast translator - is wrong Judy is a fast and good translator - is right. Not the same thing at all üòÄ And all of my hearts will burning out so I can't complete my schedule.. I understand it's your application and it's your policy of work. You need to sell it.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Some choices are obvious based on hints. Rapid reviews do not give ample time to complete even when my native-speaking friend tries it. Fun that friends can join. I paid for a premium membership, but feel the rapid review is trying to push me to spend more."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Excellent app to try and learn a new language. Been doing it for 3 months and so far my progress is excellent. One suggestion is to give a doubt clearing tab where we can keep asking our doubts with experts.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Really good app but the continuous course changes make it impossible to actually learn anything. Mine was just recently change significantly and I missed out on so much language that I cannot move forward
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They laid off REAL people to just focus on AI, keeping enough people employed to make sure the AI was ""acceptable."" Not even accurate. Just acceptable. AI is simply not good enough yet. Grow up, Duo, and pay real human beings. Don't bother giving money to executives who have enough already. They obviously aren't using the money to pay translators, so $85 per year just isn't worth it. Try MangoLanguages- it's a FREE app through your local library."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"When learning Japanese, there are some fill in the blank exercises which are completely written in Japanese. It would be great if there is an option to view the same in English as well, since many people may not want to learn how to read and write but just want to learn to speak a new language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I personally love this app. I like how the lessons are straightforward and do a good job of teaching how to translate English to the language you desire or how to say a word in said language. Now, I will admit this feels like a game, and sometimes that makes me not want to get on and learn. Overall, this is amazing, but I do think there is room for improvement."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I enjoyed learning German, Hindi is atrocious. There's no way to distinguish the sound of letters like dha and Dha, ta and Ta etc. As a person who strives to always go for 100% accuracy, it's EXTREMELY infuriating to be punished for ""mistakes"" in excersises where they throw both small and big letter characters. Not to mention that pronunciation excersises don't work, as in when I hold the button to speak, it immediately stops itself saying it couldn't hear me. YEAH, BECAUSE YOU DONT LET ME SPEAK"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Some good, but I wish rules of grammar were taught in lessons rather than just straight translation. Also, the app randomly stops working in the middle of lessons, which is frustrating"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Was getting frustrated with how the lessons are planned and don't explain things very well like sentence structure and word break downs that would give context. Then they canned over half their employees to replace them with AI which is a bad sign. AI implementation in language based programs has only deteriorated in quality: see spellcheck oddities of late. It‚Äôs not like AI can understand these problems, and the employees left will be swamped. Dump this program. It's too late to salvage it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is absolutely splendid.It teaches you languages in such an understandable and easy way that you can master a language in a few months.I highly recommend it. (please help me Duolingo is keeping my family captive in his basement)
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"best language app ive ever used. really helped me learn diffrent languages but it could use more detail in them like numbers and months. also maybe add more languages like albanian or afrikaans, but over all really good. strongly recommend super duolingo. you can start as a free 2 week trial and yeah, rly good ü§ó"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was concerned about trying to learn another language in my late thirties, but Duolingo makes it easy and fun. My family and I are visiting Japan for the first time this summer and I wanted to be able to have a baseline knowledge of common words and phrases. I'm 25 days in and my family have seen my progress and want to learn as well. we just got the family plans and now we have a friendly competition going amongst us."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I personally think this is the best app you can get to learn any basic language. The rewards you get also motivates you to do more practice and they also give you free super duolingo for 3 days every month(approx.) Gracias Duo por enamorarme del espa√±ol.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"2 days in and I'm learning some useful phrases. You can click on the speaker icon to hear the phrase, you can also click on the underlined words to see the translations and hear them in isolation from the rest of the sentence. So far so good!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The Korean speaking exercises doesn't work. I tried Chinese and I can speak through it fine. I have speaking exercises on, my microphone is on. Everything works with a different language just not korean. Can you please fix this???"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Opted for Chinese Language. Learning wise it is good. This App makes you addicted to it. Points or scores are deliberately not updated and makes you feel more anxious. More Ads is also a negative part. This is mere gaming app.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,this game is really good if you're going to travel or you just want to do it for fun education whatever you want to do be able to talk to your friends if they speak another language or someone from another country so you can get directions or ask about stuff it's really good I'm 13 and just want to learn Spanish for fun but they're just like a lot of languages that you could learn and you can expand your vocabulary and you can do it for 3 minutes 15 minutes or 20 minutes I think I like the appü©∑
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love this app. The competition factor is a great motivator and after 27 days of learning I'm still highly motivated. Only downside is that the app usually crashes quite a lot.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"app/experience is different on android compared to iOS some.features on iOS do not exist on Android and vice versa. great otherwise. though for gamification features need some work. rankings and ""opponents"" should be made by matching past performances. e.g. don't match up someone that regularly get 40k xp with someone that only maxes at 10k XP it creates unfair competition."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo excels in language learning but lacks Urdu, a major language. Its absence alienates millions of potential learners. Incorporating Urdu aligns with Duolingo's goal of inclusivity, opening doors for Urdu speakers worldwide. By adding Urdu, Duolingo expands its user base and enriches the platform's linguistic diversity. This move isn't just about a language; it's about embracing inclusivity and offering access to language education for all."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been learning Welsh with Duo Lingo. In all that time I've not spent a penny on it, even though there's a premium option which you pay to use, it's perfectly possible to learn at your own speed without it. I've learnt so much, it's fun and addictive."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I just started learning Italian yesterday and today I can speak Italian with my Grandmother in Italy. It teaches very fast and you can know the language you want in 1 hour so playful and when you play it it enters your head fast and after you will realise yourself speaking it's if it was your native language. It such a comfortable way of learning and every where you are.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is a wonderful app. Even the free version is great. The only interruption is very short ads after each lesson. It is definitely a great tool to learn a new language!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Uses AI, poor lesson structure and is less effective over time than similar apps. Doesn't cover basic language principles. For example soft mutations in Welsh. More interested in being a meme over a useful product. Regret my subscription."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love how they incourage you throughout your lesson, and it's very rare for adds to come up. lots of languages you can learn, they have a separate app for just numbers and letters also, over all love this app very nice!!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I am enjoying learning with Duolingo. It is as easy or difficult as you want it to be and there is no limit on how much you can practice for free without a subscription. I have been using the app for about six weeks. no complaints so far. üëçüèΩ
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The app is very good to use and convenient too as well. It's simple and easy-peasy to learn. I recommend this to each and everyone who would want to be an expert in French. Thank you 'Duolingo'.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Update to my review. I've been using Duo daily since Summer 2022, in order to learn Spanish from scratch having never learned any other languages. It seems to be going well and the regular updates keep the app fresh and engaging. I have a paid subscription and it's worth every penny."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's a good learning app. Yet , If I go to practice for a long time, if I make more than 5 mistakes, I can't practice anymore. Buying unlimited hearts is also costly. Sometimes I get asked the meaning of words that I don't know about. I don't know, that's why I have come to learn . If you ask me a new word there, I lose my heart because I don't know the answer. I hope you will pay attention to this aspect"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love this app so helpful to learn! I just have one complaint when I downloaded this on my new phone all my progress was lost. but it kept all my language courses it just started me back at unit 1 even though I was at unit 7...
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The UK/English grammar is shockingly bad. so bad, I'd call it American grammar and simplified English. why does this warrant a bad review? Well, if I use English grammar, I loose a heart and its counted as an error. You'd think a language specialist would get that right?.... Update a year later. nope. I will not be americanised. shocking English. loosing hearts still happens for Duo's poor interpretation of the English language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a very nice practical app, which helps you to learn any language you like in the time supplied by you. The best thing is that there are no ads interrupting your learning. So, what are you waiting for?"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I think the lessons need to be reviewed so that I am not required to give an answer that is clearly incorrect to keep my hearts..e.g. when I am required to answer, zoranj, as the correct answer was not provided. There were also English translations that required more words to complete the sentence."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I learned a substantial amount of portuguese on duolingo. Their content was occasionally odd or robotic, but the service was good. It's a shame that they are presently putting humans second."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"this is a very good application but the one and only problem is always the same, which are ads. Everything is otherwise very nice. I have learned so much from this app. It is just like a game. I have even declared this application as a game by putting it in my games folder üòÜ. I am learning French from this application and I am now almost at the end of the course."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app keeps on getting worse withe every update - it also just tells you what's the correct way to form a sentence, for example, but doesn't explain why the sentence is like that. It also used to have a community tab where you could at least ask other about daid sentence, but it was removed. Duolingo is decent if you're not trying to bevome fluent. If you are, I'd recommend getting another app or two in addition to Duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This program uses a smart blend of exercises, reviews, gradual introduction of new material, and constant encouragement. It has made me a better teacher, in addition to helping me be a successful learner."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"since the increased use of AI there are more translation errors than ever. also, XP is not adding up correctly. I have submitted multiple bug reports and this is still an issue"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,App freezes during timed challenges and you have to restart the app.sometimes the sound doesn't play right so you hear something other than the word that should be played and you get it wrong.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,it's good but the constant push to get you to buy the app and pay monthly is painful I understand the business model but not a big fan. Also there are quite a lot of mistakes. but overall I am enjoying it.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to be great, but the greedy monetization has ruined it. I also hear now they're laying off folks to use AI translations. If that has already started then it makes sense. AI is terrible for the languages I am trying to become more proficient in."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I love how convenient and fun duolingo is. However, AI is not an acceptable replacement for human curated and created lessons. AI is not able to understand nuanced human speech and as a company that is teaching people how to speak other languages it is YOUR responsibility to make sure that you're providing accurate and competent lessons to the people taking your courses."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The best part about this app is that it is free. the notifications can be a little bit annoying, but they do help you stay on track with your learning. Also the ads you get are dumb."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I think it's a very good idea to combine learning and fun in the same category. In school, they would just use mostly worksheets to teach language this is fun and it teaches better"

I only learned a few new words, and then I didn't want to continue. It made me confused, too. I get something wrong. And then I do what they want me to do, and I'm still wrong"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hate the ads, but great app. I understand that you need revenue but the ads can be really distracting and kind of ruin some lessons. Still 5 stars though because of the fact that I do actually learn something for free"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Eveey update rhe hints are more and more incorrect. I had a friend whose first language is Mexican Spanish go through the questions with me and they laughed at the hints and acceptable answers The Spanish is way off on acceptable answers and the hints are incorrect in many instances. Not a great way to learn fluent and easily spoken Spanish.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Reducing your actual human workforce to focus on AI generated sentences and translations is a huge misplay and will only lead to increasingly poor quality. I feel I can no longer trust Duolingo to give me sentences that make sense or translations that are accurate. I have enjoyed Duolingo but think it is time for me to move on now that their human translators are not being treated with respect and instead seen as expendable and replaced with AI to cut costs.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I seem to be progressing but it feels a little slow at times. A little too much review and repetitive lessons. Try to add more vocabulary a little more quickly.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is a fun app to use and the lessons are short and easy to understand. I love it. But I have a little complain. I can't open lessons even with my data on cos it keep saying I'm offline even when I have data. I have to wait until someone shares his/her hotspot and it's making it difficult for me to do my lessons. I've fallen from the diamond League to the emerald League cos of this. what's the issue?
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,excellent learning app but the idea of only having consecutive days or streaks as learning commitment options is slightly impractical. one gap day between streaks isn't really an under-achievement. I love this app and Duo the Green Owl.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It can help teach you more words and phrases, but mostly it's useful for daily practice for a language. it really helps to remember things if you see it every day."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Louis Rechnagel Skovgaard: Great game! It's perfect for learning all sorts of languages, and it being more of a game than a teacher sitting you down and telling you how it works is a lot better! While the lives mechanic could be better, I like it a lot. (P.S. please release my family Duo.)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was a bit dubious about the short lessons. But the structure is repetitive, building vocabulary and grammar by context. It is a very good tool."

I've always gone to Duolingo when I want to learn a new language, but never again unless they turn that around and fix things. We don't need AI."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is very entertainment and help to study different languages. I will share my experience got from this app to my friends and I will recommend to them for downloading this app. I am thank to my friend for said about this app to me. I like this app's logo, character, animation etc. This app will teach us in simple way. This helps me in my studies very well. I am very weak in hindi subject. But, after using this app, Hindi is my favorite subject. Now I finished my hindi course. Thank you."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a goood app to learn new and explore new languages and very engaging app to learn language like you're playing a game and one more thing I can tell you that your app looks little empty without the oldest language on the earth and that is Sanskrit so I want one more language to add in Duolingo app and that is the Sanskrit so please add a course of it if you want more people to explore your app cause millions of people want to learn Sanskrit but they can't find the perfect platform.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have been using this app since 2016. It helps you develop a learning routine quickly and provides continual feedback on your progress. Highly recommended for anyone interested in learning the basics of another language.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,ads are annoying. the progress is good but you have to figure things out when it comes to different languages like you don't any alphabets you gotta learn them separately. but it's good
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"s√∫per funcional para practicar constantemente, lo cual es lo m√°s dif√≠cil de hacer. Ahora siento de verdad estoy practicando japon√©s. hella functional to practice constantly which is the hardest part of learning a language. For the first time I feel I'm really practicing Japanese."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it's a good app. only complaint is the limited amount of languages. I originally downloaded Duolingo to learn Portuguese (from Portugal) but all they had was Portuguese (from Brazil). otherwise, it's good."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The only way to use the practice hub is to purchase super duolingo. No thanks. It just repeats the same stuff over and over. You're not really learning much if you are just trying to brush up.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If you want to get taunted and mocked daily. You can have this app. Learning should have a positive and encouraging environment, which is totally opposite in this app. People want to learn for fun at their own pace. They already have enough stress in their daily lives. Adding stress and mocking customers is never a way to grow. .I."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great tool. I stuck with the free version for 55 days. The paid one is a much smoother way to learn though. It would be good if there was a pay monthly option though.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's super basic and can help create a foundation. Abusive and intrusive advertising if you don't want to pay a subscription. Also, the AI translations are awful."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is superb. Anyone can start learning at any time, it also has many features which will motivate you to keep learning. We can add family and friends to learn together."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"not as hard as some people say just do it every day it takes like 3 minutes, it helps practice your commitment and it's fun the characters are all unique and duo is genuinely scary, all in all a great place to learn a language"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Fun and addictive way to learn a new language. Would be better with some short explanations every now and then rather than just having to figure it out through trial and error.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My experience is not good at all on duolingo because after completing 100 days they gave me 3 days super duolingo preview and yesterday is the last day but I want to cancel it but the option to cancel it is not shown in the phone app. Ho Rahaliye I have also mailed him but instead of giving any response he is resending my mail I dont know what to do.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,full of dark patterns. daily quests are chores and become more work the more you do. the monthly badges require more points the longer you do them. my course is google translate only. horrible voice and typos. forum is disabled for the language and they took the whole money for the year at once ‚Äì no warning. constantly trying to get me to buy more stuff! even the first level of the sidequest isnt doable
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo has been valuable for Bengali learners, but there's room for improvement. Adding more English topics specific to Bengali users, introducing Urdu and Bengali languages, and creating a dedicated grammatical section would enrich the learning content. The pronunciation section could also benefit from enhancements to provide a more realistic and effective language learning experience. These improvements would make Duolingo an even more powerful tool for language enthusiasts."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app, would give 5 stars if it had even more languages such as Amharic or Afrikaans. Also, an explanation for which you is singular and which is plural in the various languages would be helpful. Apart from that amazing user experience. Keep it up Duolingo"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Good app to learn. It would be nice to have a place with a list of the different verbs and how they relate to the nouns. Example Nous always ends with - ons. When to use Mes vs Ma or Mon
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"it is a great app, it makes me learn a lot but it has quite a problem. It corrects me, making losing ""hearts"" because of wrong using of English (e.g. wrong topic English phrase) though I did not start using Duolingo to learn English."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,i am very thankful to the owner of the Duolingo app . this app helps me a lot to learn the different languages and to communicate with people . this app is just amazing . I will say this app play many roles in my life like a best teacher a best friend & entertainment & educational. this app is much better than many schools institute I learned & enjoyed a lot . thanks a lot for making my like ease ‚ù§Ô∏è
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It is a nice app for beginners, unfortunately it does not support portugese, so it makes learning quite hard. It lack some explanation for the grammar. Also the app just ignores every correction input."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The lessons are too easy, while skipping to progress is very difficult. I am unable to skip ahead, but feel like I am not learning much. I already new some very basics of the language I'm trying to learn"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app helps a lot. Not only will you learn but you will also understand in a fast moment. It looks like a teacher teaching and a student listening and learning.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It's not fair that those who pay for extras in Duolingo compete with those who use the basic version with ads. Otherwise it's a great tool for learning..
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Do yourself a favor and only use this as a supplement and not as a primary way of learning a language. If I didn't have a Chinese wife to explain things to me, I would have quit the lessons. There are also several times my wife calls out certain things are flat-out wrong. As far as the speaking portions, they are dogsh*t. I've had the program say I'm wrong without even having been given a second to respond."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,A fun and easy way to learn a new language with short lessons and many different topics. Keep a notebook and pen closeby to write down what you've learned! Really helpful if you put in the effort.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I don't like that Duolingo doesn't explain the grammer rules it's trying to teach you. Even worse is how the company is moving to AI instead of using actual translators. I won't be renewing my subscription and am looking for another language app.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm absolutely loving how engaging this app is. I have ADHD which makes it difficult to focus, but DuoLingo's game show style really holds my focus. I feel like I'm actually learning. I've even begun conversing with my friends, family, and especially my children in my learned languages."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I rate this 5 stars, all the way, because I like Duolingo a lot, and I am impressed on how Duolingo can intrigue you to keep getting on the app and learn. I am learning German right now for fun, and I am doing a good job at staying with the app. Thank you for Having me download this, Antony!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Do not pay for it..... I would like if the max time for ads was 15 second. The only problem is the glitches, sometimes your answer will be right but it'll say it's wrong the first time around. And the matching game can be sluggish and not always provide the matching word right away, which slows you down. Sometimes theres bad grammer. Ex... quien es la chef de este restaurante, supposed to translate to who is the chief of this restaurant?....but there wasn't anything close to match it too."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"duolingo is a fun way to learn any language, from Japanese to Korean to any. with ADHD and a hard time focusing on things i learn this has been a fun and motivating way to learn. the characters are amazing and their voices fit their characters. in conclusion this is a good way to learn."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Recently fired their translators in favor of AI, disappointing. I will only be using this to learn kana, and then I'm switching to another app or textbooks. If the Duolingo team can rethink this decision, I might keep the app beyond kana. Do better Duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,the app is good to use and easy to learn but the lessons they are giving us are easy not challenging ....means they are teaching simple words for a long time ...it's boring for me . you should teach useful words in our day to day life then we will use those words in society.teach us basics for one month after that teach us use full words because we are elders we can learn quickly.depending on age you should change your lessons.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is AMAZING. It's so fun and educational, the characters are cute and funny, and the amount of languages that you can learn is once again AMAZING. I would 100% recommend this to anyone who wants to learn a language. Have fun :]"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Skip Learning Korean on Duolingo. However, DO learn spanish here. I have the no ads sub on a family plan. Do not go in between pc and mobile. Information doesn't transfer properly. Choose a device and stick to it. Lately the app on mobile has been freezing quite a bit. That's how I found out about the transfer issue. Transparency note: review went from 1 star to 3. Korean lessons were horrid and unhelpful. Spanish lessons are constructed infinitely better."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,App is getting buggier with leaderboards failing to show and all networked games failing. Especially annoying after one spends 100 credits on getting a points boost (but the games go offline so it's wasted).

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It offers effective language learning with interactive exercises and personalized feedback. Its gamified approach keeps learners engaged, making it a popular choice for beginners and advanced learners alike."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Nice way to learn a language when you don't have time/energy/money for classes, but it goes way slower than speaking and using the language. Would be nice if you could choose which courses to follow"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great App for learning foreign languages, you have to be patient with the free versions adds but the 3 day FREE trial that appears after you learn for a few days is a really fun way to engange the learner!! Great stuff Duolingo"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Sentence variation within a single topic/level is very lacking, makes it easy to feel bored. Also, they removed the comment sections, which plays a big part to the language learning experience in Duolingo."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My wife and I both started this and liked it enough to upgrade to Super, but for some unexplained reason you cannot use a family plan for this because you cannot invite an existing user to join a family plan. This is beyond stupid and was a huge dissatisfier. This also is NOT disclosed before you sign up for a family plan which is dishonest given the significance of the limitation."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Uses way way too much data. Lessons seem to be designed to create more opportunity to sell product than to teach language. Otherwise, you can learn a language well, in time, if you apply yourself."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,loving how easy it makes it to learn a new language. Regardless of wether or not you pay for the perks of super Duolingo this app is well rounded and perfect for learning. Already at my 21 day streak
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Deleted app since not only have they laid off a bunch of their workers and are no longer updating ""less popular"" languages like Welsh, but they are now using ai to do their translations. I want to learn from am actual human being, not a computer that has been proven time and time again to be faulty. Duolingo can no longer be trusted to teach languages, they've chosen money over knowledge."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"After the last update it keeps getting stuck on the same level (example: I finish level 4/5, instead of advancing to 5/5 it makes me repeat level 4/5 multiple times...)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Wonderful learning experience with easy to memorize and retain lessons in daily chucks to keep the new words fresh in your mind long enough to be retained. I just love learning languages through Duolingo's slow and steady method!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Your stupid, purple, reward potion boost ran out mid duration of my rapid review & FROZE, then forced closed the app. When I came back, I lost 100 gems. Why is YOUR forced in-game reward causing me to lose in-game currency for using a feature YOU implemented? Side note: would be wonderful to have a system that touched on gender rules & grammatical rules.Questions don't make it clear that the format of certain words change due to m/f terms Godforbid we want to know why beyond a vague 'ur wrong'."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It is a very good app. With all the notification it keeps sending me it very motivating since it won't stop until you unless you do at least a single lesson. But in all it is a good guide
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It was good at first and everything was going well until they brought the ""You're Offline"" post that limits you from practicing any lessons. I mean what's with that anyways? Why you're offline all the time when I know that I am online, it has made the app uninteresting"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,it's been fun learning with Duolingo. the reminders help me to be consistent and the rewards are often a good motivation to keep going. it's indeed a fun method of learning. can't wait to try out the paid service
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Horrible app. 10 months in and I can't ask and answer how someone is doing, or order a coffee the way I like it. Do I REALLY need to know that the elephant is on the table, or what the word is for elephant at all, when I'm beginning? When I decided to take a break I got a series of emails attempting to gaslight me, and that convinced me to never go back."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Would give it 5 stars if they increased the streak freezes from 2 to 3 at least for super payers. It is frustrating when you work a long day but you don't have enough time to practice your languages.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have tried to contain and manage the subpar service since last year but I am too annoyed to continue! I paid for subscription service and since then it no longer serves me properly. They do not give me my points. I can answer correctly and it'd be tagged wrong. I am disappointed and angry that I paid for this!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"After having used this app for more than a year, I have determined that I cannot recommend it, at least if your purpose is to actually learn a language. The design of this is to finish first and have fun, not to become fluent. There can be a benefit of getting practice, but it is not an alternative to programs that are designed to help you get beyond translating a language in your mind. Using a leader board encourages competition & this is where DuoLingo fails, aa this serves the app, not you."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Legacy Mode would really make a lot of people happy. This Yellow Brick Road business treats us like kids. Wonderland is lost (for now)!

I wonder what piece of research told then to go against a decade of reliable research? It WAS fun, now it just looks pretty. I would start over if I had to if I could go back!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is the best app to learn new languages. You can always trust Duolingo but it don't have afrikaans which I need to learn for school.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love Duolingo. However some of the sentences are being repeated many many times so I know them off by heart. Also I find some sentences are a little negative..like an annoying paternal uncle. this sentence has been repeated many many times as well. what about sentences like: - I forgot my umbrella. - It is raining so I need my umbrella. - I have an appointment with the doctor. - I am late for the appointment. - I want to get to the appointment early. - I am really pleased with you.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The purpose of this platform is to keep you on the app with minimal/slowest possible learning and the game concept to make you feel as if you are progressing but in actual you are not. If you want to learn a language take a course and forget this time wasting platform
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"an absolute amazing learning up. i can do it at my own convenient time.. the strategy is also great, by the end of the week am able to remember what i learnt on Monday. highly recommend üëç"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"5-years of use... Still unhappy with the loss of explanations, etc and with the new lesson path structure. But the bigger issue is when the app doesn't register your lessons... I just ""read the next story in my path"" like the daily quests listed and it didn't count it! Pretty demotivating if I can't easily review skills that I need to work on like it used to be or have my efforts acknowledged."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love this app Because It helps us to learn new languages which are there in the world. If you go to any coaching classes of any language This is an app which can help you to improve that language. But the only thing I don't like of this app is there are no indian languages which Indians can also learn. So who made this app? They can make one more app for indian languages if you Can. I'm so Happy of this app

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"fun, but the lessons aren't well organised. the Japanese course pushes you to learn and do the main course first without going through the alphabet. the gamification of the studying though is compelling enough to keep me going and do the hiragana and katakana first on my own"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,A great app for slow and steady learning day by day. It is enough to understand daily/simple conversation. The notifications are personally cute and helpful. It is a fun app. Hitting my 90 day streak as I give this review!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have been using duolingo for over 2 years now, but I was extremely distressed upon learning that Duolingo are firing employees and replacing them with machines. I hope that duolingo may return to being a not-for profit app which gives teachers their proper price and avoids using machines for such humanly intrinsic practices as language learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app, but the recent update has disallowed me to use the app. I mean, when I tried to open the app every time, it returned to my homescreen. Hope Duolingo will fix the problem soon."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo's sassy comments on tik tok brought me here. This app is fun and interactive. The user interface is not complicated and is visually attractive. Recommended for learning a new language while enjoying your time.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"With the recent addition of ""AI"" tools as a replacement for real humans doing actual translation work, the quality of the app has drastically gone down. Who would've guessed firing half of your staff would that? I immediately cancelled my Super Duolingo subscription, and emailed support. I hope Duolingo will realize their mistake in adding dysfunctional ""AI"" translation. I don't know how anyone is supposed to learn from a broken, over-glorified Google translate app. I used to like Duo. Oh well."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I was really enjoying it now while I'm very motivated to learn a specific language, keeping a long streak and climbing the leaderboards is fun, but the app's performance issues getting stuck at the end of lessons (during double exp periods) combined with the extremely repetitive & long ads for premium are very demotivating. Only reason I don't drop it more often is probably the long streak going."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I loved this app and learned. I now pay a subscription but find that the app sometimes won't allow me access especially at certain times. I pointed this out on a previous review and was advised to switch to beta but as it says here beta is now full. I don't expect this on an app I pay quite a lot of money for.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"(learning japanese)Good for a casual approach. progression is decent. Option to turn off romaji is nice(which id recommend). later they go over a decent amount of kanji. App is entirely free unless you want to be top of leaderboards. Cons: it might be too formal. there would be things japanese wouldn't say, or would rarely say in certain situations. also some of the speakers(avatars) can be incorrect or unintelligible, possibly cause it might be ai trying to mash words together."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Replacing all the real translators with AI is SHAMEFUL. The audios is the Portuguese course sound all garbled and wrong, too. Less like a person talking and more like a badly recorded automated phone system."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Honestly it's a great app to learn from, but the notifications have become downright emotional manipulation. It leaves a sour taste in my mouth anytime I see one, I don't like feeling guilt tripped by an app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The experience of this app is compromised. The ability to do lessons which progress your learning is greatly devalued by leagues which you can't turn off and low XP rewards for furthering your learning. I've also been unable to collect free gems using the free version for over a month as they ruthlessly push premium onto me. No ads is fine but without gems you can't complete challenges or fully complete the levels of lessons you've previously done to 'legendary' level.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is very good to learn a language, but I think that it would be better if there would be some more grammar in the Japanase course. It would also be good if you could chose which character you want to learn particularly and not just that you need to listen and show which character it is after that you have write it some times. It should have been also fun if there have been a Islandic course. But over all, it is a very good app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is useful for learning languages, but the Heart System is ridiculous! How can you be expected to learn with the stress of running out of hearts? And practicing to get more hearts takes too long and is annoying. And the constant ads advertising Duolingo Pro, something which is paid and doesn't even tell you how much it is per-month... These are complaints you've heard many times, but refuse to do anything about. These problems negatively affect User experience. Please fix them!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,In a recent patch HUNDREDs of video ads are added and the 40xp challenges (which is a major way to review) can no longer be done freely... The free-to-play experience is nasty.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Incredible application helps but the constant ""hurry up, you lose your place"" ""they move you"" etc. etc. you go in to practice and not to compete, that is tiring, please control that flow of notices to your subscribers!!!!!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Geat app to learn. Although when you make a mistake and lose your heart you can't get back to keep trying (unless you have the gems) There is no option to go back to review when hearts/lives are lost. (I can't afford the monthly fee)
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This is a very great app. At first I didn't know from where I can learn French but when I started learning it from Duolingo it made French easy to understand. I recommend you to install this app and learn a new language. Gain some knowledge about other languages also. That was all. Merci beaucoup. (Thank you very much)
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is a great app for learning other languages! I really recommend it! At first I didn't know any Japanese and now look at me! I can introduce myself in Japanese in just 3-4 months even my mom uses it now so download Duolingo before it's too late!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is great! I can learn multiple answers and there is hardly any ads! I love getting new streaks daily. I rated four stars because sometimes it tells you the answers. That is all that is bad really. I also love making my avatar üòç. üåü üåü üåü üåü
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,5 hearts equals 2 stars. I get it. They want you to go to super but in learning new language you are going to make mistakes and pushing your price one on us after some mistakes just makes me not want to learn.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I'll give you the five star but the problem is that when you run out of hearts what's the point of even having hearts because when you make a mistake it correct you that's why I would not give it a five star but it's still really really amazing it helps us with really good languages especially French
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"As a longtime lover of language learning, I feel comfortable in saying that Duolingo is an extremely valuable tool. I use it every day. Bear in mind that it is a tool, and not a magic wand. You still need to combine it with book study and classes if you can afford it. And talking."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Fantastic way of learning languages and its taught me so very much. I just wish the app wasn't so terrible. It regularly takes a LONG time loading lessons, switching between languages, most of the time it takes two or three aborted attempts for the app to even open and now, for no reason at all, it's refusing to recognise my log in details no matter how many times I reset my password. Used to be pioneering, now it's just pathetic."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It makes learning a new language so accessible and fun. However, as a Swahili speaker, I'd advise to check on a few words and spelling e.g makasi - scissors, otherwise a very good app for beginners."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Excellent learning experience with the Duolingo app. I'm enjoying learning French and so much more! I've been on it for over 2 years now. I highly recommend this app for learning new languages.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,it's a really good app for learning any language in a fun and easy manner I learned english from this app it helped alot to in my journey of learning English I would like suggest you all to learn any language you want because it is great platform to learn any language without any cost so hurry up and download this and give a boost In your learning journey
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is top notch in language learning so far the language is one covered by them, the paid version is way better as you will be taken through different steps till you have gained perfection in the language of choice."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is the perfect app for whomever wants to learn any international language. It makes learning a language fin through the use of game like setting, levels, prices in form of xp and gems. And competitive spirit from the score on the leader board thus giving the motivation to finish the course. I love Duolingo. It is one app you will never regret having."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Gave it a final shot, but they have finally managed to destroy the language learning experience in favour of making more money. Constant interruptions by ads or ads to remove ads. Final straw was the failure of the app to register practice, and them shame you for not practising."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I did 400 experience but it was not reflected. Then I made 60 experience and now I see and I only have 15 exp. I believe if you do not purchase the super plan then they will steal your experience. It is a pity I really like this app. I will have to stop using it sadly.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really like Duolingo, but sometimes the sentences you learn are pretty unrealistic and overly repetitive. Whilst learning German and Dutch I've spent multiple levels repeating the same basic words, when some of that time could have been spent learning other basic words. I don't need to learn what the word for bread is 40 times, whilst not knowing the words for different fruit or vegetables at all."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Latest version of app hides the autocomplete bar on Google keyboard. This removes access to the voice-to-text button and makes the Duolingo app harder to use for people with accessibility issues.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to like this app a lot. Now they're replacing all their language workers with AI. Bots can't make good language curriculums. Quality of lessons is already decreasing, and it's only been a couple days. Not renewing my super family plan this year."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really love this app with ONE GIANT EXCEPTION! I wish the words i have learned thus far were LISTED somewhere on the app, so I can review my full vocabulary. Seems like a staggering oversight. Other than that, I love it, but that one glaring issue was worth a loss of two stars because it is constantly a pain in the butt as I review my knowledge so far. It takes much more time in internet research than it COULD take if it were simply listed somewhere within the app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The rate languages they advertise are short. I completed Latin in 4 months, and it didn't have all the same features as other languages. Like, other languages have grammar lessons, Latin had NONE! Other languages have stories. Latin had none. They advertise learning rare and dead languages. They don't help you at all. I'm very disappointed. I have paid monthly for over a year and cannot get them to fix simple problems. One problem is having a correct answer that is constantly marked wrong."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is absolutely amazing! It's like a game that teaches you languages. The lessons are interactive, engaging, and addictive. I'm learning so much and having a blast. (‚Å†‚òÜ‚Å†‚ñΩ‚Å†‚òÜ‚Å†)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I wouldn't recommend this app. I think it's a good starting place for getting the foundations of language, but after that you'd be better off doing your own study with revision books and such - eg for Japanese do JLPT exercises. It does stuff like ""update"" the course and you get set back multiple stages and do things you've already learnt. Sometimes you'll get trained on the same word hundreds of times as if you've never seen it then get given a word you've never seen in a test?? Just not great"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is one of the best language apps. Thanks to the Duolingo app, I've learned three more languages and advanced in my current ones. Now, I can communicate in six different languages."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I didn't think Duolingo would be this great, so I avoided it for a while and tried other apps. But Duolingo has helped me so much! It's easy to understand and it's fun to do lessons. I love Duolingo. 9/10 would recommend. The only issue is the prices for Super Duolingo. They're unreasonable prices and I don't think I'd ever want to pay that much at once. If they made their prices more reasonable I'd use the app more."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Am so grateful for this app I am getting to learn language without anyone lecturing me you are wrong or disempowering me. It make me want to learn more. I had to remove 3 star as the more I learn I notice it was teaching me to shame people emotions and it's heart breaking. It kept wanting me to repeat those programing words.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really like the application and it makes learning new languages a lot easier. But the newer layout of the main page as one large path, instead of the old one with blocks of lessons, is more diffcult to use. It makes the learning a little more rigid then is useful. As well making it more diffcult to find the lessons I want to do, including the stories. Also, and I'm not sure if its just my phone, but the layout causes a lot of lag. I hope the layout returns to the previous one. Still like it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"As you progress farther in, each unit gets longer. I've started to resent the refresher lessons because they're holding me back from progressing. It can feel quite repetitive to do the same things over and over. Additionally, the lack of grammar explanations is the pits, and makes it difficult to apply my learning to other things. I understand that there used to be very good explanations. I can't fathom why they would actively remove that. Additional OPTIONAL context is never a hindrance."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is the best app you can use if you want to learn a language. It has step by step instructions, less adds, high motivation and easy ways to help you learn. If you are looking for a language learning app then install this one."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a fun app that makes learning the basics engaging and enjoyable. The characters and gamification with XP and items are a cool touch. My biggest frustration is that it doesn't do a good job with speech recognition, making the speaking parts incredibly frustrating. I'm told ""that's incorrect"" even though I mimic the sample like a parrot, & I don't even know why I'm wrong. Improving this would make it a 5 star app. As is, it's a good place to start your learning journey, but not much more."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app only opens when it wants to. Such a disappointment. I was making progress without missing a day and the app refuse to open beyond the loading page. A disappointment.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is a complicated review... the app is great, and the progression through languages is awesome. However, monetization is very aggressive when you consider that their mission is to make learning a new language ""free"". You see, a lot of people, including myself, learn by making mistakes, but in the app, you can only make 5 mistakes in a row and then you have to ""practice"" (which is interesting but defeats the ""progress is better than perfect"" moto) or wait 15 hours (?!)."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've been learning Duolingo Spanish for 3 years and have adapted to many changes that have been rolled out, which is part of being on an app that is constantly improving the experience. I rate Duolingo 5 stars for the fun, small bite approach to learning a language. I rate them 1 star for learner support. All too often, the app reverses my progress requiring me to redo lessons I have already completed. I'm a dedicated learner, and I find this demotivating. I've given up reporting the problem. ü§∑"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoy learning in this intuitve way, though being older and having been taught in a more rigid, structured way all my life it takes getting used to at first. The goals, challenges and leagues make the process fun and keep you motivated when you start to flag and are not unachievable, so you don't lose heart on days when you are not doing so well. One thing I would like to see is a dictionary of verbs regarding the different tenses and application of gender specific changes."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It used to be possible to skip one sub-level by clicking on the key, now you have to either do everything or skip all of it to go to the next level. It's so annoying especially when you have very good knowledge in some of the topics (let's say there are eight exercises about fruit vocabulary) but you are less good at past tense; if both are in the same ""section"", it gets really frustrating having to go through all the fruit stuff just to get to the relevant part. It really kills it for me."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I REALLY liked the old format better where you could choose which lessons you did instead of the single-track courses they do no, but if you just do it, even one lesson a day, and you pay not to have ads or deal with hearts, it will teach you a language. Couldn't stand it with the ads. Also the SPEAKING FUNCTION DOES NOT WORK!! This used to be a primary feature of the app, then it went away completely for years, now it's back but broken?? LOL. Yikes. ü§∑"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app starts out great, and I've definitely learned a bit. But after learning some simple words, it throws you right into sentences without explaining structure, word modifiers, etc. I've only been getting by because I can click on the words to see what they mean, and I can deduce what the sentences are by context or because the lessons are repetitive. I don't actually know what's what, though, and I don't know if I'd ever be able to fully learn a language through Duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a good app for learning languages. The interface is good, no clutter, the teaching pace is good for French. But the Hindi lessons are very repetitive and some sounds of letters in 'learn the letters' are wrong. That needs to be corrected. Also, the alternating male and female voices for different words is a bit disorienting while listening. One uniform voice in a single sentence during listening exercises, would be better and less confusing."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app and it helped me greatly since I've been using it consistently every day for 30 minutes for almost a year. Especially when I started reading everything out loud, not just speaking exercises, if you don't do that you loose a lot. But what I don't like, it's the absence of grammer tips (this section only has examples, no tips) and at level 5 the grammer gets more complex. So I need to find out what this grammer rule is about, then search for it and read myself, which takes time."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo used to be much better because there was a key function which allowed you to test out of individual levels (this way you could move onto a new topic much faster if you mastered it in, say, 3 rather than the full 10 or twenty lessons). Now, you only have the option to test out of much larger units, which is a great deal harder to do, and so your overall progress is extremely slow, while also being much too easy. The vocab is very repetitive and overly simplistic as well. Very bad, alas."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The good: you can learn a bunch of vocabulary in your chosen language. Not-so-good: a LOT is left out (you'll definitely need supplementary resources to actually converse in a language). And the balance is way off. For example, in the Spanish course, you'll use ""elegante"" every day, but never need it in real life. In Japanese, 50 or 60 consecutive lessons repeated the same handful of words, then suddenly there were six new words in every lesson."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is fantastic! I love the way it simply teaches you how the language is spoken rather than focusing on diagramming sentences. Update, they keep ""updating"" the app and every time they do, it moves you to a completely different point in the program. Then you're expected to suddenly know and understand a LOT of vocabulary that you have never seen before. Then you might see any given new vocabulary once every great while so you never get a chance to actually learn any of it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It pains me to give the app two stars. When I first started Duolingo, I would've given it five stars. The trees were great, and being able to learn words by category was fun. I not only finished the Irish tree, but got each category to legendary. When the path system was introduced, I was open-minded, but didn't like that I ""lost"" progress. It sent me back a few sections, forcing me to either do them again, or take a test to regain my level. After three updates and re-sets, I'm sick of it all."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy using Duolingo. The lessons are fun and allow me to learn at my own pace. A couple of things could be improved: First, it can take a while for content errors to be corrected, even when flagged. Second, I don't like how new course content is introduced. Rather than putting you back several levels on the learning path, it would make more sense to roll out new content via a dedicated tab."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I used to have this when it was in the early stages and it needed A LOT of work, but the concept and execution were awesome. I tried it again last year and they have really cleaned up errors, provide examples and explanations and the repetition of ""writing"", speaking and listening are really solidifying my experience with my chosen language. I currently have super and it is worth it. I practise daily as I'm very serious now. Library books and this as a supplement have really helped."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I, like a lot of other people, hate the new learning path, I wish to be able to review specific lessons. Otherwise I like the game aspect of learning, and I appreciate that the app is free, although the ads sometimes get excessive. Edit: boosters are no longer awarded after the end of a level, which makes competing frustrating and borderline impossible for me. Also reward from the hardest daily goal is always a booster, which feels pushy and kinda ridiculous, as it gets ~25 mins to get there"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Kept me engaged nonstop for a few years and I'm definitely making progress learning the language! Lessons are easy enough, yet the daily quests are still challenging if you don't have a Super version. There is a stunning amount of variation in forming the sentences. So far I love Duolingo. A disadvantage is playing super aggressive loud ads any time of the day. At least they aren't played unexpectedly, which could make the app unusable."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been using the app for about 6 years. The app encouraged me to complete more levels. I did, and I worked to finish quite a few levels (even as legendary) despite not fully internalizing all the new vocabulary. Recent changes won't let me review old lessons, so I'm stuck. I need to review my vocabulary, but the app won't let me. My daily lessons are real short. I immediately encounter 5 vocabulary errors, and I'm done for the day. It's depressing."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is awesome! There are times when it asks you frequently to buy the pro with no ads but it doesn't withhold anything that's essential or helpful to learn. It makes it easy and fun with the way it's organized, it has multiple cartoony characters with their own personalities, and it keeps on encouraging you to keep going with streak but you can also earn streak freezes for occasional days you miss. It's personal to you. I definitely recommend. I couldn't find anything better. Love it!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A bit annoyed by the frequent changes, for example in the last update I lost legendary status on almost all my lessons and I was set back a lot because a huge number of new units was added, plus I got a bunch of new words appearing in my lessons which were not categorized as new even though they never appeared in any of the lessons I finished before. So basically, stop updating all the time! Still, I have to say a huge thanks, I wouldn't learn nowhere near as much without this app. GRAZIE MILLE!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Updated my rating. Last year, I enjoyed this, although I was unhappy with the constant pressure to use it. But they have changed their flexible lessons into a forced path, which is completely unhelpful. It has ruined a previously great learning experience. I canceled my subscription as a result and am looking at other language apps. Also, there's huge problems in the programming now - mistakes in the app and in the lessons. Instead, they add cutesy animation. They're priorities are backwards."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's Ok for keeping a daily practice regime, however I find that after one year the learning system will hit a wall. This varies for each language. For example, the exercises aren't good enough to grasp German cases, the nuances of Welsh spelling, the rules of French diacritics, or French du/de articles. At these moments the endless repetition with little or no explanation falls short."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It WAS great, but then they 'updated' the app (according to them to provide a better learning experience) and now it's sooo full of ads that you can't concentrate. I simply cannot afford the super/ad-free version, but prior to the update had been doing quite well with the free version as it was. Now my learning is affected by the repeated, and way more numerous, distractions. Disheartening disappointment."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Lessons seem very slow-paced and repetitive (for Japanese), and plans frequently change. Also, it marks me wrong when I'm certain I'm right...answers aren't flexible. I prefer to learn languages how native people speak. Also, sometimes my progress regresses in lessons or my streak isn't extended despite having some Duolingo that day. There are bugs that definitely become bothersome. Improvements can definitely be made, but it still is a go-to app for practice alongside language learning classes."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely hate this app! The new set is awful! It is very discouraging and is no longer fun. It does a horrible job at teaching grammar and will throw in brand new words during the ""tests"" at the end of a lesson! You just have to figure it out yourself by getting things wrong. Also, the app is flawed. There are times when it has two options that are exactly the same or have two answers that would work in the sentence. And the new timed testing is unrealistic; who can type that fast!?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The limited number of hearts is frustrating since you lose them even if you used a synonym. I get that it's a marketing technique, but for the sake of functionality there should be an ""I was correct"" option like in Quizlet. The Swedish oral exercises with only one word are broken (a native speaker tested this for me). I also don't like how I keep getting time-consuming beginner level exercises (like numbers and colors) randomly. But I guess it's alright if you don't speak the language at all."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's so incredibly fun. I love playing with friends along with completing the friend quests. I get super competitive and leagues are a great way to challenge yourself along with the special events that let you get extra xp. The only problem I've had is the fact that I haven't been able to access the new lessons, music and math. I've tried countless times to update, restart, delete and download, but i just cant seem to access it. I dont plan on using them frequently, but I'd like the option."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Firstly the app is great for learning. You can correct your mistakes and complete challenges with friends. There are some issues though. When you're competing in the leagues, you compete against other people of different courses and levels, thus, its not fair. For example, its unfair to compare someone who practices English with someone who practices Russian or Korean, and someone who has been practicing for 2 years with someone who has been practicing for 2 months."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I had a friend and several family members recommend Duolingo, so I downloaded the app. So far, it's been fun and keeps my interest. I'm enjoying it. Update: Lately, the app has been slow to open, sometimes not opening at all. I simply get the green Duolingo opening screen, and everything stops there. Now, the app is freezing during play. Very frustrating. I'm still having issues with the app freezing on the opening screen. I can't get to the lesson this morning.üòî"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"If you want an app that functions like a simple game, it's great. If you want more explanation on things like demonstrative pronouns, and noun genders, it's not great. I'm learning Polish, and using google to fill in the parts that aren't taught in Duolingo. The app itself is pretty smooth and easy to use. The commercials are way too loud compared to the lessons, and there is a constant push towards the paid version, which is a turn off."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have been using this app for about 10 years. I enjoy the speaking and listening parts, but many times the audio is either not picking up my voice or there is a problem with my new (8 month) phone. This happens about 2-3 times per week and it results in you losing a point each time. I have commented on it every time, but no response from Duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Positives: Sentence-based learning helps contextualise learning. Sentences in multiple voices help adjust to different tones and ways of speaking. Progression through levels quite good motivation. Negatives: Super Duolingo adverts becoming increasingly intrusive and annoying. Way too little material and too repetitive at the advanced stage of at least the Japanese course. Too inflexible with acceptable answers, especially when choosing to not use the ""word order choice"" format and go free-text."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo for me has been really good in terms of learning, in all aspects, but there are some parts that I wish that could be changed. In the newest update, they removed the bar telling you how long of that specific achievement you need to advance to the next level (i.e. early riser achievement) so I wish that could be added back so I can keep track of my progress. But overall, 4 stars."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It is an ok app. Updates tend to change format structure. ""Correct"" responses are often inconsistent when it pertains to using articles and pronouns within an answer. It often becomes ""guess what I'm thinking"" in terms of including the article or pronoun in a response. Hints to aid in learning are frequently wrong . Previous versions were more helpful in learning from mistakes. The app has some competitiveness to it. There is a decent amount of choices of languages to learn."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It offers content that is helpful & which has a variety of options such as pronunciation, typing, selection etc. However, features such as retrying mistakes, unlimited hearts etc.. can only be accessed with 'Super Duolingo' - a monetised extention of existing features. While I understand that the app should have available a feature that generates income, the 'lives' system is a significant hindrance. It would be generally useful to make unlimited hearts an unpaid feature."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Update: as I've continued to use the new system and as they've updated it like 5 more times, it's actually gotten decent again. I like it again now I absolutely LOVED the old set up. Used it for over a year. Felt like it really allowed my to move forward with learning as well as reviewing old lessons. Really, really enjoyed it. I do NOT like the new set up. It's so frustrating I'm thinking of dropping Duolingo and switching over to something else. Why did they have to go and ruin a great thing?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Updated Oct 2023. I've been studying almost 3 years and it does the job. It improves periodically with new sentences, course layouts, and character voices. Great blog too. But (for German) Duo is awful at teaching grammar. You will need significant outside refs, videos, etc. They removed the forum, so I often don't even know why my answer was wrong and just have to memorize the correct one (that's not learning). They've also padded the courses with a lot more repetitive material than before."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's ok. Could be better. The hearts count count be higher and the streak cancelation is Definitely very discouraging, though. You lose motivation after you have reached a big number and then see it drop to 0. They're really shooting themselves on the foot with that because I'm sure more people would visit the app longer if they felt motivated to instead of discouraged. But I guess, not all business models are the best."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"As a long-time customer, I can say that some changes are welcome: I like the one track path through each segment and the test to qualify you to jump to the next segment. However, what happened to the ability to converse in a thread with others when you don't understand why you got something wrong? That was very helpful. On an aesthetic level, I'm also disappointed that the animations went away; they were fun."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"been using this app for years and the changes seem to be quite arbitrary and designed to drive sales of premium subscriptions rather than to make learning better. navigation is more difficult, with areas hidden behind sections. lessons are no longer labeled by topic, only by unit, so if I want to review an area I have no idea what to click. also, I've completed the full lessons all the way through TWICE, but after the latest update, my progress no shows."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great way to learn the vocabulary. Makes the whole thing fun and reminds me to keep it up. Also finding a competitive group is an excellent idea. Triggers my need to be the best, which steps up my game nicely. Only major downside is that it keeps pushing for super Duolingo but I cannot find an actual cost anywhere. It just says after the free trial you will be charged. I don't like this scam vibe. Be open about your prices or get deleted."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoy this app, you can tell all the detail and work the creators put into the app. The different voices for each character who have different personalities fits very well, all the bright colors and collaborative choices with friends and quests are super different! I know some people don't like how you have to repeat a lesson so many times to complete it, but for me, I think the repetition is most important when learning a new language. I would highly recommend this app to new learners."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app overall for learning a language (alongside practice of course). However lately (fall 2023), lots of adjustments in the courses took place and twice I was taken back some units for no reason and had to go through the units again, which is not motivating at all as well as frustrating. Devs should always keep in mind that, while they have new ideas, users may not want them ! Please do something in that regard."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing. I never took a language in high school and I've always wished I were bilingual growing up. I never would have thought Learning a new language in my 30's would be this easy or this fun. I highly recommend this app to anyone and everyone wanting to learn a new language at any age. But, BEWARE of the free trial with super Duolingo cuz I never got the 2 day reminder before they charged me for it, and the total is for a whole year of $6.99 (like $90 something bucks, bruh...) So watch out!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have been using Duolingo for over one year. I like it a lot. It's a little childish, but it makes it fun I suppose. I would like it to do a better job with vocabulary exercises. It tends to teach several new words and then quizzes you on old words but not the new words. They should offer more timed vocabulary exercises. But overall, I think they make the tedious process of learning a language fun. Good job Duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Duolingo for several years and it has been invaluable in getting to know my new language. Having it handy on my phone means I can practice learning at any occasion when I've got a spare 5 minutes. The app itself is very good, runs well with no bugs. Even the free version is not top heavy with adverts. Highly recommended."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"While the timing of what you learn is a bit... odd (I've learned how to say food in many languages before learning the base of a proper sentence), it still gets the job done. In fact, I'd say it does better than other apps, it keeps everything interesting instead of the most boring lessons you've ever seen. Keep up the work. (Also I heard they're adding music and that's a major plus if it's true)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very fun way to learn but extremely disappointed to hear they're laying off many of their employees and replacing them with AI just to save money. They already have merchandise, advertisements and subscriptions. It's not right to do and I can only see it making the app worse, I hope they will reconsider."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"very good if you commit to it. however some audio could be better, like you can't hear every word in a sentence and sometimes even if you speak clearly into the microphone it doesn't register every word you say. some words have capital letters for to start a sentence when choosing the words in exercise and you don't pass if you don't put the capital letters first in the sentence even if there's two ""The, the"" and the order should be irrelevant."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Great app, but wish there was a vocabulary list and a little grammar guidance. I left my original review because it was great. I have been stuck at reviewing unit 4. On the computer it showed 1 through 8 that I had completed, but I could go back and work on Legendary. Now that is down to units 1 to 3. After weeks of this I am tired of doing the same exercises over and over. I am leaving until it gets fixed. I am working on Latin and the Legentibus app is great. This was 4 stars, but now 1."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo used to be very good. I have been using it to learn French for almost 4 years. But in 2023 the format changed and now, although I've no where near completed the course, the exercises are too easy and I'm not learning much e.g. I'm often doing 5 exercises in a row without making a single mistake. I believe an 80% success rate is optimum for learning - so Duolingo is far off that. There is too much repetition of tasks I've succeeded at before and not enough explanation of new grammar etc"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I decided to replace my doom scrolling with finally learning Japanese. It's not perfect, but considering it's free with extremely minimal ads, it's amazing. If I could give some feedback on the app side of it: I'd LOVE for an option to turn up the voices and turn down the sound effects. I know you can turn sound effects off but my ideal would just be to balance it to my liking since I'd like to have both on, but sound effects are significantly louder than voices."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I started from I KNOW SOME WORDS AND PHRASES. Jumped right in at a level which was both challenging and remedial. Progressing quickly and incorporating previous lesson material is interesting. This app does well encouraging you to engage. Very important in retention. I don't enjoy the game aspect, but it's not too obtrusive. Acceptable. Overall it's a great app to jump into if, like me, you didn't know which to choose, but didn't want to spend $üíØ!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is great, but please, you need to move the bottom "" I can't hear now"", for somewhere far from the bottom "" verify"". It's really frustrating when you're going to verify the answer and by mistake push the wrong option, consequently turning off the exercises that need to be listened to. However, it's just a little thing easy to be solved, the app itself is really good!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The best language learning app, it's free, there is no limit to how many languages you can learn at one time, courses have really clear structure and the paid subscription is relatively cheap (please duo, I need to see my family, it's been a year now)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to be great, but it's gotten way worse suddenly. After the UI refresh it crashes a lot more, and the new UI ""looks"" nicer, at the cost of not being intuitive or concise in any way (lessons are way less packed now, so you have to scroll a ton up and down to review lessons). As for Spanish, they're now teaching a much more formal way (usted, etc). They changed their pricing model as well. Gone is Duolingo+ ($7) it's now ""SUPER"" Duolingo ($12.50). It's the same thing, but more expensive."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"You really don't have to pay to use it, I did 1 year learning pretty much every day without paying anything at all. I now have the premium version (¬£60/year) which I find really handy to have as on days that I roll, I can just keep going and going until I don't want to anymore, whereas before I could only make 4 mistakes and then had to wait for a new life. It works too, but I feel I learn easier with the premium version. 100% recommended, the key I think is to do little but often."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"""It's about progress, not perfection"", yet you are punished for not doing it all perfectly. The hints are wrong more and more often and reporting it doesn't seem to do anything. Audio isn't normalised, so some words are spoken sofly, and the NEXT very LOUDLY. Speaking exercises are broken and have never worked. There is still, after all these years and requests, not a medium listening speed. And on top of it all, they removed the discussions, so now there is even less explanation."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing and I use it every day(despite my streak freezes) purely because it's fun and my friends love it too. This app is close to perfection and has an amazing community of people. If there were one thing to add, remove and change they would be: to add a personal dictionary to see the words you have learned and their meanings, change back the duolingo-style avatar creator (though it might just not be working for me), and to have a toggle for suggesting watching ads for extra hearts"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Every single month they ""update"" their courses and moving me around seemingly at random. Suddenly I'm dealing with a bunch of words that are way too basic and a bunch of words I've never heard of. It's awful and really prevents you from actually learning anything. On top of that, the reminder notifications are super aggro and keep hounding you multiple times a day unless you turn them off entirely. I don't want a dozen ""we'll end your streak"" notifications every day. Needs major work."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've spent 22 days learning Chinese and the experience was good. But as far as I reached the ""explorer"" version I met 3 bugs, reportes them in app several times and none of them were fixed in the following 3 days. I tried to send report on their website, but it was also broken. I do really like the app and I'll continue learning, but it is so frustrating not to have any feedback or support when you met any issues."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It used to be great. But now, every time they do an update, it moves me into things where I have absolutely no idea what's going on, to the point that I don't even try to make progress anymore out of pure frustration. Just to see, I went back multiple sections that duo had automatically marked me as competent in, and those lessons also had things I'd never heard of. I'm on a 2000+ day streak and I'm ready to quit because duo is so bad now."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Oh how the mighty fall. Every year or two, Duolingo redoes their interface, adding flash while removing substance. The latest iteration is a case study in flashy but terrible UX design. Lesson icons no longer correspond to content, nor indicate the time since they were last practiced, and all lessons are on an infinite scroll path. This makes review miserable. All you can do is forge ahead, and if you take time off, the only help you'll get is a meaningless ~10 question ""mini-review."" Not good."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,love it .. I like the incentives that they used to help you to continue to engage even though sometimes you want to slip. and the little encouraging characters when you get things right always makes you feel great. I think I could benefit from maybe a quick overview or understanding or video on how to conjugate the verbs rather than trying to figure it out and lose hearts. but it's a great app and it's free.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I 100% finished the Japanese course a year ago, then they changed the format from the skill tree to the linear path, and placed me further back. I thought that they added new lessons and new words to learn, but they didn't. I haven't learned a single new word in the past year from Duolingo. The ads are annoying and sometimes they bug, so your only option is to close app and potentially lose XP. Words in the ""Match Madness"" are frequently glitched and don't load completely. Pretty bad app overall"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The lessons and all that are fine and helpful, but the passive aggressive reminders to practice drive me nuts. I would probably use it more if I could just set a time that's good for me to get a reminder and it was just a bland ""do you want to practice today?"" I don't need some sad emoji trying to make me feel bad all day for being busy. And I don't really care about streaks either. A number of days a week goal would be great and more realistic."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love the app, but the app keeps bugging, right after I finish a lesson. It tries to load into the lesson's statistics - or sometimes into the menu, but never does. So I have to close the app and I lose all of my progress, for the daily quests, but not the lessons. It's infuriating and takes away from the experience. I don't get Super Duolingo for this reason. What's the point of paying for something that bugs so much and doesn't give me my rewards, in the end?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app, the design and the user experience is nice, but... the same sentences that are repeated over and over again.. Please, do something with that.. More variety of expressions is needed. I no longer have the motivation to use the app because I have translated the same sentences at least 70-80 times each. You have the feeling that you remain at the begginer level without advancing any further."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've used the ad version regularly for 2 years and occasionally for 3 years before that. Very effective for learning a language and very engaging. But program has some bugs, which they generally find and fix in new versions (only to add new bugs). If you use the ad version past the 2nd level, they make it difficult to progress to encourage you to subscribe and pay."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There's a ""progress"" bug happening. I've completed a whole unit for Spanish (doing the lessons, little quiz stories and such) and was about halfway through my current unit, until the other day, when I opened the app, my unit had been completely reset! I was more than halfway through, because I remember doing the story quizzes and everything. So, I redo the ones I've done, and everything is great..until this morning. Back to square ONE. Duolingo is a great app, but please fix this bug."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app is useful for learning and communicating with people that talk another language... The app starts in a great way but andthen it's very frustrating and they give you words that you still haven't learned and whenever you lose your heart(s) you have to do extra exercises to continue and the controls on a PC or laptop are harder then controls on a mobile and each level are almost the same and they sometimes give you words that you haven't learned and I don't know if I will ever learn from it
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Lots of good learning. But overlay gamed, it gets stressful trying to stay in a league or go up. Boosts appear and you can't save them so you have to use them at that time, even if real world get in the way. It's actually better not to play than have a bad week and go down a league. I've quite and come back often because I need time away from the xp demand. Duo could be the next Squid Games."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, it's very addictive once you try it. But it gives you a few easy words, then after even if you get them all incorrect; it starts giving full sentences. And new words. It's frustrating. Even if I push "" Start From Scratch"" it gives you one easy word, then it gets really hard. But overall, it's a really nice app. A really addictive way of learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is a great app for learning a language, it's easy to engage with and the content is very effective. My only issue with it is that there are too many fingers constantly tweaking the interface. While the learning material continues to improve, other aspects are often changed for the worse. I really preferred the old interface before the current learning paths. But I have to give credit that I've seen great results in my Spanish progression from daily use of this app and that matters most"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"During the 3 months after I started learning Spanish, Duolingo has reset the course 2 times and I was migrated backwards with content. I don't seem to make any real progress. Some exercises I passed in the very beginning are now repeating again. A lot of words are introduced as ""new"", although they aren't. Also I use the desktop version and occasionally it won't sync up with mobile version - lessons I already passed on desktop, I have to repeat again on mobile. This is frustrating experience."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"All right so it's been a while and I've been using Duolingo for a while before I left a review, let me start with some good things basically they give you a lot for free that's undeniable. But the real damning thing about Duolingo is the pentagogy is terrible, you get the feeling there were a lot of IT people and linguists involved in making this and not a single teacher amongst them. Random words being thrown at you barely any tutelage to figure it out."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app! For the first few units. I have been using this app for about two months and have learned about 200+ words. Though it was easy and fun to learn at first isn't and doesn't teach well when you have to do longer sentences. I am learning German and sometimes words are differently ordered because of course its a different language. But duolingo doesn't really clarify it. Though ""practice makes perfect"" you need to be actually taught than just have questions being thrown at you."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is an AMAZING app for learning different languages, but there are some issues for me at least. There are way to many ads, and the only way you can get rid of them is if you purchase Super Duolingo. Another issue is that some people don't have any streak freeze, so if they miss a day on accident, they could lose a streak for like 34 days or something. Aside from all those issues, I must admit, Duolingo is a wonderful app, and amazing for learning new languages in my opinion."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have only one problem with Duolingo: if there is one instance when you can't do a spoken exercise and you tap on that, you never get those back. I checked the settings everywhere, in the browser, in the app, and everything looks as it should, yet I am not able to do spoken exercises. I logged out, back in, deactivated and reactivated the settings = nothing. Disappointing."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love this little app. It makes learning languages fun and visually appealing. I enjoy moving up leagues based on progress and effort and the fact that you get rewards for that. Being able to buy streak freezes as well is great because sometimes when you have a busy weekend, or go on vacation, you can use these to protect your streak, if you don't have time to practice. The grammar rules could maybe be a bit more extensive but other than that a great app, which I highly recommend."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Fun and educational; it would be nice to be able to look up a grammar rule instead of trying to figure some things out on my own. When I can also use my bonuses (such as ""chests"" for double points for 15 minutes, etc.) on the website on my PC, I'll consider paying for this. It's a bit pointless to give me a double-point ""reward"" when I'm already in a double-point session with time remaining, as it actually gives me nothing..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"i really love this app, it's gotten me so far in learning multiple languages, but the bugs lately are really horrible. i keep getting moved around, back and forth, sometimes by entire units. lately, when i complete a lesson half the time it doesn't even register,and i have to do it over again to advance, sometimes multie times in a row. even the xp doesn't get counted. at the time of writing im number one in the diamond league for the first time, but it won't be for long because i can't gain xp."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Used to enjoy this app and I found it fun, but I'm unmotivated with it now, I was happy to be moving forward with my course but just like the other reviews after an update it just takes you back to courses I completed 3 months ago, this is the third time I've had to do a test to skip again. I'm bored of having to constantly repeat lessons that I'm not learning, I get asked the same questions multiple times in one lesson, It's too repetitive and hardly any advancement, just a waste of time now."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Some things I really enjoy about this app, the fact that it's free (with limited features, but still!), and I do think the learning style has good research behind it. The competitiveness helps me, as you compete with other learners. There are few grammatical explanations (I'm leaning Chinese), and sometimes there are misspellings, or seemingly confusing teaching (two pronunciations for the same word with no explanation). Also, it regularly doesn't give me the ""coins"" I earn, for some reason."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The Only Free Place to Learn Din√© (Navajo)! I was suprised at the accuracy, which a native speaker double checked the program and approved it. It does go too quickly to spelling, which I find super hard! I would like to learn more vocab. Also, the app doesn't let you spell some words accurately so you can't progress. I hope they will fix this and I have brought this to their attention. Also, I hope, that they will add audio to help with pronouncing their words. The subscription is expensive!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"On 450 day steak right now. The app is super fun, interactive with full of challenges to do and badges to collect. Kinda gets addictive and becomes a part of my identity. I just can't not do it every day. At first, you may wonder if it's really gonna help you learn, or you feel that you're not making much progress, or that the constant repetition is boring. But it does pay off!! It makes you learn sentence structures, words and expressions of that language subconsciously through repetition."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's great when I first used it, the only problem is when I'm using my mic to speak, it always says, ""hmm, that doesn't sound right"", it always listens and inculdes the background sound. Also, when there is this ""matching the words"" sometimes, it crashes and/or lags. Last time when I tried this to learn French which was in 2020, it was was perfectly well, until I installed it again last month, it definitely changed which is alright but it constantly crashes. Please fix this Duolingo. Thank you!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duo typically does very little explaining of concepts in most languages I've tried on their platform, preferring instead to simply correct errors and leave you wondering why. Duo does have a wide selection of languages to choose from, but use caution if you have no prior experience with a language you want to learn: it is possible to learn a language that way on Duolingo, but it may be very frustrating to be corrected repeatedly on something and never receive an explanation of *why*."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Definitely make it fun to learn but could be made better overall. Ex. The words aren't explained well, like in Irish: ""teach t√°bhairne"" is ""the pub,"" if you click on the word, it doesn't break it down -you're left wondering which words are which or how. Some audio is spoken differently/not clearly, so you have to slow it down each time, which makes the flash events hard to win. Which word is correct? Overall, I wish they'd just let you learn without having to spend substantial bucks on a sub."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,great so far. love that it's free and that theres only 1 short ad after a lesson. I expect it to have longer ads and there to be more but it doesn't. No complaints. Edit: 10/13/23 I took a star off because the app at random doesn't save a lesson done for the day and I end up losing a streak freeze. It seems to be happening more frequently and today I know I did a lesson and went through claiming all the rewards. I got a notification saying I had so long to extend the streak despite doing it.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Creative, but translation isn't great. The animations are appealing, and the format is simple. Though translations are not always correct. The limited amount of hearts is hindering. I am not able to progress as quickly as I could if they were unlimited. (You can have unlimited hearts if you purchase Super Duolingo. Very expensive; USA= $6.99 per month, UK= ¬£4.99 per month,Australia= $10.83). Overall, a great app to start off with, but it does have its flaws."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app used to have specific lessons on different topics, so you could prioritise what you wanted to learn. It's now just a winding chain of identical lessons, with no control for the user. They've also added a feature where if you don't practice for a while, you have to do a ""refresher"" - which means 3 lessons of repeating basic greetings and numbers before you're allowed to do anything else. It feels as if the app is increasingly designed just to be gamified, not to learn a language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I've been playing duolingo for several days. Overall a great learning app with many features although there is just one problem I've been facing: I have taken part in the Indonesian course. But It isn't showing my friends quest status even though I've taken part in it. I am not able to view my progress in the quest. If you could look into that it'd be great. Thank you.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"makes learning fun. I like the different methods of learning. it could improve upon the content provided - kind of going in blindly in terms of grammar and rules. the way the lessons are organized is kind of random. I learn about students and libraries before being able to ask where the bathroom is. finally, seems like every time the app has an update, it messes with the lessons I've gotten legendary status on."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Quite good, although I don't recommend it for people who really want to get fluent with the chosen language, just go to a school for that, but if u want to learn basic responses then this is the app for you. I went to Japan and I could order food, ask for directions and locations pretty easily, basic responses and questions :) . Overall I just feel the app loads a bit slow and the ads are a bit annoying."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Duolingo daily for over three months now. Duo lingo is a great app. I do suggest using it along side a book or other methods to learn basic sentence structure, verb conjugation and other rules. The app would be greatly improved if it had areas/material on these things. I have noticed that the free version gives much more basic level practice vs the pay version gives more complex sentences and lessons. The pay version is worth the money IF you use it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App itself has many flaws. Very bad at deciding which dictionary language to use during lessons. The matching game has terrible lag, leading to a number of errors because I move too fast for it to keep up. Reasonably ok at the lessons, but not very good at explaining things. (""Tells"" but doesn't teach.) Recent changes (""cost"" more gems to do things, not giving you all the gems you've earned when you finish two challenges at once) make me consider switching to a different app. Can't recommend it."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've used Duolingo for years. When it works, it's great. The problem is that it has not worked correctly for several months. I have reported the problem at least 2 times (use of speaking exercises causes android phone to die and restart). No response from Duo and no help even with the paid version. I'll find a less frustrating language app. Also, the removal of discussions was a BIG negative... Duo lost his way. And, the avatars are juvenile and ugly."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is definitely one of the best and easiest ways to learn a new language! It forces you into creating a routine but also creates some rivalries with fellow language students. The XP system really pushes you to work extra hard to get into the top 10. (and extra extra hard to get to the number one place!) Besides that, there is a couple things that could be better. -More variety with the use of words in same sections of courses -Use of GPT4 for the actual lessons (more authenti exercises)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"For the sake of competition, the learning track moves one ahead too quickly, at the expense of retaining what was learned. For example, it is more appropriate to say that one is 'exposed' to the vocabulary rather than 'learned' the vocabulary. Perhaps giving more points for reviewing past lessons might help encourage more reviewing. Also, on my phone, the audio volume of the lessons is too low. I have to increase the volume to hear them. Then, I have my ears hurt by the advertisements!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Strangest bugs that need to be fixed. In one activity, the right tiles were not available to be chosen, so I opted to type it in instead. My answer was correct, but again it was not presented on the tiles. In the speaking exercises, I repeated phrases verbatim, but they would not be accepted. These bugs only started recently after getting the 3 free days of super duolingo. These mistakes did not cost me any hearts, thankfully, but if these continue after my free trial I will try Babbel instead."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Great app for learning languages. Unfortunately there is no reasonable price option for monthly payments. I am happy to pay the yearly cost per month. As i think its worth it. You have to pay for a year upfront. Which isnt an option for me. The free option is OK but the frequent adverts get annoying and discourages myself and kids from using the app.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"If you want an app that can give you a strong start to learning a language, Duolingo is hard to beat. With writing, speaking, and listening exercises, it has everything you need to train yourself to speak and think in another language. Pair that with its competitive leaderboards for extra motivation to practice steadily, you'd be hard pressed to find a more effective beginner level (and higher) language learning app. It's honestly some of the most fun I've had learning anything."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Easy and well done. *Update: They have more ads for the upgrade that are longer than previous ads, and are unable to be skipped. Many reviews state that the app doesn't really teach the language, they just throw you in and expect you to guess. This isn't 100% true. At the begining of every section/Chapter, there is a workbook button you can click that explains what that section is teaching. Since you aren't forced to view this before starting a lesson, I think some people don't know it is there."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"5 for keeping me working on my languages every day for over 3 years, & for providing a free option. I chose to pay to avoid ads. I did find it frustrating to learn words like 'camel' & 'hamster' instead of useful phrases, but each language is presented differently. Duolingo will help you to get started & keep working on it regularly, but you need to do additional work. Try not to be drawn into the competitive aspect as it makes you focus on points instead of new learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great to build up a pool of vocabularly in record time. The characters and stories are fun. Bite-sized learning blocks for every day. The learning experience is playful and you can do how much you like and at your level. It doesn't provide explanations to grammar and structural rules. This can be frustrating and requires patience to figure it out yourself by applying logic. It doesn't repeat enough the things you have learned at any given time. Therefore you may loose it again.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"So, I have been on Duolingo for 61 days. I like everything in it except for one thing. Match Madness. I feel like you could make that more easier. It's in two things. First, in the place where you want to get xp for the leaderboard and second when you click on an animation. The last stage is impossible, when you try to finish it, it won't work. It's like forcing you to buy the row blaster to win. Please make Match Madness easier."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm doing Spanish, and it doesn't teach well with masculine and feminine words (examples: El perro, La mujer), so it's confusing to first-time learners. I've taken a year of Spanish, so i wish it had me where i should be, instead of reteaching me the basics, it's very discouraging when you're doing a lesson and run out of hearts. I wish you could save the progress, come back later, and fix your mistakes instead of having to re-do the entire lesson. Otherwise, it's a very useful app ü´∂"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I recommend duolingo to anyone trying to learn a language. It's easy to fit the short exercises into an already busy schedule. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that I wish they would improve the arabic course. I tried out the Spanish course, and it was very extensive and thought through. Sadly, not all language courses are at that level yet. I would recommend the Arabic course to anyone trying to learn the Arabic alphabet and first words. But sadly the course is too short."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Useful app to learn languages in an easy and fun way, esp. good for kids (lots of vocab about animals). But as an adult, the vocab learned is not useful enough (learning how to say that you lost your snake or that you wash your turtle on Sundays is totally useless, for ex). It seriously lacks vocab on traveling, which is why most of us want to learn another language in the 1st place. Another problem is that there is no explanation when you get a question wrong, you just have to try to guess."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Since the app has been updated, there are so many glitches. Keep losing lives because the word choice for the translation cannot be added to the sentence. As it "" sticks"" and feedback does not get acknowledged. And you cannot progress any further... please fix the problem. Update: stopped using it. Totally fed up, playing it for hours to wake up in the morning to find yourself ousted to a different league. Much preferred just working at your own pace."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Started using the app again after almost 10 years and it's still buggy and annoying as ever. I love getting answers wrong because the voices are hard to understand and missing an answer because of a typo. And it's great how you can't save the random 15minute xp boosts for later when it might be more convenient. Literally everytime I use an early bird or night owl chest I get an extra 15 minute xp boost that goes to waste since I don't have 30 minutes.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a good way to begin another language, the gaming, side will appeal to some and links to others help if learning alone or at various times. I'm pleased the Irish language lessons, the listening, the pronunciation, the resouces and the use of two native voices has improved in the last week. This makes it less challenging after a run of 200 days compared with the Spanish, for example."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have downloaded it yesterday an I am enjoying it very much. The interface is very user-friendly, and I love that you can skip hearing and speaking lessons when you're in public. I also enjoy the hearts system, it gives you time to go back and fix mistakes. Overall duolingo is a wonderful app for language lessons. Por favor, ¬°Duolingo! Audios, buenos noches, buenos d√≠as."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I always wanted to learn how to speak in French, but my attention span made learning boring. Duolingo made it fun by making it a game with experience points, achievements, and friends can join me. Merci beaucoup mon Aimee, duo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The random course rewrites are infuriating. I have almost 500 days under my belt and suddenly I am being presented with ""we drink"" and ""ice cream"" as allegedly new words. The practice centre should give me choice about what I want to do. If I'm lucky I get a unit rewind (but no choice in which), otherwise it could just be speaking practice. The course hints and tips seem lighter touch so grammar is harder to tackle head on. In short - an okay app, but look elsewhere for meaningful development"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good but too 'American' with translations. I think they need a British or International English option for translations. For example, I'm learning German and certain words like ""Fu√üball"" literally mean ""football"" - but it's translated as ""soccer"". The US is the only country to call it soccer, everywhere else calls it football. That's one example, but I've noticed quite a few translations that aren't quite right due to Americanisms and it can be confusing, unless you're American."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Frequent crashes; Often not awarding double points when they've been earned; Freezing up after some adverts; No responses when contacted via e-mail; Many poor translations into English that are nothing like an English speaker would say (Special thanks to a lot of Spanish modules); Bad voice recognition software (varies between courses); Not registering lessons when completed... I could go on. But yeah, it's free. I guess that's a positive thing..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"duo is great for learning some phrases, but it doesn't often explain enough why words are different and how they should be changed accordingly to context and situations. different languages have very different rules and don't translate directly. Over time you can learn patterns. It can be helpful if there are linked comments in questions, but it would be much more helpful if there was more explanations There are some good points in the summary but it's not enough to earn a good understanding."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is overall a great app. But there are some inconveniences that makes it less enjoyable. Sometimes progress is not saved in quests and even though I achieve one, it's not counted in the month challenge. And when I get an achievement, leave the app and open the app again, I have to get it again because somehow it didn't save it. I like the new path thing but getting a ton of XP boosters instead of gems is a little annoying, especially when chests only give you 5 gems most of time."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I still really like Duolingo. However I can't give it a full 5 for the following reasons. The Chinese course has many mistakes and incorrect translations in it. The community consistently reports these, but they are never corrected. Some courses don't appear to be activity maintained or supported. I've had an entire section (12 units) of progress disappear. That's months of progress gone. After reporting this problem twice and waiting a could of months, no reply or resolution."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a great introduction to learning a language. However, it is too limited to be a good teacher, so you should seek other sources of learning, whether it's through a paid course, youtube videos, or a library book. But where Duolingo shines is as the perfect tool to practice and retain the language skills you've acquired. Not a good way to practice speaking, though. The voice recognition is pretty terrible."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a fun app that helps you memorize certain words and phrases but doesn't actually help you learn a language. I feel like this app is a good supplement for ""learning a language"" if you took a class in spanish or another language and want to ""brush up on your skills"". Duolingo also doesn't teach you the proper grammar structure of a language, like were to put nouns, pronouns, verbs, and adjectives, or when to use a different spelling of the same word."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is a great app. I think it learns you so well and have so much choices you can choose from. I understand that it has not all the languages and why, but I would like you to add the Albanian course and some other courses of languages that are not very known. You can make free the listen and speaking lessons, but it would still be great even it is not possible."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Hi, it's Duo. Remember how you were two lessons away from completing the section, looking forward to new content? Good news, we have Changed the Course Content, setting you back two or three dozen lessons you now have to redo. It's for your own good! Aren't you excited? Also, we'll be randomly discarding your progress on the lessons you've just completed, making you doubt your sanity. Happy grinding!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Constantly under review, ever changing deeper learning of multiple languages. Duolingo's goals and outlines according to their conventions/panels are very honourable and give me a lot of respect for the company. And it's free! Meaning it's accessible to anyone. I recommend paying for the no ads variant as I have as ads really derail the learning experience. At least, it helped me anyway."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I really dislike the life system in the app. It makes going through the courses more tedious and it feels like I'm wasting my time. Half the time my mistakes come from the vocab match ups, which tend to be misclicks. It makes me burn through my lives fast, which is super annoying. If the goal is to make language learning easy and fun, then remove the feature that ACTIVELY halts progress. All the life system does is make me not want to use the app/website."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have owned the app for almost a decade. The devs consistently have been changing course material that takes away levels and/or completes random legendaries courses. Their solution is either to just try to find where you were or create a new account for a placement test. Also the removal of profile pictures is dumb. I have no clue who my friends are anymore without it. It's an incredibly frustrating time to be a Duolingo user and they keep making things worse with no communication.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it's a great app, I'm loving it since I started using it. it keeps you motivated, by making you earn gifts and spots/positions. that sense of competition is nice. the daily reminders too are great just in case you get busy and forget about learning. I would have loved for me to be able to review my previous courses fully but I only get to see a little of my previous courses, good thing I write them down. A bit of Ad here and there, but all in all I give it 4 stars. it's very beginner friendly‚ù§Ô∏è"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I think it's a great app for learning vocabulary and getting familiar with the structure of a language via repetition. However, having had Super for a year after getting duped into a subscription plan, I notice how many essential features have been locked behind a paywall rather than Duolingo offering compelling features in Super. It's a typical problem with free apps trying to establish a business model."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is good for learning basic amounts of languages. For example, I've been taking German lessons to brush up on my skills. However, Duolingo does not teach you how to conjugate verbs or how articles change in depending on case and grammatical gender. Instead of teaching these things, you have to guess, then invariably will lose hearts because you guessed wrong. My theory is that the app does this to force you to pay for a subscription."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,free fun and the most helpfull. I don't recommend it though to someone who knows absolutely nothing about the language unless you're getting the premium edition wich allows to make unlimited mistakes. I am learning german with it but I did study it for 2 years in high school wich makes it more effective for me because I am remembering what I already know but also adding to it.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm really enjoying the ease and simplicity of this app. it makes me want to practice Italian each day. Also, the lessons are super fun and match my goals for learning the language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Things are pretty good for the moment but there are some issues that usually arise when an update rolls around. It usually gets fixed after a couple weeks but that can be annoying. All in all I am learning alot in Spanish but when I go to other languages it is too tough for me to understand without any basic understanding of letters/characters and sentence structure. Maybe one day I'll try to figure them out but for now I love learning spanish.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good app. Learning through repetition mainly. I would like to see way more grammar. And it's really focused on money making which is a shame. Even for the people who pay for the lessons and the app there is a push to buy more xp, especially when doing matching madness or other similar tasks. Even if you know the answers and you are fluent and quick, it is impossible to complete the task in the time allocated. You will be forced to pay more for extra time boost, which is a shame."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I started using this app in January this year. It had been really good and I had no issues until this latest update. 1. Started pushing me to do courses already done months ago. 2. Wouldn't allow me to do challenges 3. 3 days ago wouldn't open at all. I restarted my phone and it opened but when I completed a course it froze and the next day didn't acknowledge I had completed the course. Day after it wouldn't open. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling and it deleted my profile. 221 streak gone.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is useful for learning vocabulary. However, since the focus is translation with little specific instruction, its usefulness is limited if your goal is to learn to communicate in a variety of situations. If you want to learn a language for a specific purpose such as for travel, it's frustrating since useful phrases are not presented in the first several units."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I DO NOT like the updated version! I was forced to upgrade. the new version is very childish, with cartoons that I can't disable. the old version gave you am option to disable those. also, the old version allowed me to choose a profile photo whereas this one forces a cartoon avatar. the worst part is that it changed where I was in my learning process, changed the questions, the levels, and the setup is totally different. I'm not so sure that I will continue using this app anymore."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like a lot of things about Duo, but the new achievements don't tell you what you're aiming for or how close you are. When you finish a course you can't target specific areas for revision, the daily refresh is a bit random and gets very repetitive. In my course there are also missing translations, and still no instructions on grammar in the section books, just a list of example phrases. Good for a free app but since paying for a year of Super I'm disappointed."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Really interactive app for learning. It has a widget for the home screen that is super cute and help you remember to do your daily lesson. You can learn multiple language, you can switch super fast. the lesson are good, they make you write, speak, answer questions, complete sentences. It has a lot of variety. and the lectures are really fun!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really like how the app is designed. I do miss the old layout from a couple of years ago but I do feel like Duo is giving me a hint to learn faster, also it stops me from exclusively focusing on the story lessons. I have never had any problems with the app and it has never glitched or crashed. It is user friendly and I do feel more comfortable with French!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The learning program is divided into levels which in turn are divided into steps. The step length bloated 2-3 times at a certain point which i dislike. I would prefer shorter sessions with more steps. Some of the sentences are divided into small parts while translating (for example o' and clock are to this point always separate) i would prefer otherwise. Some of the sentence structures and enunciation sound weird but with a material library of so many languages it's most likely bound to happen.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"In short: the app used to be better on both PC and mobile, the learning format gets tiring after some time, there are better alternatives to learning languages (online courses, studying grammar, using Anki, conversing with natives, etc.), Super Duolingo is definitely not worth your money, but the app overall still has some effectiveness with the younger audience."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Update: From 4 to 3 stars, simply because it is no longer interesting to me - when ya'll streamlined so I could no longer jump around for topics I lost interest. There's issues about teaching too, notably in the Japanese. I would never use Duolingo to actually learn a language from the beginning. It's fun as a supplement and game though, and better than nothing."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall, engaging and good for learning vocab and INTRO to verb tenses with spaced repetition games. Falls short in grammar explanations, sentences often group words/ideas that aren't useful in everyday conversation, and automated voices often rush through conjunctions like ""but"" and ""and"" ... which can make it extra difficult to follow, since FRE language already runs lots of words together (liaison)."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Not the best tool - in a unit (hundreds of exercises) you often only learn ten nouns while some multiple whole units will be refreshers of something previous (I.e Spanish object pronouns). Sometimes you just correct the parts of the sentence you missed but many more times you will have to type out the whole sentence again (even for minor typos). It is hard to test ahead and you lose progress when the course is updated. Offline mode and discussions seem eliminated entirely now
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Although you'll probably want to learn grammar separately, this app is great for learning and is very methodical in how new vocab / phrases are introduced. The gamification keeps you wanting to come back and study more. Minus one star for the intrusiveness of the adverts (not an issue on the free browser version), although I appreciate the ability to earn back hearts to keep learning. Overall, a very well designed system."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Half of my CORRECT answers won't get accepted, there's constantly audio and lag issues, sometimes ads will pop up after a lesson which is normal but if the ad is for some unknown reason interrupted because the app is always jumping around, it'll give you a Grey screen that won't go away unless you close the app and lose your reward. This app takes too much money to constantly fix things that aren't even broken or need tampering instead of fixing actual problems."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Excellent app ! I love that you can absolutely learn without paying, you get the same quality out of the app either way. In my opinion, the only thing missing is a lexicon of all the words you have learnt, instead of key phrases that can't encompass everything. In addition, I would love to have more grammar concepts explained within the app, but maybe it's specific to my Norwegian course and there are more for other languages."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This review is for Chinese. I paid for the full version. It is a decent intro to learning Chinese. It's more gamified than other apps, which I like. Feedback: Some common sounds like Âá† don't have recordings. I wish I could see the pinyin pronunciation tips after the first time. I wish the list of pinyin sounds included all 5 tones, instead of only 1 of the 5 tones. I wish there were examples of tone pairs, or a tone pair game. I wish I could go back and practice old Chinese characters."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It keeps crashing since the new update. At least a few times a day. Reinstalling does nothing. I'm not sure what's going on but a lot of people seem upset about the new updates. Not sure if subscribing for another year is worth it at this point... I miss the old Duolingo:( Edit: it's been a month and it has stopped crashing but now it just freezes randomly and I have to restart. It happens about twice a day. RIP
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"started to learn four languages, it's actually insane how easy this app is to use and stuff, other than the occasional ads, it's an absolutely great app!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Points and double XP don't always add up correctly. It rewards you by saying you'll earn more the next 15 minutes and then doesn't always activate. I'm still learning the language. The concept, delivery and ability to keep progressing well on through the lessons for free is amazing! The handful of oops and glitches are worth it. The price of the plans are too expensive for me personally. Thanks for the alternate opportunity to learn with all the advertisements. Hopefully they contribute well."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's a fun way to learn that motivates you with challenges. You learn by listening and repetition with occasional visual association. Grammar isn't really covered you just have to hope you pick it up which is my biggest gripe with it. The speed of learning is all over the place at least it was for me trying to learn Japanese. The language used is also not entirely correct for Japan and the levels of formality are not explained.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used to really love this app, as it was so easy to use and actually made learning new languages fun. However, after all the ""improvements"" they've made, it's become more of a race to finish as many lessons as quickly as possible in order to stay in the leaderboards, which means you're learning even less than before. It's become more of an annoying game, all for the purposes of charging us money to make decent headway."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Just finished the entire Japanese course after close to 2 years. Pros: It's free! Repetition is king for language learning and Duo excels. You will gain an extensive library of vocabulary for the language of your choice. Cons: Memorising sentences without context does not help you learn a language. The comment section was really helpful for me regarding said lack of context but removal of comment section really puts the nail in the coffin. Thank you Duo, for the good times and the bad."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I am learning Korean, and this app is a great tool for me. Sadly, the lessons do not gradually teach you properly. We go from learning a couple new words, then into full sentences without learning the structure of the sentence (Korea uses Subject, object, verb as sentence structure), and how certain words change depending on the topic. Please ease new users in, or they might get discouraged."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"after two years of daily practice I have learned some Italian. I'm disappointed in the new format...they just added 20 or so levels and they all seem to be repeated and recycled questions - there's no opportunity for discussion (the forum has disappeared) to find out why something is the correct answer. it's basically my way or the hiway learning, don't ask questions. I have one particular area I struggle with and now I can't go back and re do that section. Do better new duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've used duo for years, I have a 1000+ day streak at the time of writing this. Duolingo used to be great but so much has been removed over the last 12 months like tests, actual lessons in the guides, and the ability to discuss questions, that I don't think I'd recommend it to newcomers any more. Add to that the 'max' subscription is now required to understand what you're doing wrong and really this is only for 'restaurant' level language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"well structured app. It is constructed to get wrong to get improve. At first, I was afraid to make mistakes then I realise this app is supporting me to learn things by making mistakes. Yet making mistakes, it is the key to learn. They encourage you a lot. Obviously they researched a lot to develop the app. One thing to point out is that this app is certainly for English speakers or at least bilingual with English."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been studying Russian with DL for 3 years. It gets worse with each update! It's not much good after you get beyond the beginner level, having a limited number of topics covered. Errors are frequent and are rarely corrected. It's ok for beginnners and does inculcate a habit of daily practice but because of its limitations, I will probably stop using it soon.I tried Super DL for a free week (they are endlessly plugging this paid-for version) but apart from having no ads, is just not worth it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's good in some ways and sucks in others. The structure is nice but they change it after every update, and when it does it sets you back 2 or 3 units (for reference theres 8 units in section 1). I was SO PROUD of myself for finally making it to section 2, and now I'm back to unit 7 in section 1 after the update. It's really discouraging and makes me want to quit. So now I kinda wanna find a new app. After doing this for 222 days straight, I learned a lot, but feel like I've gotten nowhere."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Buggy mess and horrible for German. Firstly, bugs are constant - either automatically failing the exercise without pressing anything or the exercise is complete for you, or the app freezes and you can't do anything and have to reset. Of course, you lose a heart in the process. Secondly, German words have a definite article (der, die, das). But Duolingo doesn't care about those when teaching you words, however, you get quizzed on them?! No explanation of grammar, just dumb phrases. It's a mess!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Would have rated higher, but honestly, the whole leaderboard thing is a real turn off, I want to learn without being told I need to try harder to out rank someone. It adds a lot of pressure to try and learn a new language when that's already a process in itself. The notification attached to the leaderboard is also frustrating. Would definitely enjoy the ability to turn it off."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like the stories. They are quick and help learn how conversations will go. As for the actual lessons, they don't really explain anything and will very often mark you wrong even if you are correct. Spelling counts. So if you are doing a listening exercise that you have to type and you misspell a word, you are marked wrong. It's just not my way of learning"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A very good app! ¬°Me encanta! also I'm glad they added early access to music and math, the only problem is that on Mac book, pressing enter on both math and music won't go to the next question, because at language course you go to the next question by pressing enter, so fix that! also at music make so you can tap the notes with the keyboard (macbook), because it's hard to hover with the mouse on the notes. But it's early access, so I was expecting bugs! I hope you got useful info! Bye& do great!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It was incredible, until several months ago when they ""updated it"" now I find it harder to learn, I preferred having separate catagories to go back to and practice because I need a lot of repetition and I keep getting new words every question. Please revert back. Or have different layouts for different learning styles/levels. Also I just had to spend 500 gems to revive my streak even though I practiced earlier today and for some reason it didn't count. Not the first time that's happened either."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Motivates me to keep going, which counts for a lot in language learning. I guess my wish is the ability to choose a bit more what I'm learning to say. For example, being able to describe objects in the kitchen would be really practical, compared to first learning how to ask where the hospital is. Then again, I know it's probably coming as a lesson in the future, and I get that they need to build on each lesson in some sort of systematic way. So maybe I'm just impatient, lol. . Also, affordable!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I find Duolingo easy to use and the beneficial. The ads aren't too frequent, and the teaching method is effective. it uses repetition and brings back the things that you made mistakes on. I don't find this app moving forward quickly enough or with enough options to review questions I have. but it really has increased my confidence in the ability to understand and speak in my coming trip to Spain."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,duo lingo is the best platform to learn Languages through games. But the problem is that when it comes an exercise to speak something it does not allow me. That's the reason I gave it a 4 star rating. I think that you should also choose this app instead of tuitions and clases . It is even totally free. You get streaks to maintain your goals. You can even fight for leages. Thank-you üòáüòäüôè
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I am a Duolingo plus subscriber and I very dissatisfied. The lessons are great but customer support is non-existent. My status has recently been demoted due to experience that is slowly tallied. I am not able to use all of the ""perks"" of the plus membership and have been erroneously charged as a result. My disappointment grew when I realized that Duolingo is only available on my phone. The website and Windows app are YEARS out of date and aren't really compatible with each other."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Lacks overall use in the real world. The app was much better when I first signed up a few years ago. Now it's just learning sentences that you would never use and having SO MUCH of the entire app focused on reading and just having to pick all the right words, spelled correctly, out of a list isn't helping me to speak the language AT ALL! I ook German in high school and still remember more from that than Duolingo. I switched to Spanish to see if my prior knowledge was the issue, but it's not."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! I'm technically learning 5 different languages right now,and I'm able to form coherent sentences in 3 of them. the convenience of having duolingo on my phone makes it super easy to keep a streak. consistency is the best way to build any skill and I feel that duolingo does a great job at encouraging consistency. it doesn't matter if you do 1 lesson, or finish 3. they also bring your friends (if you have any) into the equation and you can congratulate them as they complete quests."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I can't get over the Match Madness game. It's impossible to do and I get tasked with it every day. I already have Super. I'm here to learn and be motivated, and I like the pre determined quests giving me a goal to focus on, but I'm tired of getting impossible tasks to every day. Its demotivating and I just don't end up practicing every day anymore. This feature feels like it's designed for me to fail."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's great when you first start a new language and are learning the basics. But as you progress the app does not teach language well at all. Sometimes the tiniest typos cause you to get the answer wrong and that is very frustrating. The price of the paid version is laughably expensive. Also, when you are working on a phone it is incredibly annoying when you have to retype the entire answer when all you did was make one small typo on your first attempt. Bad experience for user."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The lessons are engaging, but the app itself is unstable. It crashes whenever you tab into another app while it's open. It crashes loading into and out of ads. It crashes even if you get a notification for another app while using it. Just now I paid 100 gems to attempt the legendary mode for a lesson, but someone messaged me and the notification popup crashed duolingo. when i quit out of the app and restarted, the lesson was gone and i had to forfeit another 100 gems to complete it!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a great language learning app. I am learning Spanish and Japanese on it and it's definitely an amazing way to learn. The cool features make it fun and easy to learn. However sometimes the app does crash and glitch making it really annoying and it takes a really long time for the app itself to open. I don't like the update that changes the match madness feature to 30 gems . Would appreciate it to be 10 once again. But Despite , will definitely recommend this app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Much better for learning a language than taking classes. A few problems: when an incorrect answer is given they should EXPLAIN WHY the answer is wrong. When an answer is correct it would help if they showed alternative correct answers to help further student understanding. I hate the leaderboard & wish I could opt out of the competition. I only like to compete with myself. Being forced into the competition feels like being punished for trying to study every day. List of learned vocab would nice
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Overall, it's ok. But I'm kinda getting sick of getting dings for wrong grammar when it never explains how grammar in a language works in practice. I also don't like that it doesn't explain multi-meanings/colloquialisms. For example, in the Norwegian lessons ""na og da"" is translated as ""sometimes."" This is technically wrong. That really translates to ""now and then."" Not using direct translation whenever available and/or using colloquialisms like this is incredibly confusing for casual learners."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have been using Duo for several years now. It is a pretty solid learning tool held back by a constantly shifting interface and lesson layout that is seemingly designed to keep users annoyed more than anything. Even meeting, and exceeding, every learning goal often puts you thousands of points, sometimes tens of thousands, behind others in the league which seems suspicious."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this for over a year and in general used to really enjoy it. The leagues, daily quests and monthly badges always encouraged me to do a little bit more than I otherwise would. However recently it seems to really have gone crazy with all of the above, setting targets that I just can't realistically reach and increase each month! And so it has become very demotivating. Please just go back to normal, reasonable, daily quests and monthly badges..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It keeps glitching out and not giving the rewards that you've earned for quests. It happens about every third day and it's getting kind of annoying. Thought the last update might have helped but nope. Still a fun way of learning but the free version is becoming more and more of a challenge to use. I know it's free and I'm fine with limited features but maybe fix it and don't keep stripping stuff away?
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The update has decided for me what level I should now be on. The issue with that is, it assumes I know everything prior to the level it assigned me despite the update completely changing many sections and the stuff learned in those sections. Now, I find myself on unit 8, whereas I don't know some stuff in unit 7 or prior. Words I ""should"" already know, according to the app, in reality I've not seen before. The worst part is, I can't go back and relearn a section. All I can do is ""practice"" it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have used the app for about 2 years now. I have enjoyed it and learned a lot. Lately it has been messing up. For example after the lesson it keeps trying to load and will stay in that screen without actually loading. Once I close the app and restart it, the lesson will be completed but rewarded points are not updated. I opened it for the first time today and 2 of the 3 quests were completed and it didn't show I had gained any quest rewards. I hadn't even played yet for the day. :("
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is pretty good for direct learning of common sentences used on a daily basis. But, it doesn't teach the learner in a ""school"" way, such as teaching grammar first as to know how to start structuring sentences when communicating in other general scenarios. I'm referring to the various grammatical subjects and verbs, and the different tenses. It's more of a ""guided teaching/study"" rather than ""an overall learning"" platform. Considering its being free of cost, it's quite good."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I wish I wasn't put into the weekly leaderboards with people who are ""super"" users. I think it's unfair because I want to learn for free, so I try not to advance my learning, just so I can keep up with the points. Also I hate the constant ""super"" advertisements, they're long and again, I don't want it. I also hate it when Duolingo forces you to try their ""super"" program. It takes away from my own learning. I also didn't like the format they changed to: ""the path way."" The older one was better."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Came back after a while, this ‚ù§ system is not the vision you guys promised, it totally forces you to use super. Thanks for ruining the best language app out there. I can see more sneaky monitization coming. Update: it somehow managed to get even worse. Now it has a linear path with an algorithm that somehow forgets you learned words given in the first lesson. Update: Now after every lesson getting an advert for Duolingo Super, telling me I should buy it so that they will stop the interruptions."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It's like they're trying to mess up with the app after each update. There is no way to contact them to make a direct suggestion. Also the new method it's just really slow with repetition and no progress. It was better before when they focused on theaching and not on billing or asking for money. It's just sad seeing a really great app degradating.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo used to be great and I could work my way through a course enjoying it, but there now seems to be endless drives to keep updating the app, each update bringing needless changes to layout and content. Useful features are frequently removed and there's no choice anymore over what you learn and when. It's incredibly repetitive and slow to progress, no grammar explanations in the app, final straw was them removing the discussion feature. Revert the changes and I would happily rate it higher"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Personally I think that this app isn't too bad, it doesn't teach all the essentials, but if your taking a language class for smth like high school or college credits, this app is really good for reviewing content and materials, and gives you that dopamine boost of saving your streak. I can't say this for everyone, but this app has helped me prepare for Chinese exams during school, and has helped me remember certain characters more so then school did like the character Âçä as in ‰∫îÈªûÂçä(5:30)."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"learning Spanish for ~ a year. Drills, spiral style of teaching vocabulary and repetition r used, which is fine. It works on the 4 linguistic skills, great. Some stories and exercises are fun. However, they shove too much liberal propaganda in our faces. such as homosexuity and forced inclusivity. Just like Netflix does. So my inconvenience is regarding political agenda of the app rather than technical. Kids use this app, some societies aren't ready for these social ideas the app is promoting"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Nice to learn languages like a game! üòä It's fair that one can choose between the free version with ads and a paid subscription. Please show in the app how much the subscription costs, I couldn't find that in the app. ‚ÑπÔ∏è Please also bring back the nice animations to reward for 5 or 10 correct answers in a row. The small stories were much nicer than a hectic Duo flying in and out so quickly. People in a hurry can simply switch it off üôèü¶â"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I have been doing duolingo for about 3 years and know more Spanish than I did but find it expensive to subscribe so just use the free version but find that there are issues with the help feature constantly giving the wrong help and their explanations on how to use certain verbs are useless. I guess for a free service you can't expect perfection. on the whole I enjoy learning but it is frustrating with the help feature not being very helpful. super is much better but I don't have the budget
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's a nice application to create an habit (I will have a 1000 day streak very soon now). But I downgraded my rate to 4 stars because the loading time to load a lesson is a lot longer than before (It was around 3 to 5 seconds last year but now it's around 15 to 30 seconds now). And the new text to speech feature doesn't work very well on the japanese lesson. It often adds small spaces in the sentence that are marked as wrong even though all the other characters are right.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Using it for learning Spanish and the app is all over the place. Drills words like ""have"" and ""want"" (words i already knew) but hasn't touched other verbs like take, etc. Is uber repetitive with some words then suddenly introduces others without explaining their meaning and now you're losing hearts. Shows words mean one thing when you click them but tells you you're wrong when you pick or enter what it's showing you. Good thing it's free and not making a good case to purchase the paid version."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"First of all this app didn't alert me to when the super trial period ended. It said it would( my alerts were on and I received reminders daily about my streak). When they charge, it's for THE YEAR at once even though they advertise the monthly cost in bigger font. So if you think you're going to pay $6.99 a month when the period is over you are mistaken. Its in a lump sum. The free part of it is still functional but nowhere near as good . The heart system refills too slowly."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Problem is, any mistakes you make, you can't practice again without paying. Worse yet, you'll often make a mistake and not be able to understand why. Add on lessons that just repeat the same thing over and over and the whole thing becomes an exercise in tedium. Somehow, this update has made Duolingo worse to use, it now forces you down a path of constant repetition and the stories are rare and worse."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is good, but definitely needs some improvements. My biggest gripes are the voices and the lack of explanation of mistakes. The voices (for French) are sometimes difficult to understand. For speaking French, I'm sure it's authentic. For learning French, it's a pain. If you can't understand the professor, you don't learn. Need notes on WHY I missed something. ""De"", ""des"", ""de la"", ""du"", etc. are not easy, and I would love to know the rules when I make (yet another) mistake."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app isn't worth it at the moment. Especially if you are considering buying a premium subscription. My friends on iOS get different feature set than I do on Android. Like they can see my progress on a course, I cannot. They even get more courses to choose from. Like iOS got Math and Music courses, Android doesn't include those. If you think they will include all of that in the next release, you are going to be wrong. I've been on the app for a year, they don't add features for Android users."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Pretty good with the language teaching, not so great with rewards. If you're competing with friends weekly, like mine and my friends do, it's kinda a waste of time. Often, when you send an XP boost, the other person doesn't receive it and vice versa. If you finish a lesson section, you also get a boost, but the app also coincidentally shuts down, and the boost is gone. Also, the games you play don't give the XP that they advertise. It says 75 xp, but you actually only get 60."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new course design is horrible (several months old at this point). There's no choice involved, you're forced to do the same level for days in a row. The same sentences repeat for several levels on end, so unless you're super excited about drilling those over and over in the same day, it could take you a week to get through a level. Then it's the same sentences again! Nothing new actually comes in. (I'm in Section 3 currently)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Feeling pretty fluent after 3 weeks of consistent practice! The pace is perfect, and lends itself to effortless consistency! A massive thank you to everyone involved in bringing this to life! Edit: Dropping to a 3 star because of the update to the achievement system. You can no longer see progress towards the end of an achievement, and the removal of the finished gold plaque makes it seem like nothing is even happening."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm really starting to enjoy this app, but I have 2 issues: 1.) Whenever I reach the final lesson of the part before a chest, my app always crashes and glitches a lot. 2.) I really need heart, having a mistake helps me to learn, but losing hearts easily is making me only use the app for about 5 mins max :( at least change it so you get one every 20 minutes or something rather than 4 hours x"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Really good, but seems you will need to make in game purchases to beat some timed exercises even with the purchased version. timed exercises are optional but Important to me in order to get the full experience. some seem Impossible to beat without spending gems on increased time. seems sleazy to force these microtransactions onto paying customers. shame on you. Also, I probably would have bought for $10 per month, but will not buy for $120 up front."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Mostly I enjoy Duolingo. I've been paying for the Super version almost 3 years now. Lately I have noticed a bug in the Android version where it causes me to use a Streak Freeze even if I practiced some days. It seems like it might have some correlation with reminder notifications. I'm so close to 1000 days. I'll be disappointed if I don't make it.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I tried Duolingo years ago and I couldn't get into it. I got some decent streaks, but nothing felt right. I came back to try again, and I can say with certainty that some more time for the app to develop was what my language journey needed. Everything feels improved from the UI to the courses themselves. The duolingo team should feel proud in making language so fun and accessible, and striving to make their app better!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Simple error on their side, very misleading, and causes me to quit this before I really start. It's set up like a game, and you "" lose hearts"" when you are incorrect. There is one phrase I correctly selected three times, though it was saying it was incorrect ""I am Paul"". (French) I screenschotted this for proof. I understand this is a free app, but how can I trust it's going to teach me the correct language with issues so early on in the process?? Do Better. Was hopeful, now discouraged."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is a useful learning tool with some irritating quirks. 3 things that are great: the podcast; the integrated listening exercises; and the flexibility that comes from the brevity of lessons. 3 things that suck more than they should: the intrusive/manipulative notifications from Lily; the monotony of exercises; and the pace of learning.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Pretty good but I was hoping to be able to start at a more advanced level to practice kanji. The opening test didn't really seem to help with that as it put me right into beginner phrases and I'm locked to hiragana only. I think this is great for someone who is fresh to a new language. I might try it out with Mandarin or Russian for fun sometime.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"overall, it's a good language app and I use it daily. There are frustrating glitches: 1, After completing a round,the app often freezes. 2, during speed rounds screen taps often don't get recorded, and that prevents users from completing levels. It's frustrating. The app then encourages users to buy time credits to pass the level. It sure seems to be purposefully built bug to drive sales - and that feels gross. üòï 3, it says English comes from the USA Bugs reported, no response from Duo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Isn't bad at all however the speaking sections are a real struggle, they never pick up me correctly and just speaking literal gibberish trying to mimic key sound points like just a k sound for the word ""like"" will accept it, but If I try and say like with a not pronounced k sound it will never pick up the word. Otherwise all other exercises are great, weird grammar at times, it's not wrong but it's only not wrong on technicalities."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Every iteration of duo gets worse. After the big changes which changed from a learning app to a game, every update makes you have to buy timers, accidentally due to the buy buttons while typing or deliberately just to get game points. The help is gone. The forums are gone. The AI they seem to be using is more like a tease to make you make mistakes so you have to buy timers. Without ""super"" it's nearly impossible to practice. So sad."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I do not like that my XP boost cannot be paused. Those are hard to come by, and sometimes I need to pause my lesson but the xp boost keeps ticking... Also, if I get another XP boost while I have one, the newer does nothing. I would expect that to be stored, or if not, the current timer extended. Or at least reset to 15 minutes. But nope. It simply goes ignored. I was considering getting a subscription, but with such issues, I cannot pay with a good heart."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"While it gives a decent introduction to the available languages, some courses like Arabic are short and only provide a bare foundation. The app lacks a text box for writing the letters of non-Latin alphabets, meaning you have no ability to check how they look as part of full words, nor does it have a dedicated translation feature. The app also doesn't provide a built-in dictionary feature or resources for learning grammar. The free version is completely worth it, but the paid version is not."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm pretty sure I'm learning with it. The return to practicing what you learnt a few days ago seems about right. A few things I find a bit irritating: Sometimes the English is a paraphrase of the German, yet if you provide your own paraphrase or have variant word order it's marked as wrong. It's in American English (I suppose as its an American app that's to be expected). In order to encourage you to pay, you can only make 5 mistakes. You usually must wait until next day to continue."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Good, but has room for improvement. It is quite quick to take a 'heart' from you if you get two words in the wrong order or miss one letter from a spelling, I think you should be given another chance to get that right first. Some sentences are quite odd and not something that you would naturally say. However, good app for free version. Should have the option of not competing in a league, I don't see the benefit of that."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Subscribed to the Super Duo free trial. 2 days prior to the end of the free trial, they are supposed to notify you so that you would confirm a paid Super Duo subscription at the end of the trial. I was not notified, and my account was upgraded to a paid account. I am giving 1 star due to the shady sales tactics and lack of notification. I live a busy life, and since it explicitly stated that a notification would be provided, and therefore, I was relying on it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app freezes often after I complete a lesson and I lose all the progress made. The app freezes during the timed exercises while the clock ticks down and I lose all the points accumulated. The app is slow transitioning from screen to screen. I don't like the competitive part of it. I don't want to be on a leaderboard, I want to learn a language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is an okay app, but it's more like I've memorised the answer than actually learning a language. And throws new words at me and expects me to get them correct. If I wasn't learning Spanish at school, then I think I would find it trickier than what I actually do because obviously, I know the basics. Also, there isn't as much practice of writing as I would have liked, but other than that, it's very good for learning the basics of a language and would recommend it!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The paid version is much better than the unpaid version, but it used to be very good unpaid. They made some changes which is expected. The lessons are decent, some of the exercises are very easy especially when they give you the words to choose from. One thing I wish was different is the 15 minutes of x2 XP. I always seem to get this award when I'm getting off the app, so I don't get to use the x2 XP. I would prefer this to be something that I can store for later use."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Duo for years now, and I've definitely become more fluent in the languages I study. I really appreciate what they've put together. However, I'm not a fan of the recent updates with the Legendary. Sharing the hearts with the regular+lessons really limits my chances to study each day. At least I can understand that one. What bothers me the most is how redundant and repetitive so many Legendary lessons are. They repeat over and over to a point I'm not reviewing or learning anything."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have had an account for over 8 years, and the last few updates have made this app less usable and less helpful. The audio does not pick up at times even when you're in a quiet room, there is no explanation for why stuff is wrong sometimes. The animations they added to show progress on daily quests are just drawn out for unknown reasons. But lucky for all of us, rather than addressing these issues, they just added an avatar creator feature that is just so weird and also feels unnecessary."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the challenges and the leagues. It motivates me even more! The lessons are fun and thorough. Some seem repetitive, but they say repetition is the mother of skill. I also noticed a few errors since I'm a Spanish teacher. That's my only complaint. And there is a way to flag errors, which is great. My kids enjoy doing the lessons too, so we may have to get the family account."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"While this app is great at getting you to consistently practice learning another language, I've had some problems with it while learning Japanese. A few examples include: no dedicated kanji practice, getting marked wrong if you use a kanji the app isn't familiar with (even if it's correct), and no dedicated speaking practice like some other languages have. I've submitted feedback regarding these issues within the app, but haven't seen or heard of any changes so far. Update: problems not solved"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to learn so much from this app and now after all the updates and ""improvements "" I learn nothing. I've supposedly completed all the levels and am now being expected to review verb tenses and words I haven't learned yet! I'm confused and frustrated and it will ""pass"" me now even though I have no idea what I'm doing. The old version forced you to really solidify the material before moving on. The new version is like, ""sure, so what if you got 57 things wrong, let's move on!"""
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's really useful to learn a new language. With duolingo it never feels like learning, it has an excellent gamified course plan and that too according to the CEFR levels! Some minor bug fixes needs to be done though. I used to like the older look more in achievement section with the details of my progress(eg, how many words left to reach 1000) to achieve those targets."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The best free language learning app by far. (Trust me, I've tried them all üò≠.) It's great for beginners, as it teaches you reading, writing, speaking, and listening. It has enough repetition to learn words without being boring, and I find lessons very useful with my learning style. This is the app that schools use, so it's teacher approved. Would recommend."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app if you want to spend a lot of time experiencing gamification and watch ads (or pay for the sub), and maybe learn a word or two occasionally; for language learning‚Äînot so much, not anymore. Gone are useful language tips (they are still preserved by the community on duome, but there's no benefit of integration anymore), gone are forums with meaningful discussions and sentence explanations, gone are interesting stories, gone are structured courses with meaningful language topics."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It used to be so much better! There were grammar explanations for each unit, which have now been gone for a while. The only useful thing left was the sentence discussions (even just on read-only mode). Now it's impossible to understand why you got something wrong and nothing is explained. It makes it extremely difficult to keep advancing even at intermediate level this way. Please fix it and do better! I used to love my daily Duolingo fix and even got premium. Now I'm oking at other apps"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm heartbroken. I got into it in April this year and loved the improvements so much that I bought Super for a year. But now they removed sentence discussions altogether, supposedly to lock it behind another, more expensive subscription. And the speaking function hasn't worked in weeks either (I have updated the app twice since this problem started). I have a 200+ day streak and already paid for the year, but can't see myself continue with Duolingo due to this, all motivation is gone :'("
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"An easy and interactive app. Designed for ease of learning through the use of games, stories, listening, speaking, and multiple choice, amongst others. Streaks to keep you on track and motivate you to continue, challenges and competitions to promote further practice. An incredible range if languages to choose from. Highly recommend."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I was a 5 star review until you took away the sentence discussions in the lessons. I used to learn so much from other people! Since Duolingo offers very little in the way of grammar or explanations, that was where I went when I didn't understand why a word or sentence structure was used. I also liked being able to see Duolingo's ""official"" answer, and what some other options were. This is a BIG miss for me and I can't see renewing my subscription. Please bring it back!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The snake like formatting is absolutely atrocious for courses with lots and lots of units. I use(d) Duolingo for grammar practice and vocab so I can always skip to the newest levels. It's horrible to scroll so much to get to an interesting topic I want to practice. I'm seriously expected to scroll for a literal minute? The organization and ease of accessing early lessons NEEDS to be improved. Also they removed discussion tabs one of the best parts about the app compared to their competitors....
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I find Duolingo very useful because it's pretty much what it says that it does. It's fun, functional and your language skills become better. The only thing that is when your in higher levels in Duolingo, sentences aren't really that common if you know what I mean. Mostly in higher levels it should be changed. Other than that I haven't faced any errors or anything. I would definitely recommend this app if you want to learn new languages. Its very good for beginners."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app. Sometimes it gets bogged down in repetition (you can skip to the next unit but can't skip individual lessons, so you end up reviewing something six times just to review the thing you want once). But a good way to learn vocab and train your ear by hearing it spoken. Haven't tried any other language services so can't compare but this certainly beats trying to learn just from a book."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It does teach quite a bit about whatever language you're learning but it misses the mark on some fundamentals I feel. For instance I'm at a 200+ day streak and still can't count to ten in either of the two languages I've been working on. I think it would benefit from a more flashcard style mechanic for a practice mode or straight up flashcard mode. If you're trying to master a language and have something else for conversational practice it's fine. I'm probably gonna ""go fish"" for another system."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Pls bring back forums!! Sentences have a lot of nuance and grammar that is not taught or mentioned by duolingo. A lot of it is left up to you to decipher and forums were super convenient and helpful, even if it was just finding that one person who explained it a way that made sense to you. Forums was one of the greatest features on duolingo. Pls also bring back the cascading lessons. Having to complete just one is super annoying and I miss the freedom and grouping before the update."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is ok. It has some great features and offers many languages. I'm taking Japanese and although I have learned some from Duolingo, it's hard. The pronunciation isn't always the best and some of the sentences used to help you learn are crazy. Like the question, ""Is that a 4 year old college student?"" When would anyone ever ask that? I also keep losing the desire to play because I keep missing the cut off and my streak is reset. It's very discouraging. Could be useful as a tool though"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"When I finish a class (5 exercises), the app just hangs and would bot respond for like up to 10 mins, I didn't try longer. I have to restart the app, and I am not sure if I get any because after I restart, there are no notifications, no chest opening, nothing. Secondly, if I finish two day challenges at once, then I get only one credited. And finally, there is no any information anywhere what I earn for what, how it all works. Had to use it for 2 weeks to figure it out, interface is confusing."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I was really really enjoying Duolingo and I was learning so much even buying the monthly subscription. But, Monday when the weekly league challenge ended the app shuts itself off and will not go past screen showing 1st 2nd and 3rd place. It freezes and crashes. I have tried uninstalling, clearing the cache... Etc. I don't know what else to do. I really did love this app. It's sad that this has happened."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Good to learn on the go but doesn't focus much on grammar and should provide more verb tables for the different endings as these are difficult to memorise. There is a noticeable bug which I find incredibly annoying - when not connected to WIFI the listening recordings are often blank or only give a partial word when pressed. This leads to you having to guess the word and the loss of lives if you can't work it out through the process of elimination with the other tiles.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is repetitive & obnoxious! A lesson will cover how to say 1-3 things & just repeats the same questions, changing the sentences around. I don't feel like I'm learning enough or quickly. The streak was motivating but annoying. I was giving it a solid chance with an 86 day streak...until yesterday. My mom has a heart attack, I am too busy at the hospital to worry about this, miss 2 days for an emergency & I am back at day 1. I also used two freezes. Should be an exception. I am uninstalling"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good: I have learned many words and can understand a lot of what people say to me. I can also read pretty much everything I need to. Bad: there isn't actually any instruction. You learn by failing over and over with the same concepts because the app doesn't have any information to refer back to. Worse still, there used to be discussion boards/comments that actually contained tips and information for learning the language, but Duo took that away. Shame on you, Duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been using the Duolingo app for the past 45 days to learn Deutsch (German). I believe that if you want to expand your vocabulary, Duolingo is an excellent option. You can learn words in context, and you don't have to worry about word repetition. The app revisits the same words over time while introducing new ones, making it easy to acquire new vocabulary without much effort."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Personally, the best app to learn foreign language. Very easy, very basic methods, makes for a very beginner friendly experience. That said, it does not provide a very detailed look into the language's grammar and such, so it is in one's interest to have some knowledge of it from whatever sources available prior to using Duolingo just to get an idea of what they are learning. Otherwise, like I just said, very good, very beginner friendly, good start to actually mastering new languages."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"One of the 3 apps I've been using for a few years to learn basic Japanese. It's pretty good, though some inconsistencies in what is accepted (eg some UK English not accepted). Knocking off 1 star due to a new bug where completing a chapter brings up a screen saying ""High Scorer, 50 points"" that is not dismissable, no buttons to continue or anything - have to kill the task to exit."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is well made. Learning is kept easy and motivating. It's amazing that one can use it for free. Thank you very much üíê! Edit, which cost you praise for lack of space: I have mentioned inside the app the horrible quality of the Romanian audio. It's teaching incorrect language!?! Then what am I doing here? I get zero feedback! You don't care?Every month without feedback a star goes off..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I decided to give the new ""path"" format a chance. It's been several months now and I confirm that I am learning a lot less efficiently than I was before. This path is terrible for learning Japanese, which is a difficult language. I was doing much better when I could go at my own pace. It is also incredibly frustrating that we cannot see our vocabulary list. I would love to be able to input it into a space-based repetition app like Anki to complement my learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"You should focus on improving the gramatical guidebook. This app quickly becomes "" memorize exercise and repeat"". I'm currently in diamond league with almost 3000 XP more than the second place, and I don't speak french at all. The explanation to something as confusing as Reflexive verbs in French (to English) starts with the headline ""LET'S TALK ABOUT REFLEXIVE VERBS"" And then it is literally 2 lines of text followed by 2 examples. I don't know why or when to say ""nous nous"" or ""je me"" etc."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love Duolingo. I'm getting used to the new format. My lessons are building on each other but I feel like I have forgotten much of what I already learned since it's not as easy to practice old lessons. It can be done but it's hard to find what I need to practice. My biggest request right now is that Duolingo provide the button to slow down the audio when I am having to record myself speaking the language. It would help to hear it slowed down when I am struggling to pronounce things correctly.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it's really good for vocabulary but it's so important to use what you learn here in the outside world. many users of this app fall into the trap, as I have on many occasions, of enjoying the game of gaining points without making a direct association between what we are learning on the screen and actual communication with people. so this can be one component in a larger plan for learning a language in my case for brushing up italian."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"the application's idea is good, topics are fine, but exercises/sentences are quite repetitive, making it boring , and many of them are useless for daliy use. sometimes, the app does not count the points, and also, when I almost finish all the steps, the app restarted all of my lessons, so I had to start from the beginning, which was pretty waste of time."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Paid the high subscription cost 'cause I hated the heart system. Now have LEAGUE FATIGUE. Leagues should be optional! Sucks to slip into lower leagues then have to grind to stay in the Promotion Zone. They also rarely fix errors. Example: On some multiple choice questions, there are 3 possible answers. Only 1 is correct. HOWEVER, 2 of the answer choices are IDENTICAL. If you don't guess the right one, even if you're correct, it's marked WRONG. I'll try a different app rather than reubscribing."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I appreciate this app and have learned much. They have a lot of updates and the app runs smoothly. I only wish they had a bit more of a study curriculum for those that like the bookwork to make it stick more(outside the practice option you have to pay for). There's a good mix of listening, typing, and talking in lessons. But also a decent number of ads that play after you finish a lesson or two. Over the years, the ads have become more common."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Updated review- use the paid version now - no ads. If you use everyday, consider paying. My least favorite thing is lack of Grammer info. It's 99% intuitive. Have to supplement with books etc. Original review: great tool. The app teaches you to read, write, speak and listen. Love the motivation not to make mistakes so you can keep going. Charming positive feedback on process. Ads are not intrusive. Bit I'd like to move on to new material faster. feels like I'm in the same place too long."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A little annoying to get started, or at least can take a while to get much vocabulary, but the effort is worth it. A subscription is necessary to avoid waiting through ads, though I'm willing to support the app. I do like how you can literally use it anywhere, from a few minutes whenever you get the chance, to as long as you can reasonably focus on studying."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Duolingo for about a decade and they have come a long way from their start with the updates to improve learning and increase their available languages to learn. A little practice each day goes a long way toward fluency with each language and when you fall off from your practice, it gives an estimate near the actual loss of learning you'd have experienced. I've recently started back and it's suggested returning point made fixing my mistakes less frequent than where I left off."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A good app if you know the basics of the language and want to continue learning. The heart system makes learning a new alphabet/words difficult unless you write them down as you go. I'm doing fine with the Japanese course since I took some in high school but gave up on Spanish because of the heart system. Annoying things: Streak Freezes disappearing even if you don't use them, where you are in a tree will change when they update, the Super Duolingo ad is the most common ad after every lesson"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have been using Duolingo for a few months now. It started as I wanted to pick up some French for work, but has become a part of my daily routine now. The app is very well designed, and does a pretty good job to gamify it and keep you on track. The best part is that so far, nothing is hidden behind a paywall. The ads are actually relevant and not much intrusive. The learning system is well designed. The only thing I think is missing is more prompts on grammatical rules and maybe a dictionary."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've gone from zero Spanish to slightly conversational mostly using Duo. I'd never have gotten there without it, the low time investment to ramp up and the game style were life changing. that said, there are downsides. too focused on keeping you in high engagement, when by halfway through you should be focusing on conversation and listening to real people, instead of trying to finish the course. Also some words are just wrong - no one calls a normal hat a sombrero. but overall huge benefits."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm delighted with the Duolingo app for learning Arabic. The lessons are engaging, the interface is user-friendly, and the gamified approach keeps me motivated. The gradual progression in difficulty ensures a solid grasp of the language. Overall, a stellar language-learning experience! I have a query. I've completed section 1 and moved on to section 2; however, I can't find the speaking practice exercises despite enabling them in the settings. Could you please look into this issue promptly?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Awesome app. Definetely helps me learn Spanish. I just wish (and this is not only towards Duolingo) we could learn words that people actually use. Like ""correo electronico,"" NOBODY uses that phrase/wording. They either say ""correo"" or just straight up ""email."" I understand it is ""correct,"" but it is not relevant. This is something that most language courses get wrong. I understand collaquialisms can vary by location, but there are some modern changes that span the entire Spanish speaking world."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is, in my opinion, the perfect blend of learning and fun. The colorful tasks and interactive learning style is really affective! And they don't just drop a ton of info on you and start testing you on all these different aspects of a new language. Instead, Duolingo gradually introduces you to new terms and functions of the language of your choice, all the while refreshing you on information you've learned in the past. All around, really fun and easy to love!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is prerty great. But of course, like every other person, I hate the ads, except for the one thats for Super Duolingo. That one is very great. But going to the main topic, very nice learning experience, you can also learn the alphabet of the language you are learning which is pretty cool. Not only you learn words, but also its letters. Pretty great app in my opinion. It is a fun language learning app, filled with tons of fun and also the streak system. It is amazing, very great."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's very good for learning with it's leader board, strike score, and friend quest keeping you coming back for a otherwise mundane task. About the friend thing, it's a lot better with friends doing it along with you! Also, you should be mindful that learning a new language will take a lot of time and that is any different with Duolingo. Anyways, good luck learning!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy it, great at helping you build consistency, I've tried a few language apps, and I think this is done mostly well, though I don't like how language is taught generally. I think it'd be better if lessons revolved around themes, and involved many routes of conversation. Themes like chores, work, dining, music, etc. Say theme is watching movie, I'd like the lesson to go from planning, buying a ticket, snacks, watching, then finally discussing, characters, events, themes, emotions, etc."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"the option to learn at ones pace is missing. instead its more of a competition to top a league or to move to the next lesson. therefore the focus is competitive than actually learning to speak and write the language. we should be able to have the option to enter a league or to session and advance once mastering it; once setup a session then, then it should state a time frame to finish and promoted to another session until we master the language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"you get punished for making mistakes by losing hearts which are needed to complete the lessons, this gets so frustrating as you can't complete the learning and you end up being demotivated. not enough of an explanation when you do make a mistake and there is no list of words you've learnt so you can't recap when you've had a couple of days off. it's all designed so you pay for the full version."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm having so much fun learning and it is sticking with me slowly, which is so much better than I was expecting. I wish there were more picture options as I find they are funny and help me remember better but all in all the fact you can do this for free if you want is AMAZING!! plus they don't drown you in ads but you can buy premium if you want and it's not crammed down you throat üíãü§å. Many thanks to the creators and all the team that keep Duolingo up and running."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"it's ok. it's lacking certain features to make it a comprehensive way to learn a language: no list of words currently learnt. I can't refer back to all the words I've already learnt in a course, yet the app keeps track of how many I've encountered so far. grammar isn't well explained at any point. the app relies heavily on trial and error and so often leaves you with little to no direction for certain questions. the voice recognition can be temperamental. the appshould be used as a supplement."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Personally, I think duolingo is a really good way to learn a new language! It's fun easy and helps you remember. but if you lose your lives you can't keep learning which loses the whole point of learning a new language or you can by a monthly subscription or diamonds to refill your hearts. Also you can't pick what you want to learn first, you have to follow a pattern. üíö"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The language learning is great overall, but the new heart mechanic makes is really obnoxious to get past harder levels. I understand that they are trying to promote doulingo plus and make money, but I feel the hearts sometimes defeats the purpose of learning from your mistakes. I am fine with ads and some locked content, as that is completely understandable. To put it simply, 5 limited hearts ruined doulingo. Till they make a compromise, I have to stay at 3 starts."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Useful as a learning supplement. However the lessons can get very repetitive and often have a distinct AI generated feel with either very slow progression, questions not really matching the topic of the lesson, or having new words introduced in random places before they've been taught (like in word matching exercises where you can't see the meaning). You can no longer download the lessons, and the whole app is regularly buggy with the ui not working as intended."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"9 days in it's taught me a lot and kept me engaged. Feels almost too easy, but I'm learning each day. It does get slightly more difficult with each step, but it helps you practice and get there."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Duolingo. I think that (je pense que) it is an excellent app for people of all ages to learn languages, and with the addition of maths and music - it's too good! One thing which is a bit rubbish (un peu nul) is Duo, constantly asking me to upgrade for super; but that's a minor thing that's annoying with the app, which made me give it 5 stars!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love it, it is slow learning but you can start learning and practice at your pace. I don't use premium there you can do as much as a mistake. I would like to buy a premium but then I am tight on budget."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I dont know any Hebrew. Luckily, the app has an option for that. So I started ""from scratch"". Immediately I was asked to translate words that were both written in and vocalized in Hebrew. I dont know any Hebrew and so I got it wrong *sarcastic surprise*. Next 3 questions were exactly the same. And then I didnt have any hearts (which are necessary to do lessons?) The Arabic course is wayyy better. But now i don't have hearts, so I'll try Drops Really. How was I supposed to answer correctly?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I'm using the app to refresh on my french before visiting Europe and it's helping a lot. Duolingo tests you to figure out what your level of knowledge is and gives you the exercises that help.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is really awesome makes you feel like you are playing a game highly recommend you will learn the language you want to know in just a few months very little adds and if there are adds there are just adds from Duolingo itself and it is great online and offline again highly recommend
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Everything good so far, except for the 3 star owl, which only gives 1.45 min, including listening to looong audio, clicking continue each question, all for 20 questions. I am not sure if the 3 stars is possible. ü´†"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a good and fun app, that is actually practical, in terms of helping you develop your skills within another language regardless of your prior level."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,great place to start with a language but could at times be improved by having an option to explain grammar rules rather than only learning them by trial and error.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like the app, I own the yearly subscription, and make my relatives learn the languages hustle free. One note, though - recently, animations in my app stopped working completely. Dunno what to do"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"will be 5 starts if I can scroll back within the same lesson unit, just like a book. sometimes I remember or want to check something after a particular page. this function will be very useful, instead of having to complete the entire lesson before scrolling to the particular lesson I will like"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's pretty fun, but it's hard to keep up a streak. I hate that the leagues are not optional, so I have to take some stars away, but overall a pretty good app. I would recommend it if you have time for it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I totally love Duolingo. Its really helpful but the problem is that they have no off days and everyone needs an off day ones In a while. So if they added that feature on the app it would be really helpful
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Audio quality for Danish is severely lacking, and hasn't improved at all since I wrote my initial review 5 years ago. There also appears to be a slight delay in audio when I'm using my Bluetooth earbuds."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I just got a B1 German certificate and all I did was use duolingo two hours a day every day for seven months, without paying a cent. On the basis of that alone I'd give 5 stars, but the app has been removing useful features like community discussion and forcing limited tries on even desktop users now so I don't think what I did would be possible anymore due to the sheer time wasted grinding for hearts."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's the best app for learning languages. Very fun to spend time with. Cool features. I specifically like the ability to refill hearts with exercising. Solid 5/5.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a nice app overall..one of the best language learning apps really. My problem tho is, most times, I'll earn gems and I'll not be given those gems. Like, earlier today, I earned 25 gems. It didn't reflect. It's not the first time this is happening. I'd like my gems back please ü•∫"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Stop with this DEI nonsense. Duo wasn't like this in the past. Why is every single guy talking about wearing dresses and every man has a boyfriend? That really makes it confusing to learn a language when you can't differentiate between friend, boyfriend, girlfriend, etc. Seriously, just stop."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I am on Unit 4 of Arabic and it's incredibly frustrating to learn the sounds of words or learn their spelling without being shown their translation in English. Almost feels pointless. Why can't we see the meaning of words in audio questions?? I know this option is available for Apple iOS users but not Android. Renders this app useless.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"So, I've used this app on and off for years now. Both the free and the paid for versions are great. But the $ is outrageous, esp if you can't afford to pay a year all at once. Worse is that you can get 1 week free if you refer someone. Its like a tease. Finally, save enough to pay it so I can have the unlimited hearts. Didn't mind losing the ads, at least not until realizing how much longer it takes to save up gems now. You get 5 at a time. But need 100s-1000s for everything!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I get why there exists a pay element but the heart system as a limiting factor really is a pain right when you're starting to make real progress. If you want to learn a language using Duolingo but are short on cash for now, you're gonna have to pay with your time."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Problems with audio. +Constant changes of courses are rather pointless unless it ACTUALLY necessary ( mistakes in exercises, etc) but that's more subjective matter."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I'll be honest it's kind of annoying with all the ads now but it's a helpful learning app plus it's super fun (and even more helpful) when you have a subscription so either way I say it's worth the install
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Sometimes it is glitchy with judging things as typed errors in grammar that are correct & sometimes audio pronunciation from one voice is difficult to hear but otherwise a good refresher course!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Hi duolingo is good app ü¶¢ . It is very easy to learn languages and a bit tough. yup , by my pointer view you have to teach us in language by our choice. for example : I am learning turkish I want that duolingo pronounciate it in urdu like this the word ""sandvic "" it is in turkish . duolingo have to pronounciate it in urdu . just like that it ask us which language you want to learn we told it same like this it had to ask in which language I have to pronounciate. but nice it is nice app . üïäüíÆ"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"really good way to learn but only having 5 ""lives"" means if you get stuck on a topic, you can't revisit it for a few hours (unless you pay) so that can make learning more difficult"

I do rate this 5 earlier when they offer limited hearts. but can understand as paid can help them to run more longer. really happy with this app. thanks
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Down to two stars due to the ridiculous amount of inappropriate ads. Literally every other one at the moment is for Duplingo Premium or an AI chat bot app which brags about being NSFW, fulfilling all your fantasies and better than your ex. Not appropriate at all for an educational app which probably has a large base of minors as its users"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Used to be great, but the new update has made it terrible. Progress is much harder and more confusing now. If they reverted back to the old UI and progression system, it would be 4 or 5 stars."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,this app is very good for learning different languages and it also does not Bore while learning as it is fun as we play games and we also face challenges which make us more stronger and sharper to think we can memorize it very well
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's preety good to learn languages but the main problem is everytime I finish a lesson it gives an ad and I hate the heart system in Duolingo because we only have 5 hearts and if you make 5 mistakes you have to wait for 15 hours total to get 5 hearts or give diamonds and if you don't want ads you have to pay to have super Duolingo it's kinda P2L(Pay to Learn)
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love the motivation and games. It is by far the longest that I have stuck to a language app. I couldn't find a place to study vocab but it looks like they added a spot so I am a happy guy!

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's really helped me improve on my understanding of Spanish my only complaint is that you can only make 5 mistakes while learning until you have to wait to try again meanwhile it dosent exactly tell you what words mean which right off the bat it is heavily reliant on trial and error while only giving you the ability to make 5 mistakes
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,You probably should add every nation national language I didn't find nepali language I just want to suggest to a person here but its very difficult..

"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"They made it worse. They got rid of a bunch of lessons to ""improve"" the user experience. In addition past lessons that were completed have new sets of rules that I never learned. I'm very disappointed in this latest update."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Months into these lessons and still cannot have even the most basic conversation. Can't even ask for help or directions if I happen to be in the country. My BF is a native speaker, says the pronunciation is awful. But I don't have any other options for learning the language available to me."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Old Duolingo was so fun. I especially enjoyed the tree format. But the path format is just so boring. And the super duo thing. This used to be the best app. Idk so many kids are on this platform how are we supposed to pay lol.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app. Learning is so easy and straightforward. It's easy to pick up where you left off with options to review. And it's easy to move forward with options to level up. And that's the free version of the app!

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I am currently doing Spanish and Korean. It is a way to learn without feeling so much like work. You can do it anywhere because you can turn the speaking (and listening if needed) off for a while.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,this is a great app but not a lot of room for mistake. it kind of forces you to watch ads or buy premium. but efficient. takes time on each subject. recommend

I really appreciate I am not rushed, also it stays with the lesson long enough to make sure I become familiar with the phrases. then add one word at a time.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a cool app that does really help improve your language skills but the reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is because after you delete it (didn't finish course) it still sends you messages

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app has come a long way since I started using it years ago. The languages you can learn are plentiful and its a great tool when paired with other language learning apps. This one is one of the best.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,enjoying it so far. very structured learning. right from the basics. might consider getting the paid version after a few more lessons to see how to goes
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's good for learning new languages it's also good if you run out of hearts because it makes you work for them even harder, which makes learning faster."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's been working good for me, though I can't say much since I just started yesterday. the languages to choose from are a lot, but it's kind of a bummer that there's no sign language (or I just didn't see it-) overall a great way to learn languages! ^_^"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"really enjoying it. picking up loads due to the repetition, revisiting learned stuff and different methods (multiple choice, typing, speaking etc)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,language learning in small steps and repetitions until you know the words and sentenced what only is that the speaking excercises are not always usable depending on where you are just as in the japanese learning app where only speaking is the task
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The app is very good to learn a language. But it crashes often when you did not update to the latest version when they release it.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very beneficial and an efficient app. I love it, I had lost most of the French I had learned in high school but this brings it back and improves it also."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,You pay full price. You get no customer service. You lose the game a lot because they will remove your completed quests after you've done them. They've had years to get better and have not. The lack of customer service is horrendous.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Learning with Duo is fun, sometimes frustrating - but it's addictive, and I can tell it's working, too! I'm getting my French back, and my confidence with it!"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Absolutely amazing app for learning any language faster and quicker. It is very playful and I learnt french from it very quicker comparing from any other app. It is very helpful and also free . I love this app. Thanks üòÑ
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have been learning English with Duolingo for a year and one day sound of characters stopped working. I still receive furious notifications on my mail but I can't learn, because sound is broken."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing, I'm on my 30 day streak, I'm addicted to opening my future's possibilities. I'm learning French and I've learned more than I thought. Having a streak and Duo reminding me to do my lessons really keeps me going."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,App speaking test picks up on background noise and doesn't end even tho the background was just a kid tapping on the table. Especially for times test it waste 20 seconds.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Not really good for travel, unwise to use to reach fluency. good for entertainment and to familiarize yourself with a language more."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I haven another opinion about your app is that~we need to chat in this app without friends to interact and with dualingo bird to interact.. when we chat in this dual go app without friends we will be able to understand the language which we are studying An they might be helping us.üòä there is one more opinion that in this app you want to add chat GPT or chat bot option
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app combined with Gymglish's Frantastique has been helpful. By itself, DuoLingo really only works for building your vocabulary, but not really for language rules or pronounciation."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Had to restart my Japanese course from zero because the update changed the course and left me at a place far beyond my level. Over a year of steady progress gone.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Hooks you with some toxic gamification elements, teaches you some basics of a language, provides a nice structure for learning, but does a poor job at adapting to your level or language goals"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I am enjoying learning from Duolingo because if we make any mistake, it corrects it and tells us that it should have happened like this and it also gives us a chance not to repeat our mistake again."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great for common language to learn like Spanish. With Swahili (Language of Kenia and Tanzania) it's not as good but stil ok. In general I don't like that you learn a lot of ""proper"" / ""fancy"" talking and not what real people speak. Especially for Swahili."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"No star rating at all if possible, this app is dead with the new update, not working and saying ""you're offline, no network"" whilst there is perfect working network."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It helps us to learn many languages Just keep a remainder or just give 3 or 10 or 15 or 20 or 30 minutes to it and a streak that want and you have learned the language that you want I am learning Korean and it is too Just to easy to learn So download it now fast yay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"When are they going to put audio exercises in The English course, that is, Some stories but they are only audio like the Adventures with Bea from The Spanish Course, I think that in this way they reinforce The English more for us"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a great app to learn languages in a fun way too . My only complaint is I wish you add a payment for a single month cause paying for the whole year is too much üíî on one time so please üôè considering adding it
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It can be fun but I have learned that when it comes to your streak of how many days straight you have gone it every so often claims you have missed a day and makes you use a streak freeze even when you haven't. So don't get upset when it says you missed a day but you know you didn't. It just happens.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,In Spanish many questions tell you right or wrong but with no translation. I n Irish I cannot hear some of the words...either the whole word or the end of words. Otherwise it's great.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I can learn many languages but I wanted to learn Malayalam. Because I like malyalam.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I dint expect this much from an app actually.....it doesn't give much help those who want to learn how to write also......but it makes easy to learn a language faster.....brighter.....I feel it is helpfull for all ages....

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"super fun app. the speaking parts aren't really accurate though.. but if you use more sources than only Duolingo, you get a good shot at learning new languages"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,it's pretty good it has been pretty successful in getting me to at least memorize things however I will say I wish the accessibility was a little bit better as there are moments where I can't actually speak vocally off the time but I still want to complete the assignment.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I find the practices to be very simple. They lead you through all the pronunciations. And the difference between the subtleties in the language in the context of the language. If you pay attention and what's going on, you have or shouldn't have any reason to not learn the language you're wanting to."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"this is the best application to learn language easily. it has a game type system that didnt bore me and I can learn any languages in it,I am learning Japanese on it and I am very fast to learn I know a hundred words in Japanese so you can use it ! good app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"While the basic concept of the app is good, it spends too much time on regurgitating stuff you already know and neverade a mistake in, while insufficiently explaining new concepts and repeating hard stuff you failed. also the Vikram hotline is terrible and useless"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very good language learning game because you think that your playing a game but your actually learning! Very entertaining for children and adults. in my opinion I would recommend Doulingo if you want to learn other languages. thanks for reading my opinion ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòÅ
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Update: Trying Danish now and it's apparent that less popular languages offer a lesser learning experience like low quality recordings, no stories and more prevalent bugs. Sad. My biggest regret with respect to languages is not having learned about Duolingo earlier. And I've had a paid subscription to Rosetta Stone for years! Go with DL!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,its really good and best app for learning so many languages to learn they also make it fun to remember things I loved it!! it free as well and good quality!! loved it keep it up . this app deserves respect from all over world every one can learn !! such a amazing app .

I can confirm that it works because my friend can understand me and sometimes me too(I haven't learned much) I would recommend to try this app
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It is a good basic app but there are no real explanations of grammar, accents, pronouns etc. You learn how to speak phrases but you need to work out the rest yourself"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great use of gamification to motivate learning and time on task but a wee bit frustrating not to be able to access any extra help to explain a grammar rule.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I upgraded to super so I didn't have to deal with ads. The widget with the owl who turns colors later in the day reminds me to practice at least once a day.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app for learning a new language. But the number of available languages are limited. Add more Indian languages like telugu, tamil, kannada, malayalam, bengali, marathi for english speakers and I will give you a 5 star."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It was 5 star until I tried to stop the auto renewal charges. Even though you cancel the renewal on the app they still charged me. I emailed them and no reply. Unscrupulous to not make it easy to leave the membership.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I give this a 4 because its a great game to make language's easier and fun but u only have 5 hearts sometimes they fill it up for you but for unlimited hearts u have to pay quite a lot more than I expect.hope this helps.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app has a lot of mistakes even in English, like ""little dog"" instead of ""puppy"". In Ukrainian they have a lot of pronunciation mistakes and even give russian words instead of Ukrainian, which is very unprofessional. And the team of Duolingo should stop promotion russia, russians and their language, as they came with the war to Ukraine in 2022 and still continuing the genocide of Ukrainian civilians!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"too much translating from Spanish to English, I don't need to learn English, it is a waste of time you don't learn translating into English. if you could only leave English to English-to- Spanish translation might have a value, else you should remove it altogether and leave everything in spanish"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app for a long time - have a current streak of 1,600 days - to learn Japanese. It was (past tense purposeful) a good starting point for this, however as time went on it has become worse and worse as an end user. They push so hard for you to sign up for premium, when many of the ""benefits"" used to be free and sensible - like having unlimited tries instead of 5 hearts thereby limiting how much you can learn in a day. I plan to keep going, but suggest using something else."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,this app is great for learning a bew language. The only thing wrong with this app is that sometimes it skips ahead and sometimes is hard to learn.It is still an awesome way to learn a new language
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Duolingo saved my 160 day streak even when all my streak freezes were used and I had no network connection. It's highly appreciable and encourages me to spend more time on it now. Keep up the good work! ‚ú®

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The lessons are really fun and engaging. It a little repetitive but it's done the job of helping me commit the language to memory
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I think duolingo is a great app to learn new languages like Dutch ,German , Russian and more . But I also think they could teach more languages such as at least bulgarian or lithuanian."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I'm really loving learning the basics of language with Duolingo. It's a lot of repetition but it is beginning to stick.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm very happy with how easy it is to practice and get eased into gradually speaking etc. I love the gamification. I will definitely stick with this because it's so helpful. I am having two small difficulties. One is technical, sometimes the sound won't play on listening exercises which is a pain. The other might be my learning style or because I'm studying Korean, but I do use You tube for additional resources to explain pronunciations and understand complex vowels etc."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've been on Duo for almost 3 years. Who knew I could learn so many languages so fast. I truly love Duolingo. There is a free version and I'm so glad they have a monthly payment option if you're really serious about learning a new language. Thank you for this app to the creator and developers!! :)
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"used to be good. turning on the 'dont show listening/speaking exercises' in the accessibility settings doesnt work and those questions still show. The app has also recently laid off actual translators to prioritise A.I. translations, which are inaccurate and dont flow in the languages, especially smaller languages, which are already closer to dying out. the term 'enshittification' once again applies to anothet app, now duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The lessons are easy to follow, and I feel like I can make good progress even on the free version, my only complaint is with the volume. The speaking is so quiet I have to turn the volume up, but then the ads are deafening even for the volume level I'm on! Not ideal when I usually practice either right after I wake up or before I go to sleep!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Simply put, Duolingo is a great leaning tool whether you are an absolute beginner or whether you already have a good knowledge of a language and need a refresher course, or if you want to take it to the max and be fluent. It's up to you, the app will recognise your ability and challenge you as well as reinforcing what you already know. It's a really fun way to learn languages, and as an android user I look forward to studying music & mathematics (for a bit of brain training) as soon as it's out"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"duolingo is an extremely useful app but the fact that they decided to go for AI and fire a big fraction of the human personal is alarming and probably a sign that it will turn worse. I will be, unfortunately, seeking alternatives"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The ""perfect lesson"" is likely to become your daily objective every once in a while, and it is INFURIATING when you can't do it. One mistake can ruin the lesson's objective!! Maybe it's my mistake after all. Why am I relying on daily missions? Yeah. After some elaborate thinking, maybe it's my fault. But I'll just send my review for consideration anyways. Thank you"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,A wide array of different languages compared to other apps. I love different cultures but as a raging pothead I would have never thought I would have picked this up and ran with it... so that should say something. They packaged it in a fun cheeky manner . I like the idea you get to revisit previous challenges and best yourself. I never thought I could learn Chinese.... well here we are
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"For a free app, this is pretty great. The only thing that needs improvement is the speaking exercises, as it sometimes marks items as correct before you finish."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"While I the app is ok, I find I have to go outside to other free sources to completely understand some of the concepts. I started with the free version then received an email offering me a 6.99 a month subscription. I clicked the link and signed up. When the charge came through it was 90 something dollars for the whole year. It referred me to google play for questions and I couldn't resolve it there. Very unhappy with their lack of clarity on subscriptions and customer service sucks too."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'll be honest, I haven't tried other apps, but I really do love this one. The friends feature is great and helps motivate me based on where others are growing, too. It's helpful, but not overwhelming, with its reminders and notifications. I particularly like the widget that stares me down on my home screen to remind me to practice! thanks for the help, Duolingo!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"so far so good. I have just started the second module. so instead of a rookie I am now and explorer. there are lessons I need a little deeper understanding of, and I'm looking forward into what other resources there are on the app. I am learning and enjoying"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Android app doesn't have a Words option under Practice for Japanese. There are no Stories or Listening exercises, even though those sections are there. You cannot move the word tiles around like you can on the web app. The voices are irritating and distracting. There should also be a way to turn off the saying of the word for a tile when you click it. Day 45 and it is still focusing on ""water"", ""sushi"", ""lawyer"", ""doctor"", ""cool"", ""nice"", etc. It only teaches numbers 1-3, colors red / white"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is amazing. My children and I love it and are learning a lot. I do not like that I can not easily switch from a single plan to a family plan subscription. I also don't like that my daughters and I have different looking apps. I get the one on an iPhone being different, but the one with the same phone as I have an app that looks different than mine. We also have a friend who can't add friends at all when the rest of us can. More stars to be given if single-family switch were made easier."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The gamification really gets me engaged. I thought I wouldn't, but I'm actually improving my Spanish thanks to this app. I even dared to start Chinese and Russian. Really nice! There's only one problem: I want to learn Croatian badly, but they don't have such a language yet. Recommended!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"They are often not accurate when it comes to speaking the way locals speak. A year or more ago I was super engaged in learning a new language and tried the Super Duolingo but forgot to discontinue it before my credit card was charged. Then they completely changed the way they taught so the pages upon pages of notes and practicing the way I had, was wasted! I have pretty much given up on learning the Swahili and now just do a language that comes easy to me. Don't waste your money!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great app to learn any language you want. Fun to learn using this app so if you are going to another country or something you can use Duolingo and not google translate to do your spanish hw. Duolingo is your green owl who is fun to learn different languages with!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Unfortunately, they recently change from recordings of actual people to clearly computer voices. Would have been 5 stars before this change. Makes is far more difficult to learn because it sounds so fake."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Quality has really gone down hill, I've been using Duolingo for several years and as the lessons have really gotten worse. There is no longer any explanation for how anything works or any way to find out the correct answer. As AI integration continues the sentences being constructed in the lessons are getting less useful, and the correct answers are becoming inconsistent from lesson to lesson. I want to continue learning languages not play opaque guessing games between advertisements."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"the App is well done, you learn through a lot of repetition ( although sometimes too slowly) Personally, I need more grammar structure to understand the ""why"" and rules, so I am complementing with other learning aids. Also, I found myself getting totally distracted by the competitive leaderboards making it more about getting Xp points than following my lessons. But overall, I like it and will continue."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Member since November 2015. Since then, I have loved Duolingo as a method to dip my toe into Italian, Spanish, Turkish, Russian, and German, and to help me get to higher fluency in Italian. However, the news that Duolingo laid off 10% of its contract translators and replaced them with AI is unacceptable. Machines and programs can never replace humans, human connection, and human understanding of the nuance of language. I deleted my account and I am beyond disappointed with Duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"We love Duolingo! We use it to learn different languages, and we're getting very good at German, but I admit I am personally struggling a bit with Russian. That's okay. I can always go back and review lessons when I need to. I have also just learned of Duolingo's plans to add music and math to the app because my daughter showed me a promo video, to the effect. We're so excited about this! I hope it goes as well as our German lessons! Thank you, Duolingo!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A wonderful app that makes learning a language fun and engaging. It's even better if you have a friend using Duolingo as well, you can push each other to learn competitively!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It does have it said backs, but in the long run. It teaches you the basics of everything you need to know of a language. Been practicing Norwegian for a little bit. And I feel like I can conversate to the whole world of Norway."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I find duolingo good, but there's a couple problems that make learning difficult in the Japanese course: 1. There's no vocab list. I get 20+ vocab lists dropped and there's no way to see a list for review. I know other languages have this, but not Japanese for some reason? Why!? 2. No way to skip or customize kanji practice. I already know a few Kanji, but instead of letting me test out of them or skip ahead, it makes me practice the beginning ones 10+ times to get to the ones I don't know."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good app. However when the new avatars came out I couldn't change my profile pic it said error occured, I switched to my brother's account and I let him. I've tried uninstall and reinstall but It didn't work."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Having used it for a month, it has got a bit samey and boring at times. Overall it's a really good app but I still struggle with understanding what the characters say as they speak so quickly and I would like to learn more grammar to understand it better (French). The French, unfortunately, is very Americanised. The rest of Europe doesn't phrase things the same way as the Americans, so you get marked down for not phrasing it like an American which is a bit silly and very confusing at times."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I really like this app been on it for about 450 days and it's almost perfect. Now I have three problems with it. #1 I got but into a ranked league very late which was slightly annoying. #2 When you run out of hearts you can do practice which just makes you learn words you already MASTERED so I'd suggest you just make them learn the newest words or the ones you have been bad at. #3 Doesn't change anything in the learning but that they change the unit system so much and I'm about to run out of wo
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Too many pointless updates that do nothing to improve the actual functionality of the app or the lessons. As for the quality of the teaching, there needs to be more and better explanation of the structure of the language. There is little in way of teaching grammar, rather you learn phrases parrot fashion. The phrases you learn are mostly useless for everyday conversation. The positive side is its good to get you started and for practice. Do not expect to learn the language just using this app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I enjoy this app for a variety of reasons. I am a slow learner and suck at languages. Duo provides me with lots of repetition. Duo offers enough variety in learning methods to keep me interested. I still freeze instantly if some one speaks to me in Spanish ( the language I have been trying to learn for decades) but I believe Duo is helping. I struggle with the new Duolingo learning method of the person talking to an audience on a podcast but it is exactly what I appear to need. Thanks Duo
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The ads are not super intrusive. If you are progressing well you can learn a lot on the free version. If you start making mistakes, your pace will drop due to the limits on mistakes. Offers tons of languages you can start to learn little by little. There are some occasional slightly of English translations of words or phrases but generally it seems pretty accurate."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"5 stars -> 2 stars -> 1 star 1. Stupid hearts that ruin the whole idea of the app. (You NEED mistakes to learn!) 2. Extortion of money to be able to learn again. 3. Lots of buggs. Like ""Oh, we failed to save you progress and mark the lesson done, but we didn't forget about the hearts you had lost doing it"". 4. Now the mute button in adds disappeared. 5. And no, you can't send a bug report or feedback. The form just doesn't submit."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is really great when learning some words & phrases in Spanish (Or any language) and can be very helpful when you need it. I love the short stories we get during our path too, although, there's only one or two on each subject and it can take a while to get to them. I like the stories not only because they're entertaining and fun, but also because they give you more sentences and words, they also help me stay more motivated to do my lessons and I wish they gave us them more."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Awesome way to learn a language. I really like how it tracks mistakes and allows you to go back over them. I think it could probably have a little bit more of an explanation of why certain verbs and other words are use the way they are because it's definitely confusing, at least for Spanish. But overall, I think it's a really great app and a great way to learn a language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app for learning a language for casual speaking but damn please fix the letter 'a' problem because I'm doing spanish currently and when a dude character comes up and uses 'a' and I write un I get it wrong because it's una when it's obviously not and I lose all my hearts because of that problem, but other than that it's a great app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm enjoying my time on Duolingo. While I'm not anywhere close to fluency, I realize I know a lot more than I thought due to repetition and regular practice. It will help to use a secondary source of learning that explains things in greater detail -- grammar, sound changes, batchim, etc, but Duolingo is an excellent way to bolster the learning process."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This thing op. Like the incorporation of the widget was just genius, It's funny every time I see of the creepy owl (love it btw) slowly melting...Been years I've been on here, finally maintaining a streak. I've learnt a lot, thanks a bunch!"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The old format was hands down a 5 star app. Loved it. I'm really disappointed in new format. It is so limiting on which lesson you can do. I used to go back and practice previous lessons, but can't do that any longer. The new format also looks like a game (like Candy Crush). Ugh - you just completely diminished the respectability of the app. It is so kidish now."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great as a language app but it feels not complete? Would be 5 if some minor issues were fixed that are present in the app. overall, grateful for the help in learning languages."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely the best, most well organized and beautifully presented course. My learning Spanish has been a very satisfying journey and I know I am well supported along the way. Mucho Gusto!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm so annoyed; I was progressing well, got to a ninth day streak and half way through to unit 2. This evening I receive a notification to say I have three hours to complete my ninth day streak, which I've completed already. I then go into the app, and it's taken me back to unit 1! It's lost most of my progress. It's such a shame as I was genuinely enjoying learning with Duolingo, but I'm moving away from it now...I'm not progressing again only for the app to glitch on me again."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I joined duolingo at the start of 2023, and since I was a beginner at german, it was helpful. But it doesn't introduce new words often enough. We should have time to learn other words and everything but I haven't learnt a new word in a while and its mostly review, which is helpful but at the same time its too much review and so little learning new sentences and words. It also doesn't teach you how to actually pronounce the words, which is not very helpful. It pronounces them but doesnt teach you"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"After 105 days of using this software I think this a fairly good app although it does lack some features that one might expect to see on a language app. Principally the lack of a library of words you've learnt or encountered, I mean - really? The interface is easy to navigate but some of the exercises are weak and more real-life dialogues and situations would create a more valid learning experience."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's good for starting out on language learning to see if it's something you'd like. It's also got a ton of languages and always adding more. Only gets 4 stars because the only thing it's really good at is building vocabulary.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Just great, if put to good use, Duolingo is just a fun game-like language app. I personally use it as a complement of my actual learning process. Though the Chinese lessons are great, I'd appreciate if there was an option for personalizing the characters you do know. That is, doing nivelation tests, similar to those for the rest of the lessons. Apart from that aspect, really good one."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hi, this is really the greatest idea. It's an app if we could glue a child to it from infancy like it would be for Facebook and the others, would benefit him or her over all the screen time that would be ""wasted"". Social media never added a penny for my time but in this case its a win for everyone else."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Every time I finish an exercise I get a loading screen that won't go away. Apart from that the app is ok. A bit repetitive, but fine. I heard it was better before"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is the perfect balance of optional pay for style of learning and usability without pay. I prefer having limited hearts as I believe I get lazy and learn less when I get unlimited mistakes. That said if you learn with quantity, paying for the year would be for you. With that I believe the amount is fair. The approach duolingo takes to teach other languages has been fun and thorough and I highly recommend it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Every day I open the app this week, I'm on a completely different segment of my course because they can't seem to decide on how they want it structured. It makes actually focusing on my lessons and learning difficult when I don't have any way of knowing what I'll be learning or when I'm suddenly placed in the middle of a new section full of unfamiliar terms and conjugations just because there was another arbitrary adjustment pushed. I understand making changes, but this is ridiculous!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app used to be alright but the translations have steadily gotten more and more inaccurate - in addition, i think it's incredibly ghoulish that the company has laid off actual translators in favor of AI, which commonly makes mistakes and won't be able to provide accurate validation checks the way humans would. will not be reinstalling the app if the AI trend continues."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I try to practice DuoLingo every day, and quite honestly, I love it. I know that the phrases and words are context specific, but using the program daily has built my vocabulary to the point of being able to speak more conversationally with native Spanish speakers at work. Yes, the ads are annoying, but that's almost every free app you download. Every so often, I'm gifted with a 3-day trial for Super DuoLingo, so I take advantage of those three days!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"this app is the best thing ever. I used to not know how to say hello in French or read a conversation, but now I am an expert.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app has improved so much in recent years. The French course is massive, intuitive and provides so many activities with Super. It's worth it if you're willing to put in the effort."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It would be nice if Duolingo adds the approximate level at which we are while we are practicing on Duolingo app. Without this it's like we are doing it endlessly without knowing any parameters.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is incredible and amazing and very easy to use I've been learning Japanese Language and it's very effective as long as you maintain the consistent of wanting to learn.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"A terrible app that is designed to be annoying! Extremely repetitive to the point of being boring! What is more, it gives you the wrong clues, so you make a mistake either wayband lose a heart. For example it only suggests to translate an English preposition ""in"" as ""au"" in French when you click on it. But the right answer is ""dans""! Also its competitiveness is very frustrating, it creates anxiety and it is generally unhealthy and demotivating."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Probably the best free language-learning app out there. Obviously, it's a huge cash grab since they only give you 5 hearts daily. if you're wanting more, don't get premium, simply create a classroom and join it. Doing so gives you unlimited hearts so you can actually learn."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's user-friendly, free, and the gamified approach keeps me engaged. Highly recommend for anyone looking to start their language learning journey!"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,After a 90 day streak I took a 3-week trip to Argentina and paused Duolingo. During that time I was shamed by Duolingo for being a quitter even though I was speaking Spanish every day. Duolingo should make it possible to hit the pause button for trips that continue to exercise your new language skills.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,great educational app when it comes to learning a new language. Very entertaining and has cured boredom. Lastly is very useful and great for if you ever go traveling one day.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very nice app to use in combination with classes, this is mostly focused on memorizing vocabulary, the free version has little restrictions and the paid version is not heavily advertised."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duo is an alright app. At times, Duo expects you ""all of a sudden"" know more words and grammer. Thank goodness I had previous exposure to the language I am studying. Also, the timed exercises are silly and are costly to genuinely complete in full. These timed exercises are clearly geared for those competitive (sp?) individuals. Overall, look else where for a more practical, comprehensive language learning app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,every now and then it's a little bit too casual with it's words but otherwise it's a perfect start to get you up to an intermediate level to partially advanced level with a language

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Is there any way to controls the sound of the app? I like to study while listening to music but everytime this app make any sound, the music got distracted or even stopped."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"26 October , 2023: It gives the option to buy tools with jems but doesn't activate the tools. They don't punctuate correctly, which slows me down since I have to read statements a few times in order to understand. 6 March 2024: I'm given prizes of 15 minutes of double points which do not activate."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I used to love the Duolingo app but since I upgraded it, I have to keep uninstalling and re-installing it because it keeps saying that I'm offline and I'm not. I missing my lessons and I don't like it. Pretty annoying! ü§¨ Do something about it please. I hate missing my lessons."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"also,like sometimes its annoying how it keeps spamming reminders but when u actually listen to it ,it's actually good also if you have a child and want to learn him a new language this is the perfect app me personally Ez duolingoüóø"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"J'adore Duolingo. Duolingo is a good platform for the people like me, who love learning languages. Everything is so good and you can learn many languages on it, just loved it. Je suis LingoDude! Thank you Duo!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I am brokenhearted to have lost my 1 year streak because the app stopped giving me notification reminders. I did not turn them off. The app is still installed. Just nothing in over two weeks.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,they finally made it half decent after tons and tons of random bugs. still daily quests don't always update making it impossible to get the monthly badge and character animations don't work even if they are enabled.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"great app other than three constant suggestions to power up and buy gems to increase the time available, and without which the exercises are (IMO) almost impossible to complete."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like the practices, but the lessons are not the strong suit. It helps that I have rudimentary knowledge of German and use it to build vocabulary and practice usage."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I enjoy it so much! It helps me with a language I learned as a teen and forgot when I moved to America but I don't know if it would help as much for a person who discovers the language.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is a poorly constructed platform. There are many grammatical mistakes here. I am providing corrections, but it keeps insisting on errors."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,so far so good..will be back after completion of first language!!!..welp back kinda disappointed in the rapid review..basically eats your gems cuz it freezes the app when time runs out..then you have to force close..spent 200 gems on 2 trust just for it to do the same thing both times
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I like duolingo because it doesn't pressure you do go everyday. and it helps you with different characters.Duolingo is also fun and safe. it has challenges and expects you to do your best!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"the experience is good but languages are very few... example: thai is not there, etc... but their teaching style is good it would be nice if few more languages are added ..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy this ap and learning several different languages. I've been learning French, German, Portuguese, and Japanese. I feel like the rewards could be better based on your achievements, and I feel like they need to start with more basic words, phrases, and explanations instead of just giving the questions with no proir knowledge. Especially with masculine, feminine endings and conjugating verbs etc..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a very good app for learning new languages. The only issue I'm having is that after the first exercise the app lags and doesn't record touches and it results in bad responses or the timer passes when I get to the last question. It's not a big deal but it's annoying. Plus loosing crystals for this issue is not that cool. üòï That's why the 4 and not 5 stars. But still, great job devs!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it is a wonderful experience. it's easy and it's super addicting and it's fun! I'm learning super fast. and it provides notes and study screens and u can take as many lessons in a day as u want. there are quests ,u can make friends, compete , they have TONS AND TONS of languages. they have math and music now too! this is overall a wonderful app to use if you are serious about learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's nothing to great but it gets the job done. The only problem is that it does not really teach you the grammar of whatever language you are learning. Also there are already alot but I wish there were more courses avaliable.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Many audio files missing. Really injected itself with a lot of politics for a simple language learning app. Microsoft really bungled this acquisition.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I LOVE THIS APP HIGHLY RECOMMEND it really stinks how the hearts are limited but that's ok because the app makes up for it because I'm learning Russian because in my class at school there is a girl from Belarus that speaks Russian and we are BEST FRIENDS NOW but one really creepy thing is that if you apply the widget the images that show up telling you to practice are honestly very creepy like there is a 2 faced duo and a duo just sitting in a black room with a spotlight on him but its good üëç
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"STOP CHANGING THE COURSE DUO!!! Overall I've been learning a lot with Duolingo as I pursue Japanese (428 day streak), however the one thing that I can't stand is that every few months they rearrange the course AGAIN, and suddenly my progress is in a different section with words that I don't know being used as though they've already covered them. It's disruptive, and annoying and it destroys my sense of progress. That's why I've gone down to 2 stars from an otherwise 4 or 5 star experience"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"i personally think that duoligo cannot get better, i'm not giving it a 5 star review because i personally feel like even the best can get better, and i would love to see the app improve EVEN more. i suggest that if you DO want to use duolingo, you actually do a reasonable about of practice per week, as i've had my goals set higher then my motivation would allow, and have had a almost perfect streak be ruined because i didn't want to practice. dont make the same mistake. DUOLINGO IS THE BEST!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Can you add new words or stories to the Dutch language? That would be great! Duolingo helped me a lot, when i came to the Netherlands everyone was impressed by my understanding and communication. I've been using Duo since 2014 and i want to keep using it! Thank you!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've really enjoyed using Duo to learn a new language. while sometimes I get a bit annoyed because the lessons are repetitive, I have noticed the effect of the repetition in my comprehension, reading, writing, and speaking. Make yourself care about the weekly challenges and your streak and you'll notice a significant improvement. paying for no ads is worth it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"its really fun it teaches almost every language that you will need in the real world as in restaurants stores and much more I highly recommend this app is you are looking to learn a new language but the only down side is the payment for super but you do not have to do that if you don't want to by the way I highly recommend this app ""let's go dulingo!"" But they're also needs to be a Nigerian language in it there is some languages that are missing inside of Duolingo that needs to be added"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo makes learning fun! You practice at your own pace, and it is really working. I have increased my Spanish vocabulary so much in just one week. I can't wait to see what I can accomplish in a month or two. You earn gems and other prizes as you go. Awesome app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"this is the best app ever omg, I'm in the middle of learning Spanish in school but I can't always join my live classes so this helps a lot, I have so many friends who have this app plz download this app and you this for your own use, I'm only 14 and this app is the best"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Like it a lot for learning Latin languages, but it's starting to get buggy for me at the moment, like when I go to a lesson, when the characters on the top speak with their doulogue, their lips don't move at all, there is normally lip syncing with the duologue. Seems like their is less animation in general, I don't know if it's because I updated the app or not, but I'm not sure why that's happening, unless it's done intentionally."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have used Duolingo For several years. There is a bug in the Japanese lessons. I have been challenged to match columns of words with Kanji on one side and kana other . I get a high XP and then the screen goes gray and freezes.I cannot get out of this state. I ha e to abort the session, lose high XP and log in again and do a low XP lesson. I cannot advance as I used to. I am using the app on a Samson Android phone. Ron Steele"

I don't remember anything... and I went to a Spanish restaurant and couldn't even order food....I go on mission trips to Nicaragua and it's useless... its TOO FORMAL... but you could use it in an emergency
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"With the recent announcement of the layoff of a large percentage of their contract translators and the remaining few reviewing AI translations for ""acceptability,"" I cannot recommend this app after maintaining my 930day+ streak. Removing the human element from a learning experience to connect with other humans across cultures is abhorrent."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I love Duolingo. I've been using it for a year, and it's been great. Please fix the ad issue. I start doing any lesson and an annoyingly loud ad music plays in the background, and I can't hear anything from the lesson itself. The ad music persists even if I minimize the app. It drives me crazy, and I have to finish the lesson to close the ad. Only to have it start again at the beginning of the next lesson. This never happened before this week."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Good app but subscription feature hinders learning Abilities . Another thing need to add grammatical lessons too . it's so inconvenient sometimes to understand how the words and their conjugation occur .
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,seems easy to complete the levels. let's see if it sticks in my brain! lol! I like the way it changes up the lessons.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I don't usually take the time to leave public reviews, but I make exceptions for some things if they're worth it. As someone with legitimate ADHD, it is very difficult to keep my attention. Duolingo has made learning Spanish fun and engaging for me. I went from only knowing numbers 1-10 to being able to have a conversation, and I can now better connect with my Spanish-speaking students and neighbors. I'd upgrade to premium if I could afford it, but the free version IS well worth the download!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a free, accessible, and pretty intuitive way to learn or practice a language. I learned Italian in university, and Duolingo has been a wonderful way to get back into it years later. The only reason it's 4/5 in my book is how gamified the experience is, with XP, gems, etc. I don't mind some gamification‚ÄîI'm probably not the target audience for it anyway‚Äîbut it's impossible to ignore and grates on me. It's still very, very much worth getting, though."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Maybe I was rushing going through it a bit and didn't see a pop-up explaining where the guidebooks were for each unit (I think I just assumed the notepad was just a picture and nothing more). But once I discovered it, it made it a lot better to learn and you weren't just guessing what some sentence structures mean. I think this feature should be made more obvious. Overall, it's pretty good though."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is amazing when it comes to learning a new language of your choice, however there's a small mistake in hiragana for Japanese. the ""„Çí"" says ""o"" instead of ""wo"""
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They updated the layout which makes tracking your progress and keeping yourself refreshed on certain courses much harder. I dont understand why they needed to change the ui, it was simple and understandable, now it's TOO simple, there are no labels or differences between courses, just one big star to the next. That is not helpful to learning a language, that's how you play a video game."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I think this is the best app for learning new language ......... I'm learning KOREAN on this app and I have completed 1 lesson and now I can read Korean easily....... I also learned the basic words from this app ..... and again the best app for learning any language ....... And I gave it only 4 stars because I had to learn basic conversation in KOREAN language which is not there. But still this app is very good ................ gud ..gud ..gud ... X THANK YOU X
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"very good system, but some of the audio is unclear. however, it's really helping me to learn the language. I wish they would do a Castillian version as there are some differences!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I am learning Chinese,and it is a wonderful app for learning different languages. It covers all 4 skills: Listening, Reading, Speaking, and Writing.. It looses one star because: 1. Some translation into English is incorrect. 2. Some sounds are missing; eg. 'ji' as in jidian-time. I have been sending feedback for months, yet still the problem remains. 3. When you finish 2 quests at the same time, the quests do not register in the monthly total."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It helps you learning the language. But you really need someone to practice speaking. That doesn't work in the app. I learn sentences but I can't have a conversation with someone. And some sentences make no sense. I hate if you misspell a name like Louis/Luis or Sofia/Sophia is marked as a mistake.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The game really has potential and is very good for what it is, but the app said they make learning fun like a game and I'm not really getting that. it's more as if a quest not even a quest game just a 'quest'."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I am almost done with the polish lessons again and there still doesn't seem to be 2000 words yet. Also the monthly challenges are broken and progress stops for seemingly no reason. I am certain that i have done double the quests required to complete the challenge. The app gets less stars if it does not work as intended. When it gets fixed i will update the review. My record of a perfect monthly streak is broken after almost 2 years. I'm still doing daily lessons. Please fix bugs first.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is great! I have already learned the basics of German after two days, which is very fast. I am currently learning two languages and I don't feel stressed in any way, beside the constant death threats..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is a very good platform for language learners where they can easily learn other languages whether they have started learning the language for the first time. I have learnt French and spanish easily on duolingo and now I am able to conversate easily with native French and Spanish people. So, I rate a five star to duolingo ."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I am a paying user. Why, all of a sudden does the app not give me gems but continues to reward me with double points even when I've finished more than requirements and way more time for the day. Is it that you want me to buy gems instead?? Didn't do this to me when I was not paying a monthly fee. I don't socialize in the app, that is NOT why I am here. I prefer to earn the gems as my achievement/reward. There needs to be a way that we can set app to pay out our preferred way"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's improved so much with Mandarin, back to when they hadnt updated their settings it wasn't as good back then as it is now! You are able to write the mandarin characters which is essentially for learning a script/character style language. Very impressed! There's also a feature to learn the tones, I just wish that there was an option for this to be a little more interactive"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"All those gems & rewards are complete nonsense. Having to pick ""continue"" 3 or 4 times just to get to the next lesson is irritating Why can't I just turn all that trash off? It's quicker to quit the app & restart + No option to use offline even with subscription"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"4/5, I'd rate the app higher though having to deal with the hearts is a bit annoying. When learning a new skill whether it be a language or anything else, making mistakes is common. Though being locked out and having to either wait for your ""lives"" to refill is tedious and leads to burn out or frustration. I know there are ways to replenish them faster but those aren't really worth the payoff when a lesson or two later a simple mistake could cause you to repeat the process again."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am finding Duolingo to be absolutely fabulous,I have chosen to learn Turkish, I am a beginner, I am currently 10 days into the first unit, and I am actually starting to read, spell, understand and speak simple everyday sentences in Turkish, I am really excited about how fast I have got to this stage, when I first started, I couldn't even pronounce one Turkish word, I am currently using the free trial, and I can honisty say now, that I will happily become a payed user of this Duolingo üíØ"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"sometimes the app doesn't offer the strictly correct, literal translation as an option. it really isn't the correct answer, especially with verbs ending in ing."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Some people think this app competes with other language learning apps; it doesn't. It competes for your attention with all those other stupid, mindless things we do when we're waiting in line, or riding the bus. Those 10-minute ""filler"" moments we use our phone to keep us from having to stand/sit there with ""nothing "" to do. It competes with those things well. I don't know if it could take you to ""fluency "" but it sure can help, and it DEFINITELY keeps me motivated to keep going!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have been using duolingo for 3 weeks now and find it easy to use. I have opted for the paid version, which in the UK is ¬£60 for a year, good value. One improvement that could be made is to have a dictionary of words that you have learnt so far that builds as you learn news words. This would allow you to review certain words without having to go back to the lesson it was presented in."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"First and foremost I definitely would recommend this language learning game for anyone interested in learning languages, since it comes with a generous array of languages and gamifies starting to learn a new language, though I definitely do recommend doing more writing and talking practice outside of the game, since it relies heavily on multiple choice. I do sort of miss the old design of the achievements page, since I liked knowing how much I still had left to reach my next achievement."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The personal practice lessons are stuck on repeat, and I keep getting the same lessons over and over again. It's very frustrating."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Amazing. l am enjoying every bit of the Spanish tutorial from Duolingo as it is very very simple to understand and well explained for easy recall. l encourage anyone willing to learn Spanish Language to use Duolingo
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"i find it as a very helpful language learning app! however, sometimes i feel it takes things too low. Maybe a section to practice specifically words you want to know or maybe just words you overall need practice one, and my favorite thing of all on duolingo are the streaks! they always help you keep track on how long you practice for, amd freeze streaks if you miss a day or 2, Also the owl(duo)."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love Duolingo!!! My Spanish is definitely improving! I have a lot of Spanish speakers at my school üè´ & I am so happy that I can speak some Spanish words with them! I prefer regular Duo over Super Duo because I don't make as many mistakes & I learn more.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great service, brilliant approach. I am learning with my limits in a satisfactory way. In a few cases i had the exercise not working, but it can be reporter and mended it. My first language was french,then Italian, then English, and some adventure with Navajo. it is entertaining and if you pay a little, is really fast. I recommend it without restraint or bias."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is a must have. Even if you don't want to learn another language, get it and learn one. It's almost easy they're so good. Edit: I pay the subscription which I'm happy to do, but I wish they would not push microtransactions on me to boot. There's a little too much fluff in between lessons. I just want to learn the language!!! I don't care about XP and all that jazz. I really like the word association feature! I'd like a feature to work endings. In Latin Scio, I..scitis you. Etc."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a cute app and does a good job of gamifying language learning. Spaced repetition works well to learn vocabulary, though grammar could use actual explanations sometimes. Ads are very intrusive and each lesson comes with multiple pages of junk to click through. Often faster to force quit the app and restart it rather than wait through ads, meaningless rewards, and so on. For a much better flashcard app, I recommend Anki."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I jumped on board over a year ago because we had traveled to go scuba dive and was done having a language barrier. I like Duo better because it goes into all pretenses. I find that I'm able to have more conversations that are current in the language rather than just one line sentences. I did the free version, and I'm happy with it. Now that I have been over a year and know I'm invested, I may purchase the duolingo super. I'll update if I do."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Oh dear, this snake path feels more like a random jumble. If you used filtering with tags it might help personalise the experience. Now 06/23 so glitchy, 09/23 gets stuck on launch at the splash screen, useless. Now 1/10 lost my falling star in my profile, all the other options are ugly! When you accidentally tap on a notification to find a xp boost it applies immediately automatically without asking, so wasting a gift when closing the app! Now ignoring XP boosts when applied, great!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"it's a pretty good app. I've learned mostly just the sounds of most characters and not many actually words, it's still mostly effective and would recommend for the most part."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Bad bad bad. Makes me do lessons all day to get gems, only to lose it for no reason after an AD has a fake exit button and spamming it I exit the legendary challenge, losing 100 gems in the process that took a week to earn. And no, I'm not paying extra for super, on an app that clearly is only for profit now, not learning. Used to be great, free lessons to learn a language. Now there's so many ads it's better to use a sketchy website. TLDR: used to be good, now is either expensive or too slow."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Really fantastic way to learn a language.... 100 % good to children also 9.3.2024 From yesterday... Duolingo app not working.. Even after my Data is on... The app says I am offline.. I couldn't complete my streak and quest for past 2days
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app really boosted my metabolism and it also let me learn in a very fun way. The streak makes me want to learn. The way it works almost makes it feel like a video game. The ads are not very annoying either and they are mostly skippable. Another thing about the ads is that duolingo's ads themselves are very fun to watch, which is very uncommon in my case. There are many ways to use super without paying if you do well and it just helps me a lot. A truly amazing app if you ask me!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very good, really enjoying the tesching method which I doubted. Am slowly learning a new language which is a big challenge for someone whose not too bright!"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"good starting point, before using a tutor or having a conversation with fluent speaker. reminders are nice but can be annoying if you don't like being told what to do."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Duolingo and only have one suggestion for the developers. I wish there was an option to opt out of using streak freezes. I want my steak to reflect my real steak so if I ever miss a day, I skip on purpose until the steak freezes are gone and my streak resets. I am sure they help some people keep from losing momentum, but to me, they are demotivating."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I use duloingo daily and it's ùó≤ùòÖùó∞ùó≤ùóπùóπùó≤ùóªùòÅ. I have no problems, but I come with a recommendation. You know how there are only 2 streaks freezes currently available to collect? Sometimes, you may go on holiday and not have access to WiFi; so you'd loose your streak freezes and your streak.It's utterly heartbreaking and horrible to see your 500 day streak waste because of a simple trip with no WiFi. So I suggest that maybe, to not push it, allowing people to collect 4 streak freezes or 5."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very good game, it's just when you are introduced to a new word sentence or phrase for any language, you should be told what the sentence means or word/phrase means, beacuse from my experience I sometimes have to guess beacuse it's a new word/phrase/sentence and I loose life's and I can't afford Super at the moment but yes I think the game should tell you what the word sentence or phrase means."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the app after having a break for a few months, it's surprising how much I've remembered going back in. The only problem is ads blaring full blast at random intervals especially when your phone is turned all the way up you can't anticipate it as you might go 5-10 minutes without an ad then prepare to have your ears cleared out by another zombie survival ad."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"OK for some aspects, but no communication with humans is very limiting. Better for new writing systems than whole languages? Bad goal design leads to postponing certain lessons. 3* I've recently been subjected to loud, fullscreen, motion-heavy ads after virtually every lesson. I usually keep my phone muted to avoid such interruptions but need sound for listening lessons. I have animations disabled in the app but still they play. With each ad, I'm less inclined to sub, more to uninstall. -2*"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used Duolingo years ago, paid for it to avoid the ads but eventually stopped using it because it's just so bad. Figured I should check it out again to see if it improved over the years. It did not, it got worse. All you need to know is that they prioritize serving you as many ads as possible and luring you in with dark patterns, learning comes dead last. I highly question their statistics about the effectiveness of this app. Categorizing it as ""education"" is disingenuous at best."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo doesn't make you do too much if you don't want. It helps you learn a language with a little fun. For some reason, I really enjoy the short stories and I actually understand them."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app used to be fun until recently. The ""ramp up challenges"" are impossible, they have long winded sentences at my level and they're throwing words at me I don't know. I'm wasting all my ""gems"" (that have mysteriously dropped a significant amount) buying timer boosts due to the sentences being hyper long and the ""instructors"" talking so slow. This app used to be fun, now it's just irritating & far too challenging to even complete a simple lesson. :/"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm learning the hiragana alphabet (Japanese) with duolingo, and its going great. ads are few and far between, and I feel motivated after a lesson. definitely worth your time if you want to learn a new language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Hery helpful app in learning a language, however, there seems to be nothing done with the feedback I provide on specific excercises. I would rather see the quality of the content being improved rather than the UI. Also, forums for specific excercises were taken away, promising an ""AI"" powered assistant, but that is still not available after months so there is nowhere to go with my doubts and questions."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"great app for learning languages, however my account got hacked somehow (i saw new languages appear with arabic as the base language wich i dont speak) and they started liberally using my hard earned gems.. there's no way to contact duolingo in regards to this wich killed my motivation to keep using the app but recently that came back after a couple years, here's hoping it doesn't happen again"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Early stages of use, but enjoying using the app. Pace seems to be appropriate too. Update: since last using it there's a lot more adverts and they've introduced a hearts system to encourage you to purchase more ""lives"". I eventually gave up as it became so frustrating waiting ages for the same adverts, which I've no interest in and which appear over and over again, to disappear."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,there's no way to progress or keep your work for that day if you're like me and have severe learning disability (in the free version). it kicks you once you get too many things wrong and then doesn't even count that you signed on.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've learned a lot of expressions but little understanding of grammar. Words I've learned are intensely focused on for a while and then not for a long time, which doesn't help with retention. Mini games will give you simple one word questions on a clock and then suddenly hit you with a twelve word phrase that kills your time, obviously intending for you to buy more time. A little under handed. Has kept me on program for almost a year at least!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The first two or three exercises are helpful and sensible, useful to learn. But after that 2 or 3, it's a mess. It expects you to know the meaning of words you were not previously exposed to, to know sentences with words you were never taught. They jump from 1st to 10th gear. Not a recommended ""language learning"" app. If you don't already know the language, this app is just going to irritate you."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Learning languages made easy with Duolingo, their ways of introducing you to the language you want to learn is awesome. As you progress through the stages, you see review questions on previous lessons. The best part is that you can learn any language for absolutely free because subscription is optional and doesn't deter your learning. I will recommend Duolingo to anyone, anytime, and any day."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Before it started to be everything with ""russian pilot says"" everything was good. Now, I 3 day wrote about this stuff, nothing change. If it still will be I will find another app. I don't want to hear anything about this country!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I think you should add a loader when user open the app. It's bit confusing that app is loading content due to internet issue or app stopped due to something else. Otherwise it's fine
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm really grateful to have an app that I can use for free to learn so many different languages. There is a really wide selection and a great reward system to motivate you to practice every day. I do miss some explanations on grammar though. And another thing that could be improved: I have been studying for almost a month and I still don't know how to say ""Where is the bus station?"" But instead, we learn sentences like ""The monkey reads small words""? Why?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have been using this app for a few years now. I had to get a new phone and I can't use the app because it says it has a bug. It keeps shutting down automatically before I can even access a lesson
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They have completely ruined what was once a great app. Very glitchy to the point that it has become frustratingly unusable. Who ever took the app over has ruined it. I would even pay to use it, but not until they fix it. Stay away until then. You will know by the comments if that ever happens."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've learnt a lot of French words and phrases through this app. I can relatively read some sentences in French language. Now, the loading is slow. It's discouraging. Please, work on it. Also, you game is a fraud. You designed it to favour you. You slowly release the similar words even after clicking on it. Be transparent and let players win on merit. Your matching madness is fraudulent."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Now that I've tried apps like Lingolegend, Duolingo just feels stale. I still return to it because it is familiar, but it no longer feels rewarding. The ""streak"" system is more demoralizing than anything else and the rigid path system is so boring! Having no freedom to choose topics is the biggest weakness of this app for sure. I'm hoping they take the advice of many reviews."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Been using duolingo to help learn Spanish and German for a couple of years now. I enjoy the quickness of the lessons as it can be done in small-time windows and the fact the extensiveness of the vocabulary. What I don't like is how fast the phrases are sometimes read to you at. They have a slow speak but then it's PAINFULLY slow. It seems you have to either choose between a speed reader speaking a sentence or someone who can speak like 30 wpm. I really hope they add a middle ground one. . .
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Absolutely love the app! Love competing against others. Definitely the best way to learn a new language both by speaking it and writing it! Very impressive. The only reason I haven't given it full stars is because there's no option to pay monthly. So many apps want a high amount in one go. I wouldn't mind paying for it monthly if that was ever another option.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is an amazing app, and I've learned so much. I'm honestly able to read and understand real-world banners and signs. However, my only downfall is that I had to get the subscription for it. the unlimited tries and unlocked practices really helped me. I'm on a 90-day streak cause of it But, it would not have been possible without yhe subscription or a really good no loss streak Thank You"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app but still can improve. Something strange is happening in the second chapter of the Mandarin course, I sometimes finish a lesson and it does not count... Or this annoying situation when you updated the course and I needed to skip two whole units to not repeat them. And yes when I was doing these ""extra hard"" skipping tests one of them did not count and I had to do it 2 times. Some characters in Mandarin don't have sounds when read alone. And I think that unlocking themes would be cool."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Since the last installation package update failed, the program can not use any oral practice. I have tried various methods to recover including re-downloading, setting up the authorized microphone inside, giving full access and so on have failed. I contacted customer service to try to get them to solve the problem, but no one answered. I've been practicing for nearly 100 days, but it's disappointing that I can't solve this system problem"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Really like the app overall but would've loved to have more languages to choose from that you speak. For example, Romanian and a lot more. What about the people that already speak listen learning languages but have so few options to choose from? While I do speak and know English very well, it is very difficult trying to learn a non Germanic language (Latin based eg Spanish Italian French) from English due to many grammar and phrasing differences. Thus I feel like my progress is insignificant."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo knows how to motivate learners with fun graphics, points, challenges, and friend quests. It is fast-paced and repeats words and phrases, making learning attainable. My complaints: Audio has been consistently missing for one word. I have also experienced a lag in processing and some errors accepting speaking, which has caused me to fail certain lessons. This hasn't affected my learning, so it is a small complaint, but enough to take off a star."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This information is organized, and easy to learn. It combines audio, visual and analytical skills catering for the varied types of learners. I absolutely love it"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Random ad audios play when starting a new lesson. It plays over the lesson audio and won't shut off unless you close the app. Very frustrating. Lessons completions are stalling, forcing me to close the app to get to the next lesson. The lesson counts as completed, but if it was the final lesson, you don't receive your 2x XP chest or if it was a perfect lesson, it doesn't count toward your goals."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's a good jump start to learn a new language. I don't like that it's not more interactive to answer questions. I feel I need to take an in person class to really understand what I don't understand in learning the grammar of the language.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app keeps getting worse. The voices sound more synthetic over time, and as I progress my learning in school, it is less and less capable of understanding what I say. It used to be so much better."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It has helped me with vocabulary, but the lessons move too quickly and I would like more chances to go over them. Still better than the 2 years of college Russian I took."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's is one of my favorite language learning apps. It's very engaging and competitive which is the part I like the most because I am competitive. And it has a streak that helps you come back every day & learn your language which really helps inconsistent ppl like me very well. And you can also follow your friends & encourage each other when you pass important mile stones. And you can discuss the question when you press the message thingy. And above all else It is free. So yes Download it Rn.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Fun but no real teaching or lessons. It is based on units for practice with tips scattered within. No opportunity to ask ""Why"", and grammar rules are scarce. Scoring is inconsistent. After completing an Early Bird or Night Owl chest the app indicates double XP for 15 minutes, but often it scores incorrectly. Timed sessions are too short and often impossible to complete without a power booster. Often booster is needed on the very last task. It takes time to earn enough points to get free booster"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Utter waste of time. It is childish and unstructured. You are a pair of eyes for adverts essentially. Not enough focus on verbs. So called AI is clearly not paying attention.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is an amazing app as it has helped me learn both Japanese and Swedish at the same time. It covers a lot of bases and sure there are ads but not so much you have to throw your phone. There are listening (optional), speaking (optional), reading and writing ways to learn. The only downside is that there are a few updates needed and sometimes it glitches like once it gave unlimited hearts for no reason. There are a few bugs. That's my review hope this helps."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I am using it for Spanish and Chinese. It is pretty good, however exercises used to have links to the relevant discussions, and they've removed them. Also, there's no traditional Chinese option."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm learning at my own pace, which is pretty slow...BUT I have certainly made more effort than I would with other learning programmes. This is down to the little reminders and the fact the app seems to have the perfect algorithm. I feel sometimes feel I'm getting a little far ahead of where I need to be, then the app reverts my learning back to the basics for a short while to help me re-learn the previous chapters before I move on the the more complicated subjects. I'm a monthly subscriber."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app could be amazing and great. If it were improved, I would consider paying. However, I am disappointed. Unfortunately, many of the sentences are honestly ridiculous. ""My bear is in the theatre now."" I mean, seriously?? Why not have sentences that actually would be useful. Maybe the more humorous ones are ok, but most are just stupid and off-putting. Also, there are issues with no proper explanations of where you went wrong, especially with the plurals, without having to pay $$ ongoing."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The lessons and translations have gotten worse over the last couple months. My partner is from a different country and I'm trying to learn their language. Unfortunately they keep having to correct things I learned from duo.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"in terms of learning it's very repetitive which is good for memorising things but gets very boring very quickly. the system does not adapt well to the individuals progress either. the listening exercises are totally pointless as the system just says a word and you have to choose the phonetic spelling. This is not learning of any kind, a child could do it and it is of no benefit in any language. I got 100% in every listening exercise and yet they keep coming up. improvements needed to this app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Duolingo for a few years, and it's okay at teaching you conjugation and lexicon ‚Äì but I honestly can't trust it to do it correctly, even as I am only learning european languages through English-version app, I'm sure it's worse for others. Generated sentences became less helpful and more like filler. The actual explanation should show up at the start of a unit, even if with a skip option, and I preferred when it had at least simplified explanations of rules, not just examples..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is a complete mess...It is great at the surface level, but I have no idea where I went wrong. It doesnt explain concepts, nor does it accept answers that have completely the same meaning as the 'proper way'. + now that they have split the welsh course into sections of 'traveller, begginer, e.c.t', it feels like I am not able to progress... Update 13/10/23: Although most of these problems are still present, the app has gotten more fluent and greater over time"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great for learning basics, but games and challenges can become more difficult and there is never enough time for the challenge so it knocks your confidence in learning your chosen language! Don't sign up for free trial of super duolingo as if the time passes and you forget about it they charge you 90 euro and they do not give refunds at all ! Also they don't really explain about punctuation etc, you have to go looking for that info yourself! But I am sticking with it as I need to learn Spanish."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I like the authentic speakers and attention to pronunciation. It can supplement a language course but it doesn't really replace one or immersion.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,a good variety of learning strategies. wish I could go back and repeat/review though - the Android app doesn't seem to have this function
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm learning Korean, & though there's a lot of great things about this app, it's frustrating when I believe I'm pronouncing something correct, but there is no phonetic example to know why my pronunciation ""sounds a bit off,"" or ""not quite right"" For crying it out it claimed that I didn't say Tea correctly. How do you mess that one up? Also, every so often the sound doesn't work when you're supposed identify what is being said, and the volume button doesn't work to repeat it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The section 3 of the Cantonese, which is the review course section after finishing the language. It always always give the very very similar courses and can not cover all the sessions, I think this kind of review coursr can not make sense. The review should totally random all the course of the language. Not just let me see the very similar courses day by day!!!!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"One of the best learning platforms that exists. it makes learning a new language so fun and addictive. The app is hustle-free and no down times at all. I've never experienced any technicalities. Super easy, smooth paced. And being notified that someone took your spot or has congratulated you boosts your morale to keep at it. And the best part is that it's paired with a podcast to deepen your understanding of the new language. Love it, Highly recommend it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The ads drive me nuts. There's no way you can stop them without paying. When you've practiced you click on continue to do more exercises an ad plays. Really frustrating? !!!!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It used to be good, but now it feels like one of those lame social media games instead of a learning tool. Going back to review past lessons doesn't even seem like a possibility now. It just wants you to ding achievements and push you forward regardless of whether you learned anything or not. The ads are also a bit annoying and overly long. I would rather have a paid app (which they might have, but I haven't seen it yet)."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I'd rate it a 2.5 but I guess there is some usefulness to be found from the app. Layout overall is pretty nice. Very user friendly and easy to navigate (apart from some glitches...typically). I'm learning Japanese right now and all I can say is definitely DO NOT use this app as your only resources for learning especially if going for fluency. Alot of inaccurate and odd/unnatural translations for both English and Japanese also proven from many native speakers who've reviewed the app for accuracy!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this teaching game I've always wanted to learn Spanish it actually helped me soo much. doulingo can help you with any language you could now it in like 5 or more or less this app is soo helpful.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is awesome linguistics app. The only negative is in the German content, unit one where sounds are asked but the meaning is not given. Aside from that small issue, it really is a helpful app and I love that it's free. Moreover, the structure of the app, where its made to feel like a game is fantastic to keep people interested. 4.7 stars"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I am enjoying studying Spanish immensely! I would like to have real conversations in the real world to practice what I have learned. I need to feel more confident or maybe feel more comfortable making many mistakes in person. I like the format but sometimes the program gets stuck and that is frustrating. This is more fun than crossword puzzles and Scrabble for me.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app needs one particular thing to keep people ok track ... It needs a section that records all of the words a learner has learnt so that they can go back to this to help freshen their memory or when they are trying to have a conversation but get stuck on a certain word. I know it would help me massively to have all of the words I've learnt in one section on the app as I don't always remember the words I've learnt and I forget. Please add this feature especially for super Duolingo users
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is really awesome to learn a new language. The best part is it keeps on reminding you about taking lessons and care about your lessons like someone close to you would khehe.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used this app a lot in the past. Even now it is a good way to refresh languages that have been studied before, as well as introducing new languages. What's more is that rarer languages are offered that aren't given with other apps. The main flaw is from the life system. The app originally allowed for pass or fail but play as much as you want. I understand the need to push for premium but if ads ""keep learning free"", there should not be deterrents from using the app."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best learning app ever, i love it. Sadly, there's not much languages to learn, or you know, set as the settings. Only famous languages. It's great, it even has a ""Can't listen right now"" Option. I love how the creator and the employees put such hardwork into this. Definitely recommended if you're going to another country or want to learn a language for fun, studies, anything. Good app, i love it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The free option is good, but upgrading to Super is well worth it. I use Duolingo to supplement my learning. It ensures I do a little every day, even I only have time to do the minimum to keep my streak. Having said that, once I do one lesson I usually end up doing more so this is a great way to encourage daily practice. The stories in the podcasts are enjoyable too. I highly recommend Duolingo."

Only suggestion is that for complex courses like Japanese and Hindi, for the alphabets and letters, their should be a separate option to learn those symbols by drawing them in a different exercise to train the memory. Currently only the letters and pronunciations are given. Otherwise great app, keep it up guys"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like the pace that it takes, but after a while I wish that you could choose a game of some sorts to keep your mind busy. I also would like for the test to see where you are in the language would be available more than one time for those who have been learning outside of Duolingo, and advances there skills farther than the course they lefts off on."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a fun way to learn a language, or at least get started, however it seems lacking in terms of teaching proper grammar. There's many occasions where I don't understand the ""why"" behind the structure of each sentence, and I have to search the Internet for an explanation. I would like if leagues could be turned off. They are motivating at first but after awhile I focused more on earning points rather than actually learning."

I love the fact that Duolingo challenges you in listening, writing, speaking, and reading in different ways. they're the same group of ways to interact with the app but this is good as it allows for predictably which helps me memorize languages easier. and then the sheer number of languages available is incredible. good job Duolingo!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's pretty fun for learning Japanese hiragana and katakana so far. I do combine it with outside resources and some analog note-taking since the app doesn't have a word bank for learned vocabulary(at least when learning hiragana/katakana). I'm also using it to help refresh my Spanish since my accent and pronunciation need work. Overall, it's really fun to get started into learning a new language, but I highly recommend looking for other resources to go along with it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"A relatively expensive platform for the quality and extent of learning you can cover every month for the money. You will be able to say a few things but you need more resources. Considering that- it is very expensive when there are free video lessons and podcasts available that cover far more in detail. This is repetitive, conversational language learning. It does not cover grammar basics, conjugation, gender based language elements, unique letters, foundational introductions etc."

For Chinese you can't turn off pinyin, at least as of yet if there is an option. I don't want to use pinyin I want to work on my character memorization. The first couple of lessons are pretty worthless and just repeat themselves over and over. The app hangs at the end of lessons a lot. So I'm constantly closing the app to continue doing lessons."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's very fun to use it I think that I am playing a game and it's really really a game . When I used it first time that I realize that yes i am learning something . I don't face any problem in it and yes it's a learning game. And i face so many problems in other apps than my friend tell me about this app because she also use this app and now we are in same position, same level, and same unit but i am in section 1 rookie and it is so fun lily, zari, duo and so on that's why I love this üòäüòä game"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm on streak 70 today, Duo lingo helped me a lot. It's a great app, always reminding me to learn a lesson. Got fewer ads... At this point you can say that it got no ads at all. It's free and interactive. I don't know what they benefit with teaching free lessons. Overall, it's a great app to learn a language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Everything's great except for that stupid robotic voice.. it either talk so fast that the words overlap each other or gives you an option for slower which is nice on some of it but most of it the voice is so fast that if you're trying to learn it doesn't give you an option to slow down all the voices that are talkin to you so complete sentences completely overlap so fast you can't even tell what is said ..
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Poor customer service. Overall it's a good language learning experience. The app has problems that could easily be fixed for a better experience however the company is reluctant to make changes. Too many problems too much time spent writing a low responsive CS. The company is making far too much money to be concerned about customer experience. I have had some both responses & inadvertent purchases refunded but for the most part they don't want to be bothered. Most problems remain unsatisfied.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Good stuff. Not perfect, but close, and it's free! Lessons are fun and laid out well. Most lessons can be completed in two-to-five minutes. There are a few very minor beefs I have (for instance, native Spanish rarely use nominative pronouns, but DuoLingo uses them), but for the price (free), you'd be hard-pressed to imagine, much less find, a smoother, more enjoyable, easier-to-use learning program. One statement about their content: some examples feature people in all kinds of romantic sit"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hands down The best language learning app! Kudos to team Duo! Makes my self learning so much easier! It's my sixth language I'm learning currently, and duo just gets better with each update! Thankyou for being my language partner!ü•≥"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new match game is stressful. Enough to stress in the world as it it is. Don't need stress from an app. The game is scaled to force to get upgrades, designed for youn'uns with lighting reflexes and. I will be requesting a refund as it was the biggest reason to upgrade to not having to watch ads in league lighting rounds. I can't deny that I have learned the language of my choice using the app. I did enjoy competing in the league every now and then."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Since the last update, the colours are super bright and it really make tired my eyes, these are kind of psychedelic colours! Not to mention the abusive use of adds (not willing to pay tbh) Also it doesn't make sense the silly examples and make me doubt of the actual sense of the exercise (which sometimes I fail cos it just doesn'tmake sense!). Im doing Italian btw. If this is run by AI still is not good... get native ppl to the language to work on this App. Cheers"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the app an the option to learn more than one language. The only problem is sometimes i cant get into the app, but overall its an amazing app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been with Duo for about 4 years but I hate the recent format change. Its not working for me. On the tree format I was constantly progressing. Yes, it was repetitive but I needed that to grind it into my brain. On the new format I am not. I get moved on too soon. Now I'm discouraged and looking for an alternative. UPDATE 10/13/2023 I'm done. I hate the app now! I can't stand it!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm a visual learner so having pictures sometimes instead of just words is helpful. I like the change in style between listening, writing, seeing, or speaking"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's a great app. I so much enjoy learning through fun. I have been learning Italian since last August and I think it's a must to use Duolingo if you want to combine learning through fun. I recommend it undoubtedly. Gracie mille Duolingo!!!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This new version sucks and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. This app was way better when it was completely free now they want you to pay for every advantage for little to no actual useful lessons that are applicable in real world conversations. The league system, rewards, scoring and leaderboards also such as learning a language shouldn't be a competition. I would recommend finding other apps or ways to learn your desired language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The original version was very user friendly allow the learner to progress at their own pace and also track their progress. Learning should not be a competitive. I state this fact as a retired secondary school teacher and former youth worker. The new version forces learners forward before actual proficiency is achieved, resulting in knowledge gaps as well as undermining the enjoyment of learning. Learning is a life long task and should not be coercive. It's not a game of winners and losers."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is the best application for leaning new language! I can learn many languages nowadays! I can improve my language by using this application. Duolingo helps me a lot. I love it.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I really like the app but lately it uses words I haven't learned in challenges and so on (from the next chapters). It's pretty annoying (especially in like the ramp up challenge and so on).
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I really like it. I have had it for two days and I already know almost 30 words and phrases.I like how u get hearts by practicing it kinda helps and there aren't to many ads there is still ads but the way it works is kinda confusing but I still really like
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Would give a better rating if the practice your words section worked! I've got so many words there to practice but every time I load it, nothing happens and it comes up with an error message. Great learning tool and if you're mega serious about learning a language, the paid subscription is worth it but feels like I'm missing out on a huge chunk of learning by not being able to access the words section due to some unknown error!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It works OK as a learning option. Basically an average teacher. It's engaging and easy enough to use when you have little breaks in the day. However it's is basically learning through repetition, there's very little explanation as to why or how a different language works the way it does. It's learning via bashing your head against a wall at times It also glitches out the sound on your phone every 5 or 6 times one of their weird characters speaks and you can't fix that. I've reported it...."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It is amazing to learn new languages. i have started learning German. The learning process is fun and like game playing . The good thing is that Duolingo free resources are good enough to fairly learn a language. The app is flawless üëçüëçüëç I am now planning to purchase subscription. Thanks Duolingo.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Overall okay but is very repetitive and gives too much importance to streaks, chests and gems, I'm not here to play but to learn so I eventually deactivated all notifications. Sick of the match madness ""minigame"" as well, it's been on all the time for the past month when before it would alternate between two others, more variety would be greatly appreciated but it appears repetition is the only way forward in this ""game""."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,At first I liked duo alot. But now it seems to rush me. It introduces words way to fast and it doesn't give me time to continue to work on words from the past. You can still work on past lessons but the questions don't vary and it doesn't really give you hard questions but really easy ones that don't test your knowledge or help improve it. It rushes you and its kind of annoying now. Its like looking at a algebra problem. I don't even feel like doing lessons now.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Most definitely one of the best learning apps ever! It has a great pace at which it provides lots of rewards, encouragement and motivation to keep learning a language or even multiple languages simultaneously. My kids are learning more than in their current language class and have been keeping up easily with their instructors. The most intriguing aspect of this app is seeing how my family looks forward to learning due to the fun nature of the app and the ""learn at your own pace"" it provides."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They keep changing the structure of the French course. It is frustrating. Just when you think you are making some progress, they change/update the course again. It is almost like they cannot decide how to structure the course, so they do a trial-and-error. I wouldn't pay a single dime to subscribe to this app. I am only milking it to do simple revision. Even if it removes the free-to-use feature, it won't be missed. There are many other better apps out there that i am considering subscribing to."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Dear sir/madam! For the second week i've been experiencing a strange problem. At the end of each week the results are shown And you have to continue to start to compete in a new leaderboard. I stopped to see my position in the board, what zone i am in. It simply shows me what was my position in the previous leaderboard and that is. It should be a technical error. I ask to check and fix it. Victoria"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good, but the hearts system is annoying. In my opinion, it just prevents you from getting better at a language quickly. Please remove it/add an option to disable it (I know Super Duolingo exists, but learning a language should be free and not limited by a hearts system). Your mission includes 'Making learning fun' and 'Universally accessible'; being unable to continue&correct a mistake(except if you pay) is neither of those. (Practice to earn hearts makes progress slow;you learn thru mistakes)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's ok if you are reinforcing your knowledge of a language that you learn from another source, but it's terrible for starting out with a language. The limitation on MISTAKES at a beginner level is so ridiculous-- not to mention the frequent bugs with the wrong audio playing which CAUSES said mistakes. There are better options out there."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is the best app to learn new languages. Very easy to use. All the things about Duolingo is good. But is would be great if the user can communication with other people who are learning the same language. It will help the user to improve more in the language which is they are learning. If the user can chat in the language the user learning it will help the user to improve more in the language the user learning.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's good but can be better to avoid competition and increase AI as students progress faster. The family plan gifting is not working as the end user's browser is launched instead of plan assigned to correct MIME type.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Scattered and irrelevant vocab, annoying and counterproductive repetition, constantly changing the pathway = inconsistent and boring. I have been a solid user for about two years and I use it now ONLY because it's free. I was a paid subscriber until they took away user choice pathways, but the new inflexible routine is a deep regression. Why put so much work into animations but not allow the user to work where and how I want within the system? The old version (2022) was infinitely superior."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,this app is a great tool and easy to learn most languages. the lessons are simple and really teaches the basics to advanced. I definitely recommend.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,i was hoping this would help with the basics of what you'd like to do when going to Italy. like hi how are you. can I have a coffee please. but goes into random stuff like she is tall. I have an American neighbor. the books also have no association to the words you've covered. in that level. all in all ok but would rather it cover things for visiting italy before it went on to the more day to day things if you were actually living there
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a great language learning app! My only complaints are that the adds seam far worse than they did 8 years ago when I first used the app. It's also a little too repetitive!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Recently, the ads have been very annoying. They have always been much louder than the actual lessons, but I was able to turn the volume down or use the mute button when there was one. But now, this rarely works. Most ads can't be muted and even the phone's volume button doesn't turn them down. I can't even use earbuds to use Duolingo anymore because the ads will damage my hearing. The app itself it great, but these ads need to be fixed."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I've had Duolingo since 2013. But today I found out that they fired a bunch of their translators in favor of AI. And the people they kept are only there to verify the AI translations are correct. I deleted my account and the app the instant I found out about this. I'm not going to support a company that chooses profit over people.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Fun but at times frustrating just from learning a new language, enjoying the experience and the leaderboards. Just the right level of gameification."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is polished and easy to use, but at it's core it just doesn't work. Maybe for simpler languages it could, but mostly it just throws words at you and says good luck on deciphering tenses and grammar. They used to have proper lessons but removed them to further gameify the app with a bunch of annoyances designed to guilt and coerce you into spending more time on it. If you already know a language, it might help keep it fresh, but no one is becoming fluent from this Skinner box."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A very useful tool for basic language learning. I learned Spanish in an efficient way here. It does have some ads, though. So, if you are using the free version, it will limit some of the facilities it provides with limited hearts and less practice options. But, it is still a great app for languages with great animation and very interactive method of learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,There is a glitch.. when I am following someone it shows their profile in my following list but when I refresh the app they were no longer in my following list.. I mean I can't follow any people it says that some error occurs and try again.. please fix it Duolingo and I will edit the post ..And thank you
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After the most recent change to the Italian course a lot of my progress was deleted again. I skipped forward, but now the daily practices I get are the same things over and over and represent a fraction of the total course. For weeks I haven't had any lessons on the difficult tenses that I use duo to stay familiar with. I'll give it a couple more weeks, but after that I think I'll just move on."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I really like how you can do almost everything for free but you still have the option to purchase super Duolingo. Also love how you can study a lot of courses at the same time for free as well.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app so much. My therapists helped me find to help me learn Spanish and work on it with me. It's fun and easy to use. I wanted to learn Spanish since I was a little girl and now I finally am. If I ever become an adoptive mom my kids will have Doulingo too and I'll recommend you to anyone else looking to learn a new language
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"the pacing for someone more serious about learning a language (at least for Spanish) seems a bit slow (you are able to skip ahead to future chapters, but will miss some things). also I wish they would have a master list of vocabulary words that you could study that updates with the words you learn as you go. I essentially have to rely on other apps for pure vocabulary practice. all in all it is a great tool to have to learn and I do enjoy it thoroughly."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I majored in Spanish in high school 40+ years ago, and this program has allowed me to recall everything I learned decades ago and even more! My granddaughter is taking Spanish in school now, so this is allowing us to interact with each other on a whole different level! I love it!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great app to spend time learning a language. Only real complaint is the speaking exercises seem to pick up background noise better than your own voice
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I am learning Korean and some options are missing (Duo Radio and Storytime). I hope we get those soon. I would like the practice words to be better randomized- I seem to be tested on the same 100 words all the time (out of 500+). Also, I wish there was an option to practice spelling words and I wish there were a few proper lessons on grammar. Otherwise the app is phenomenal."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've attempted to learn languages in the past but lost interest quite quickly. Duolingo helps you keep at it and keep coming back by making it more like a game. The paid feature has useful extras if you're eager to maximise your learning. But the free version is really good and useful on its own, without lacking the key things you need to learn a language. Good job!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app but I've been using for almost 2 years now, they just recently changed their design and there's alot I like about that, but there is one downfall to me. I miss the old leveling method where you can master a legendary method but eventually it ""cracks"" and you have to go back and practice to refresh your memory. That old part before the change really helped me remember older lessons and I wish that was brought back. It is was easier navigate before and fast to study certain topics."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Used to be a very nice way to learn a bit of a new language, but nowadays they restructure the pathway so often it's really confusing and annoying getting things you've already done or be expected to know things you've never been taught. Also the discussion forum was super useful for extra explanation but they removed it... the idea of the app is great but it has many flaws."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app for keeping a proficiency in a language. It's a bit difficult if you're trying to learn a language from scratch, but it is very comprehensive and thorough."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,My spanish improved a lot in just a few weeks. I highly suggest the developers put in more Asian languages like Thai and Tagalog considering that Vietnamese is already inside? Also why isnt Thai inside but Vietnamese is? Thai is way easier to learn than Vietnamese but yet its not inside! Bias!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love learning English at Duolingo, but some of examples are not proper for me. And absolutely this is not FREE app as far as I know. If you want to go forward you need to buy this app by paying."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy learning. a bit stressful, I'm very chill. sad that you can't achieve fluency with the app. It's still a lot of fun to do with friends."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is honestly a good app. Teaches you languages more quick and it is also free. (mostly). But my main concern is the fact that it keeps on glitching. It isn't very helpful that you have a limited amount of hearts. Maybe you should try to improve that. Although, it does pick it's moments, Duolingo is the best by far language learning app!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Over all love the app. It's fun and I've learned and retained a lot more than other methods. I have only one complaint - I think it's completely unfair that the people who don't pay, compete against the people who do pay, for the same leaderboard spots. The point of how nice the paid for benefits are becomes very clear. I've seen score differences that are pointless to try to beat... unless you pay. I think it's a real underhanded enticement to get people to pay."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"i love duolingo but the way they update courses is incredibly annoying. every time, im placed seemingly randomly onto the course again, and oftentimes this results in me skipping several units even though I'd never have covered them before the course was updated! as well as losing out in the learning experience, i also lose out on all the chests & gems. it honestly detracts so much from the app, which is otherwise incredible. how can i learn a language, if I'm missing critical units?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app has become utter garbage: cheap AI algo gets stuck in the same few sentences/topics all over again, I'm halfway through the last unit in Chinese and I haven't learned anything new since I jumped from unit 3 to 4. New words are introduced without introducing the meaning first, gamification is clearly more oriented towards keeping people in the app rather than the app actually being any good at teaching. Paradoxically the lessons to refill hearts are better than actual new units"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"this app is a game changer. It has greatly increased my spanish skills, and the gamification aspect really helps keep me from losing interest as i have with other apps. I highly recommend it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's good to learn a language if you have a ton of time on your hands. It doesn't explain how to structure a sentence very often, and it encourages you not to make mistakes . When you make mistakes, it gets rid of your learning experience, or you have to make the same mistakes to get a single heart back. You can buy the Super version which is alright but really only helps with learning for longer."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've tried several ways of learning Danish, to be able to communicate with my in-laws. None were easy to stick with like Duolingo. My only complaint would be that I've been using the app for about 4 months, and when we visited recently, I could only use a hand full of phrases in conversation. the app teaches as a child would learn Danish, which is good, but at the same time, it's not especially useful for travel. unless you have a year to learn in advance."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's very good, but I do find an issue with maybe dialect rather than translation. The app relies on you knowing American English rather than English English. I've gotten several questions wrong consistently just because I used my own understanding of the translation. For example for asking for a large shirt I have to translate that into 'I would like a shirt size large' rather than 'I would like a large shirt'. It's a small occasional thing but I find it jarring and frustrating when it happens."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been using the app for a couple of years. There are little bugs that keep popping up - like the app using streak freezes for days you've already completed. This month it has happened 3 times. After doing a lesson another user closes the app and goes back in to ensure that the app tracked the activity so they don't lose their streak-though the app displayed the activity as tracked, it will still drop it. Reported several time, but not acknowledged."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Too slow for all its prestige. Invasive and aggressive, sometimes unprofessional. Informative and helpful language learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,it's an amazing speedtest for practice and increase your speak abilities (easy for single use and fast for learning) in my opinion Duolingo Super it's one of the most interesting choices to learn to speak other languages ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A very effective and motivational way to learn a language. There are a few glitches however, sometimes the characters don't display correctly (eg disappear off the screen so you can't see them and therefore have to guess what's there), and during some lessons it isn't possible to choose the correct answers, which is frustrating. Fix those issues and I'd give it 5 stars."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I installed this app when I was a kid. It didn't make any sense back then and I thought it was a waste of time. I installed it recently again and damn! It is the best language learning app ever. I wish I understood it as a kid. I would have learned so many languages till now. Keep up the good work team. Love you Duo‚ù§Ô∏è
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I started playing Duolingo months ago and I've pretty much doubled my level on German. My favorite part is speaking exercises because it helps you pronounce the words right üòç. It is a bit harsh on keeping a streak because even before I wake up I get notifications about playing. That's what made me delete it on my laptopüíª . In all, it is a free game and it is great for tourists, visitors and even people who are neither.If you are thinking about getting this then DO IT !"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,this is the absolute best...I've been using this app for two months every day...even when I was bedridden sick just to keep my streak up and just when I thought I wasn't getting anywhere with it I realized I understood what I was reading and hearing in Spanish...now I can't wait to be able to speak it as well
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I have spent about a year using duolingo daily. I can say that the app is really only useful if you want to learn some words for basic communication. But as far learning to speak a language and understanding grammar it just doesn't cut it. They used to have minimal explanations for each unit but they even took those out.. Plus they do everything they can to drag out the lessons so that you continue using the app.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's a good app for learning languages. It's my second day and it taught me so much of Spanish I recommend it for everyone who want to learn a language. Thankyou duolingo For teaching me ‚ù§Ô∏è
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I used to love Duolingo & was looking forward to years more learning on your platform. The new update is one of the worst changes to the UX of an app that I've seen - they've made moderate tweaks back towards the old system since. UPDATE Oct 23; Duolingo changed design again and removed all legendary status attained on lessons - about a years worth of work just gone in a flash. The literal worst.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Very good learning experience especially since it is free. Only problem I've had is hearing many words in their spoken lessons. Many of the words are spoken too quickly, even in slow mode. Also, many sound mumbled so it's very difficult to make out, I believe the word is conjugation, the end (i.e.: o,en,amos) or start of the words (i.e.:LL..., te..., ell..) which sounds like other letters. I was head of training for ATC for the Eastern U.S. and this was a very important issue in that many lives"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"So far duolingo is an amazing app. it has no flaws, it is certified, and amazing features. something I would like is a feature of what you would like to learn first, such as learning how to speak to others in a respectful manner , or travel, etc. I don't think that the first thing we should learn is how to order food, as most of the time we are going to countries to socialize with society, instead of ordering food or talking about apples."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very good. work well parallel to the alternative conventional language courses with extra content even. Am doing Manderin on the HSK2 level and freshen up/work ahead with this app. even contains content not usually found in the actual course so you'll even learn a bit extra. the various teaching methods they apply work well in helping remember words (like speaking, translating, using images, sound, matching characters with their sounds. makes learning feel more like a game."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Still learning... (myself and the app too). Update: looks like some of the kinks have been worked out with the loading issue. Great! Unfortunately, they took away the comments after each lesson/screen which was super helpful in learning how to correctly pronounce words in Japanese. Sometime a character has several ways of saying it depending on the use. Please bring it back. I don't need to comment but being able to hear the language one is learning is super helpful."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"everything is great, but i recommend adding pictures, It is better with learning. we need to connect the words with pictures, not with a translation, ex. i am learning Russian, and my mother language is Arabic. Meanwhile, i am learning Russian with English, so i'm missing a lot of vocabulary. The more i progress, the harder it gets."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This experience was GREAT it works so well you can pick what language you want to learn and it just helps you along the way and it has fun stuff to like just fun and learning I recommend this app if you want to learn languages like I said I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it's a great app.üòÉ
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"If there wasn't that one big issue, I'd give it 5/5. After traveling and changing back to my original sim card, I couldn't take part in the competition with other players anymore. It's an issue with the time zone. A lot of users have experienced the same but since years this issue isn't fixed. Since this feature is a major part of the gamification experience, it's a major annoyance."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,On a 92 day streak currently; Duolingo is a really good app for learning different languages. But the app does not teach sentance structure which can be really important in learning a new language. But you will eventually pick up on how it is. Intergrating an XP system makes learning a language with Duolingo more motivating.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The app is mostly nice. It's been a pain when things are updated and changed however because you start getting words you've never seen but the app says you have. The biggest issue is constant ads and pushes to get you to pay. I don't know about anyone else but my income is about 12k per year (fixed income) so outside of living expenses I can't afford to pay for an app. Ads are plain worthless because even if I wanted a new car or anything else that is being pushed I can't afford it.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The app is perfect for learning any language. I especially like all the little animations when you take a lesson. Would recommend if u want to learn a language.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"DuoLingo has deteriorated steadily. Shutting down discussion forums removed only way of getting help with language questions. Tips are mostly obvious and sometimes irrelevant. With latest release work done in web version isn't always recognized in mobile. Patronizing ""motivational"" messages supposedly can be turned off, but in web version they reappear next time you log in. Free version became too hard to use with need to replenish ""hearts."" Bugs like promised XP boosts that don't happen."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Always changing the structure of sections is very disorienting. You work hard to achieve legendary status only to the rug be pulled out from under you when your path gets completely messed up.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"very interesting app, especially that it includes the voice recognition and self typing part of it that make it easy to interact with it's program."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It is according to me the best language learning app and has tons of options. it is immersive and fun. Th only small downside is that is tried to get u to buy Duolingo super which cost approximately $20 yearly
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"For someone who's been using this app everyday for less than a year, I'd say that the repetitive exercises definitely helped me learn the language. Though for some users, they find it boring. So if you're the kind of user who finds repetitive exercises boring, I'd suggest you move to another app. Nonetheless, Duolingo has helped me so far."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Grammar lessons and explanations are few and far between. I don't think I learn as well through osmosis like a baby. I need to know how and why things work. I am also frustrated and bored with the limited number of words this teaches at a time. I need much more vocabulary so I can practice in real life, as I live in a Spanish speaking country. Other than that, I do enjoy the mix of methods that include reading, listening, and writing. The gamified approach is fun and keeps me motivated."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I thought the new daily revision, stage 5, in the Italian course would be a great improvement. I thought the system would be able to choose sentences at random for me to revise. But no, I cycle through the same few sentences. The system is convinced I have problems with a handful of basic words and only ever tests me on them. What a missed opportunity! It is extremely difficult to be motivated."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Sometimes the sound doesn't come out and its impossible to solve the question. Some of the characters speak so fast for no need. The app charges you in total for a year.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Emphasis on leaderboard competition detracts from the learning. There's also plenty of useless animation and not enough learning support. For example, I'm VERY surprised that there's not a running list of learned vocabulary to return to, or some space for the user to make their own vocab list. This is an enormous oversight in the structure."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app but there has been bugs with the ads lately. I was doing an exercise halfway when sounds from an add started playing in all of the sudden & there's no way to stop it if it doesn't show up on screen. Worse is when the sounds multiplies automatically, I could hardly hear the lessons. It's an add of a car game, kindly fix it team. Otherwise, great app"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Overall a useful program but somewhat expensive. There also seem to be glitches in the system with points not always awarded.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Overall the content and learning examples are good but unstructured. After several layout changes it is almost impossible to work out what is in which lesson to focus on a revising a particular area although hints are now given if you have the patience to search them. The experience points system, while theoretically it encourages you to learn regularly, now seems to be fully gamified, if being top dog is your thing good luck personally I find it detracts from learning anything useful."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Every single time it gives me a friend quest, especially those that require an amount of perfect or nigh perfect lessons, and even more so when the app hasn't bothered to send me a notification about it at all, it makes me mad. It makes me flashback to the time I had completed a group project by myself and let the other person take it home, only for them not to show up the next day and have to present air to the class. Do not like."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo has huge potential, but despite collecting massive data on how we learn, it feels like that data just went into maximizing time spent learning rather than learning progress. The rate that courses progress is fixed and can't be customized, so sometimes it feels like I've spent half an hour practicing the same few words, grinding through stuff I already know in order to get to something new. Long periods of low variety mean there isn't much spaced repetition which harms overall retention."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It teaches me stuff like ""The tigger and the wolf are watching the turtle in the woods"" but not some things i can actually use in life. After a few months of Korean with Duolingo, I can't even introduce myself to someone. I get the benefits of how they teach but it completely break all motivation to use the app once you realize you don't know basic stuff. Too bad because the app is very fun and well made."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app! The bar is low to keep coming back for a short lesson, but the option to have a lengthy lesson is also very much useful!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really good way to get into the world of languages. Of course, only as helpful as the effort you put in, but can give you good tools to learn words and phrases. Voice speaking can be way too finicky, either giving you the correct ding and failing you, or passing you, then failing you saying the same word"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is fun to learn with, with all the interactive features , however I found way too many adds in the unpaid version (which is like any other app nowadays) and the app also glitches and hangs every few minutes. Plus they put competitive options ,like if you do this, you will get this and keep people glued to the app which can be unhealthy. Overall I don't really recommend the app. But if you don't have a good book , you can try it. Learn slowly I would suggest. Take your time."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really love the app but it bothers me SO MUCH that the stories have been taken out. That was the best method for me to retain conversational concepts rather than this ""only testing"" kind of style. It says that you can ""unlock"" them but I'm really far and still don't have a single story. I retained so much better back when I could access stories"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Almost at a 500-day streak in Scottish Gaelic! I do wish the practice and mistake corrections were available in the free version though, and that you could drag words/phrases around to reorder them in certain exercises rather than having to remove and re-add them if you tap too fast and miss one word in a long sentence."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I do the app completely free and I am learning. I'm in intermediate Spanish 2 in college but my teacher does not offer enough listening videos, so this is perfect. Duo awarded me 3 free days of its paid option.. it allowed me to exclusively do the listening option and less stress of running out of hearts, that was cool. If I get funds on day I well buy that, but as is, duo is a great program üëå. Interesting and engaging"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is good for getting introduced to a language and if you like gamified learning you'll probably enjoy it. Unfortunately there are big differences in what each course offers. Some languages ( I guess the less ""popular"" ones have very little content and don't seem to ever be further developed. I was excited when my Finnish course finally got an update, only to realise that another whole unit of repetitive exercises had been added, rather than introducing lessons with new content."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is not only helping us learn languages but also making it fun to learn it.. mostly everyone finds it boring learning languages they are new to but Duolingo makes it fun and understandable. Thank you Duolingo
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,it's a great app and helped me to learn spanish a lot! but ever since the new update it's honestly become so annoying like you have limited hearts and after you run out all your progress is lost.. like as someone who's trying to learn a new language your bound to make mistakes and the limited hearts thing is just so stupid and restricting!! I've thought of deleting the app so many times but can't get myself to do so by looking at my progress also I'm nearing 365 days streak in 2 months!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Since the update last year application became a lot less usable. There is close to none theory now in Dutch course, no comments that were making the difference and provided additional explanations, impossible to skip one topic you know and learn the other one within one level. Bad job, team, removing great content without adding a replacement. I still use it cause I'm used to it, combining with separate grammar sites. But I am considering checking other apps when my current subscription ends."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The transitions after we pass each section was great. All the characters and what they did. Duo just popping up in the air is terrible and unimaginative. Also, it's sad that you removed the section where we could ask each other questions and get explanations is SORELY missed. The app gives NO explanations, you all are of no help, and you've destroyed what was a community of learners for what YOU ""thought"" was best for US."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,duolingo is literally amazing üëè I know relatives that life in Switzerland so I have been learning German with duo and wow I am a German superstar I really enjoy learning because duo makes learning really fun I have even convinced my grandma to do it and she loves it aswell it also saves ur mistakes so duo can help you understand it definitely download I am on a 125 day streak and love it ‚ù§Ô∏è
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've just started using it since yesterday. It has done a great job in terms of making learning language into a game ,but for learners who are seeking serious learning I think it is still lacking. I would have rated it higher if it could give me a file or at least some materials that I could read or look over before starting the stages because for me the stages are like exercises, but I still want books to go along with it in order to review and take notes."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I use the app to learn Russian. I like the game-like feel, but it will ask you questions without actually teaching you what you need to know before hand in the Russian course. The verb cases aren't taught and you're expected to know the difference in them very quickly which was frustrating. Best to use with another more comprehensive learning tool like babbel imo, rather than alone, as this can be off-putting and make you feel like you're just guessing rather than answering based on knowledge."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,So many lessons that it feels hard to actually progress in learning...like being throttled. But if you test out for the sake of learning more verb tenses and grammar you'll miss enough vocab to make passing lessons without exceeding your daily 5 mistakes difficult. Also 3 times this week it's told me that they synced my progress to reflect new lessons they added. Each time it moved me further back than I could advance by the next time they updated.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a very best app for learning any language I learn Japanese from Duolingo it is not need for notebook,pen in Duolingo because it has writing system. Duolingo is just like a game. We need games like a Duolingo to devlop human skills."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This keeps happening with the new inefficient learning path that has been imposed, the Japanese course keeps changing and I have no idea where I am. New words and phrases are thrown into revision lessons and I can longer practice older lessons. Only the same revision over and over. I don't even know what this is anymore because I am no longer learning anything. It is just a mess and I really don't recommend it for Japanese. It used to be so much better."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,4.5 Stars. Well I just started a couple of days ago. so far it's plenty of fun. More like a game than studying. Exercises are pretty straightforward and made easy and repetitive. I wished it would generate a vocabulary list of some sort. I read it existed but was removed deliberately. I would also wish it would be a bit smarter in terms of identifying my weaknesses. It does offer such exercises but the content is often too easy or doesn't match my weaknesses.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this for a year, but they're constantly changing the format. My biggest complaint is that it will lurch you forward to the next section if you're doing well instead of giving you the option to skip exercises. I feel like I'm being forced to move faster than I want to and not getting useful repetition. As for the game play side, they give a lot less coins and charge 3x as many to play any games so it's an obvious ploy to get you to sign up for super or flood you with ads."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo was fun in the beginning but after their many format changes over the last couple of years and the degrading of gem accumulation and inaccurate progress tracking, it is less than desirable to use. The requirement of having a profile seems pointless due to the lack of customer support if you can't access your account or get a new password."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Update: got a discount played with the paid version, but soon after they removed the ESSENTIAL feature of discussions in which things are properly explained. Now it's absolutely NOT WORTH THE MONEY. Microtransactions are still there for some challenges (and you need those paid boosters by Design) Also I'm super fed up with sentence that are confusing for beginners because the are nonsensical. If you want to learn Catalan (European) Spanish, don't get this, it's Latino Spanish only."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Sometimes the audio doesn't work properly. And still there are some nonsense translations. I might improve my Chinese, but you force us to use some bad English. Furthermore, the speech-function randomly accepts or declines my pronunciation. Sometimes I just deliberately left out some words and it was considered as pass. However, obviously correct pronunciations were just declined. And that prevents me from moving further. But I really appreciate, that my Chinese has become quite good. Thanks!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I really like the method of learning and accent and interface. It is a very useful app for beginners to advanced level language learning. Totally recommend.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A super effective, engaging, and fun way to learn new languages. Duolingo treats learning more like a fun game than a lesson and has many languages to choose from. The best part is that it's completely free with very minimal ads and will always remind you when to study so you can develop a healthy learning habit. Easy 5 stars! (please don't take my family)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After using this for more than a year, I absolutely can not suggest this app to anyone, I decided to revise a language I had learned in my childhood, so I could practice writing and there are just tons of mistakes, if you answer in a more advanced manner, which is how the natives talk, it just doesn't understand and gives the answer as incorrect even if you use a more common word than the synonym the app is suggesting."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Hindi has been offered on Duolingo for years but they haven't expanded it. Spanish language learning tests your pronunciation, spelling, vocabulary, comprehension, listening, etc. Hindi course is extremely limited and all you do is tap words. So you can finish the whole language without it ever requiring you to say one word of Hindi. Despite this, I like the implicit learning model and the built-in features like league leaderboards, the quests, the encouragement from fellow followers are great."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Fun, educational, and a bit addicting. I'm attempting to learn Spanish. The voices are very robotic. The children, in particular, are very difficult to understand, and their pitch is downright grating. Hits a frustration trigger when you're trying to relax and learn. I wish they'd nix them! Otherwise, it's a fun tool. I actually enjoy the updates because they offer new challenges."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Hi...Jayashree this side...the app isn't working from 16th march 2024...I am learning Chinese language...As the app can't be opened even after updating it...I can't practice and my streaks are being frozen...my current streaks is 230....What should I do now????I'm eagerly awaiting for your response
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Good. I am learning a lot of Dutch and Mandarin with this app. It is strongly gamified which helps keep playing and thus learning. You still need to practice and have real world contact apart from the app. Also, better use of my yime than scrolling on social media. Recently they have limited the free features and gone more expensive. I got a family plan with some friends to make it affordable for each(~20‚Ç¨/person for a year), but apart from that, I think for a single sub it is expensive."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Amazing and they let me have the premium Duolingo for three days for free. And it is really easy to learn a new language on Duolingo and it hands down the best app to learn a new language. And Duolingo doesn't have a lot of adds. That why you should download Duolingo to learn a new language.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"As someone studying and planning to teach English in Japan. The idea of trying to speak an East Asian language has been extremely daunting, to the point I never even opened up my book on the language. However the bite size lessons and fun audio-visual guides on here have helped me so much to the point where I'm excited it every day to learn more!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I was not aware that you have stories about same sex couples.. NOT ok. My daughter was studying and she had to repeat a sentence about a girl introducing her girlfriend to her mum and her mum welcomed her to the family. this should be an option you choose and not snack into the app without notice
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a really good app if you're looking for something goofy and threatening to keep you on your streak. It works based on school-like language learning and gives you the chance to get competitive if that gets you more motivated. And even though there are things and a premium version you can spend money on, the app still works perfectly without needing to if you're willing to put up with advertisments. I'd give it five stars but there is still potential for improvement (like a vocab-list e.g.)."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app overall but it doesn't have the language's grammar.how am I supposed to learn a language without Learning it's grammar?? Also, the emails you send us is sometimes annoying 5 stars though, it's a great app Thanks for reading my boring review :D"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I loved this app, & used it for 5+ years, but I don't like how much it has changed. The heart system really punishes you for mistakes, & isn't very conducive for learning. There is also a new problem w/ the visuals aswell. When I was learning Irish, the image for ""I'm a little girl"" was a full-grown man with a beard. I didn‚Äôt know if it was a bug, but I came back months later & it was still there.. so I don't think it was. I don't know why they changed it, but it makes learning confusing."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Really good. Easy and clear layout. Would love for a feature where you could write to others in that language so we could learn better interactions but overall a good app
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazingly simple and engaging language course. The lessons are broken down into small multiple and relative parts. The ability to track your learning, competitive scoring, relative learning and the ability to learn at your own rate is amazing. Best app to start a new language for free and easily a good way to learn a language. I paid for the upgraded tier after 3 days it's that good."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I use it everyday. It helps familiarize with a language. I would suggest using it in conjunction with other means. Classes, workbooks, speaking to others in the language, movies, YouTube and other forms of learning. Be creative. Duolingo should not be a one and only mode as should any of the other methods I suggested. It helps to get in a habit of practice everyday."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good at teaching a variety of languages, from Mandarin Chinese, to Swahili, to Zulu, to Klingon(yes...from Star Trek). Only real complaint is it doesn't differentiate between formal and informal speech. Hope they add that in."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I like Duolingo, but I don't think it's the best language learning tool out there. It makes learning a language feel more like a videogame with competition. For me, this is what keeps me coming back. I do not like the avatars or the new look of the achievements. I wish I could go back to using a photo in place of the avatar. I also think the lessons are extremely repetitive, and don't do a good job of actually teaching the sentence structure, etc. Users just have to use trial and error to learn."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The volume of speech is to low. I have my media volume on blast and I still can't hear. For example ella and ninia sound very similar to me. You need work on the tonality of different characters because it either sounds off or I can't understand. You got the psychology right to get keep learning. Anybody spending thousands to learn any language in college should consider this app instead. In my opinion you would better off. Not for kids under 18.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"They have done an amazing job gamifying the language learning experience. I LOVE this app!! The bite-sized lessons make it easy to start studying, without the pressure of commitment to an hour etc... but then I tend to get into it and end up studying 30+ minutes daily. Perfect for anyone wanting to begin a language but feeling overwhelmed about how to begin!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I paid for a year. That's was alot of money to keep having the app crash regularly. Randomly when I need to type on the exercise my keyboard vanashies and I can no long interact with the app. I have to close it and start again restarting the whole exercise. I use a pixel 6 and it's all up to date. Please fix this annoying bug. Other than that I am am enjoying the app alot.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They were supposed to send out a reminder when my free trial for their individual upgraded ""Super"" plan was about to expire. Never happened. Not a problem since I kept the date in mind, however, the problem is that I wanted to upgrade from the ""Super"" individual plan to the ""Family"" plan. All the directions say you can do this in the ""Manage Subscription"" option on an android, but there is NOT a ""Manage Subscription"" option and no way to contact them to resolve the issue."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The reason for two stars is because sometimes the app doesn't properly explain the flow and function per se of the language you are learning. I've written out the sentance they want me to write down the exact way the app taught it to me, and there was a missing conjunction word that wasn't even worded properly when reviewing the translation of the sentence in the app. It is useful and I like the pace, but you're new language might sound broken to native speakers by the looks of things."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I can't speak Spanish yet but I know a whole lot of words and I have stuck with it. I currently have a 75 day streak without missing a day. I did read that with the Duolingo method it will take at least a year before able to carryon a conversation in broken Spanish even then. I'm ok with it it is fun.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Have been using this app to learn a new language and enjoying it. The learning is super interactive and fun. There isn't anything better to do while I'm free than opening duo and learning.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Duolingo for a while now, and I must say it's a fantastic language learning app. The variety of languages available is impressive, and the lessons are engaging. The gamification aspect keeps me motivated, and the daily streaks are a fun challenge. My only slight complaint is that sometimes it can be a bit repetitive, but overall, it's a great tool for language learners."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A really great option to start out. Easy to use and free. I like the short lesson plans. Sometimes, I only have 5 minutes to spare but that's enough time to complete a lesson. It would be better if it offered more explanations and explained the rules of the language better. It works mostly off of memorization which is great and does help you learn but it leaves me a little lacking in real world applications. Still, a great option to begin learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm learning Spanish, and I'm currently 13 years old. I'm excellent at English, and for my career I want to know spanish too. Duolingo has been helpful, and I'm doing very well currently. I'm doing the trial of Super duolingo, which has also been very helpful. I enjoy the excercises, and they help me understand the language better. I do believe you should use other things to learn languages as well, but Duolingo is definitely one of the sources I use to learn languages. You should try it too!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"While there are good things with Duolingo,here are also the others - too much push for Superlingo for which the pricing is far from being transparently announced; sometimes it is testing more English than the language one tries to learn; and the method has its weaknesses for me (sure, there are different needs and preferences between people) - checking the most simple things more than others, with much of clicking, pre-prepared making it much/too easier than writing it down yourself."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great app to learn new languages. Have been using it for years and recommend it to learn the basics. Pair it with actual conversations in real life to accelerate learning.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"free version is very viable, the ads aren't too bad. Overall the app has been helpful and makes the process enjoyable."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Stuck, alone, in a gamified hellscape! Here are my issues with it: 1) Not a fan of the gamification. Works in the beginning but then using the app feels very much like a chore. 2) No sense of community. With no way to interact with other users, the app feels empty and the language learning experience hallow. 3) Some ads can't be muted. 4) Little to no offline usability. 5) The last stage is very repetitive. When you finish a course you get a ring of six VERY similar lessons. Bad for practice!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Really good way to learn languages, the courses have constant updates to keep them fresh and really incentivize you to enjoy learning and keep it going every day"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is changing all the time. You think you've figured out how to get things done and then it changes and you lose your progress. The one thing that is annoying me is the friends quest set up. One week it lets you pick your friend and then the next week it's like ""you don't have any friends available"" when I know I do. You should not be required to add a bunch of strangers to your friends list in order to participate in this feature, Duo. Stop that!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"they change their apps look and feel so often and radically that I lost the overview. I preferred how it was, clean and easy to use. now it looks fancy and colorful but much less usable. the last update introduced fancy icons to the achievement section but they removed the achievement descriptions. the update before added a colorful style of the displaying chapters of a unit but removed the freedom to solve the chapters of a unit in the order i like, also requires a lot of scrolling."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,lots of ads but still a great app to learn. their strategies to keep you engaged are amazing and include everything from incentives to Duo guilt tripping you into doing your daily exercises. it's fun and joyful :)
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App kicked me out for two days, would have broken my 120+ day streak if I didn't have freezes. This is the second time this has happened. Great app, you guys. Oh look, it's happened again. Third time. Great app. EDIT: As of October 2023, I have been fully locked out of Duolingo. It refuses to let me log in or create a new account. I don't know how you mess an app up this much, but congratulations."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm a LONG TIME fan. Its growth as a FREE resource is fantastic- if you tried duo a few years ago + couldn't get into it, I'd encourage you to give it a try again. HOWEVER, you benefit most if your target language is one of their popular courses (Spanish is phenomenal in my opinion). I can't say the same for the smaller courses. Many of them are littered with typos and bugs, lack audio, or are just plain bad. Duo absolutely plays favorites + its very obvious. But it gets better every year."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love the idea of the app, it really helps and is fun. however last time I have whole days when the app is not working, it doesn't download. also the calculation of the points is sometimes wrong, it shows less than it suggests initially. and some ""errors"" are not fair-for example, showing usage of the word ""mother"" as wrong and insisting it is ,""mom"" in this sentence etc"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"My experience with duolingo has been fun by there are a few issues I would like to report. First the speaking exercises are faulty because when I speak clearly into the speaker it doesn't hear me I nearly have to yell just to get the thing to work. Second, there is a notification problem. For example when a friend sends me a message I don't get the message until a day has passed. Duolingo needs to put in a chat system that allows you to speak with your friends or fix this notification issue."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,the recent updates are great! I was a free user for a long time but I upgraded and pay for it now because its so useful and fun. the lessons really feel like I'm progressing and the reminders and streak system really keep me involved and consistent in learning. I use it casually to learn Spanish and after 2 years I feel comfortable knowing I'd be able to communicate in that language.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"After a few months,still putting in answers with pictures for example a picture of rice,correct answer is le,I put it in,apparently incorrect.Its extremely frustrating and makes progress harder,please fix this asap"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good for quick daily practice. I'm learning Japanese, and I think its really helpful for practicing the different kana. They break down grammar in an easy to understand way as well. There's a lot of ads in the free version that can be removed if you pay for their premium service. Keeping up a daily streak also feels pretty rewarding"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,For some reason it started to sabotage my answers. Sometimes it will not allow me to answer the correct answer. And it will steal hearts from me so that my streak is killed. It's frustrating. Loved it in the beginning now it's not letting me succeed. I lost 4 hearts not my fault.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's really great and motivational! Some of the translations are things you would almost never hear from a native speaker of the language, though."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"this is honestly amazing, I've wanted to learn Japanese for years, and I feel like I've learnt more about the language itself in 3 days of duolingo than my years of on and off study. in my experience so far, it's focused more on the words and characters so far. it feels closer to an actual Japanese course than just learning ""basic and helpful phrases"" which is preferable. you can also ""study"" as much as you want or as little as you want in every lesson"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love how in lessons, if you make a new mistake, then they make you do it again to make sure you get everything correct üôÇ But, it has a few kinks to work out. I do not like how when you have the matching part where you have to match the English translation with maybe the Spanish translation for example, if you get it right, it still shows green for a second... If you know what I'm talking about."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,it is a very useful app where we can learn other languages. But i don't think putting ads after every lesson is useful. I really don't like that.But still am giving it a 5 star review. And i really like this app
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been learning German with Duolingo for the last half year. At first, I really liked it. It was engaging and felt helpful. Then they have reworked the German course and it became much easier. There are now very few exercises when you have to type all the words in a sentence on your own. I don't feel the course is helpful anymore because it is too easy. Also, there too few times the app asks you to repeat the previous material, so it just fades away as time passes"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I need more explainantions. There are too many things confusing me but for example, Por vs Para, ahi vs alli, cual vs que... I spend a lot of time on Google trying to figure them out but I am PAYING you. I am glad you have added lessons that require my listening. I think for myself, and probably most people, it is not that hard to understand the written word, but hearing the language spoken, especially at normal speed, is the most important practice."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm updating my review to be one star because Duolingo just laid off a whole bunch of their linguists. Apparently, they're going to let AI teach us languages now. Shame on them. As soon as my subscription comes up for renewal again. I am canceling. I'll find a real language teacher, not an online game that is powered by AI."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Horrible UI decisions and poor educational structure that drives revenue over language acquisition. I understand Duolingo needs to make money, but it doesn't feel like a tool to learn with. It feels like fragments of a service that I can pay to have organized, but they're still incomplete. I'd happily pay if I thought that the content was being presented to me effectively, but I was very disappointed that this is the language app everyone recommends."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this aap...it's so fun with learning....I can't describe my happiness when I use it....it's so flexible with the learning process I love it... please you must try it.....I never thought I can learn any language like this....I thought it will be so boring and tough but now I can say that Duolingo is my bestfriend for learning languages.....‚ô•Ô∏èfrom India ‚ô•Ô∏èüòá
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When you get something wrong, it offers absolutely no remediation or explanation as to WHY you're wrong. So, you don't ever actually LEARN anything. It's essentially rote memorization, but no actual learning. It's focus also seems to solely frustrate you so you give in and buy their severely overpriced subscription for which you will be bombarded with ads. It's basically a game that wants to fool you into thinking you are learning a new language, but you don't. Go with Memrise instead."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very easy and quick. Learnt more German in 2 hours than in school. I would give it five stars if you had unlimited hearts without paying for it. Other than that, a great app!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app worked wonderfully for the first month thereabout. After that, whenever I attempt to do lessons, I'm told I'm offline even when I have good internet connection and every other app is working. Because of this I have dropped out of leagues and missed practices as I can only review the story I did when I was ""online"". I've tried everything. Updating the app, deleting it and redownloading, etc. but nothing has worked so far. I'd appreciate this issue being addressed and rectified."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Honestly the app is good. It does have a subscription but it only improves the experience and it's perfectly usable even for free unlike most app that wouldn't give you room to breathe because of adds. I'd give it a 4.5/5 but there are no halfs here. My only wish is for there to be s break button or like an easy side quest you could do to keep up the streak even when you don't have the energy for a full lesson
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"(READ THIS BEFORE DOWNLOADING) Duolingo is a great app for free language learning. It can teach you many other languages and is great for someone looking to learn another language or just can't afford a good education. However, there are too many ads like many other reviews mention and the pronunciation and grammar (in some languages) isn't great (but it's acceptable, such as Japanese)."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Got some sort of message that I'd been ""automatically advanced"" and lost 3 whole units that I'd finished - and had achieved legendary status. Also very disappointed to see that the list of learned words is no longer provided, and the forum is no longer available! Why do they keep cutting features? More importantly, why am I paying for the Plus version?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Lessons take too long to load in comparison to before, even with Super Duolingo. I often get ""error occurred"" and have lessons not load and crash. I can't tap on the 5th pathway in section 3 in Italian without the 6th one being in the way. Additionally, I do not appreciate not having the option to go back to the former Duolingo tree format. The discussion sections were immensely helpful too. Why were they removed? When will Duolingo listen to its users' feedback?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love this app. Ever since they removed the discussion pages I lost the motivation to keep learning. I'm only doing the bare minimum each day to keep my 3 year streak alive. Discussion pages were awesome, because I could listen to the sentence as a whole and read the grammar discussions. Without them, it is impossible to reliably detect the many instances of wrong reading provided for kanji building blocks in my Japanese course. And learning feels so lonely now."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Duolingo since 2017 or so, and this is not the first time that my progress got erased because they decided to change its structure. The most annoying thing is, if I choose to skip section & take the test, I'm missing out on the extra bits that are completely new to me. I don't want to repeat 80% of it either. Busuu has a greater respect for the time you invest in this."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Prices are as high or higher than Disney+...and they're definitely NOT spending hundreds of millions of dollars developing this app. Having said that...it's a decent start for beginners!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"New format isn't great. You can't deep dive into specific topics yourself, you must follow the predetermined structure. Also there are ads now after every single lesson to get you to pay. I get the business model and don't mind a few ads, but now I spend more time in ads than content. This app used to be great, now it's time to explore other options."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The free version is okay for maybe learning some new words, but many are forgotten since they are rarely reviewed until much later in the lessons, if at all. The paid version is better in that you get the opportunity to review, speak more and listen more. Not a fan of the competitive side, I think it promotes less learning and more repeating things you don't even pay attention to. Too many people just use the speak portion over and over to beat other players. It's really useless and stressful."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"great free app. I upgraded to family, expecting the experience to be more rich, but no. In the levels I'm at, there are no lessons after a wrong answer OR pre-unit lessons to help. Just a wild west. I actually wish I'd quit at 900 days as originally planned rather than upgrading because I feel like I'm no longer learning. Guessing at answers is never the way."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have been progressing using the new layout now (Japanese) and have to say the changes are a downgrade. Removing explanatory grammar notes with a phrase list (guidebooks) and removing the user comments community which is where a lot of clarification of the grammar occurs has really stunted the usefulness of the app. I really don't mind having to watch the adverts and still think it is a good app but it seems they have shot themselves in the foot with the new (probably a year now) ""update""."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Ive paid for premium. I enjoy learning in the short bursts. most of all the stories. BUT it still glitches in lessons then I have to log out, lose my progress and redo, sometimes several times a session. Also the course has been restructured twice without notice and I have no way to track how much I have done...just to acknowledge me effort."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app but I'm wary of the reward system. Is the reward system in alignment with growth mindset? I feel like I'm being rewarded for playing the game, not learning German. The goal is to learn German, and when I'm getting better at German I should feel better. Match Madness is one that is particularly infuriating - clearly the goal here is to get you to spend money, the game becomes unbeatable at certain levels, why even play it?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Easy for beginners leaening Japanese and the more you learn the more challenging it becomes. I didn't know that you could learn the writings and that has been super helpful to!

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Doing the Japanese course. They removed comments from lessons. It was the best place to get extra info or actual grammar explanations, which are virtually non existent in the app. They keep pushing you back in the path when they make changes. ""you never stop learning"" they say to justify this. I say, I never start learning if you keep pushing me back for two new words you wanted to introduce, and make me repeat dull grammar patterns I've done 1million times."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app works pretty well overall, the lessons make sense and are helpful. Unfortunately some stuff makes it really annoying, such as some of the ads being really gross or weird, or the ads opening on me when I didn't click on them. The courses continuously getting updated and redone lately also gets a bit confusing."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"A lot of bad audio and outright inconsistent answers make this a wallbanger of an app. Points for supporting a lot of languages, but there's way too many frustrating moments. Like when you're typing and sometimes the keyboard gets taken off screen, leaving only the submit button, which of course gets hit and you've just submitted only half of your answer, incomplete and therefore incorrect. No big deal if you're on paid unlimited play, but removes a heart otherwise. Irish is unintelligible"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Has helped me learn for cheap. motivational. could do with more social interaction with friends. Also has taken away comments and grammar tips which were really useful. Could increase variation of games. I like the new challenging radio talk show with Bea which speaks at normal speed. it brings confidence when we understand it.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This game is helpful and amazing! It is a bit annoying that you have to earn hearts unless you get the Preminum, but if you want to learn a language, this is your place üòÅ"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a decent app and has helped me learn multiple different languages. But there is one thing recently that has irritated me. When you have to skip a listening question and hit 'cant listen now' normally it moves onto the next question, but recently when I hit the 'cant listen now' button it moves onto the next question but it automatically makes the answer wrong and you lose a heart. It's not too bad but it's irritating, especially if you've got it all right so far."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"So, from my point of view, Duolingo is a pretty good app. The concept of gamifing it- absolutely brilliant! The thing that makes me rate it 3 stars is the streak. The streak is why a wonderful learning app was turned into a meme. Remove the streak. If this has become a staple for the app, lengthen the time before losing the streak. I spent over 100 diamonds to keep my streak alive when there was no WIFI. Also please, PLEASE make it an offline app. That is how I lost my streak. Thank you."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,the best language learning app but when you lose all your hearts you want to play practice mode which will give you only one heart but we will spend like 5 min to that so please fix it and overall it was good so iam giving a 5star
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used the premium version of Duolingo and loved it until they switched from the tree version to the path version. I canceled my subscription but continued with the new path for 3 months. I went from hours of practice a day to 15 minutes a day with the new Sesame Street version. I resorted to downloading an old version and stopped automatic updates. It worked great until a week ago. Now, every time I practice new version is back - auto updates still off. Deleted app."

I can do my character also, and this amazing üëè üíú I love doulingo, and when I make something wrong, he will tell me, ""Let's correct the every thing that i missed. I love you, doulingo.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is an amazing tool to learn new languages! This streamlines learning in a way that's fun and easy. It's crazy how fast you pick up things and suddenly realize you actually understand a new language. I love in class learning, but this makes it so much easier. I also love how cute it is. Our whole family studies everyday and we love working as friends to complete goals. Duolingo has so much to offer. I really love it. (Not a paid review. Just love for the Duo owl.)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It seems like a good app so far to learn languages so much so I have subscribed, so I can't comment on the free version. Edit I have been using it now for 6 months, and I am getting some audio missing lately. I have reported 1 word where the audio has been missing for several months now, and nothing is being done. If it carries on, I might rethink about subscribing and try a different app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I never knew it could be so easy to learn a language. My previous attempts failed, but Duolingo makes it so easy that in just 2 days I feel I understand more than what I did after 2 weeks on the language course I took."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app that I like. It is just a bit specific with what sentence it teaches you, over all its great! And I like how it's motivating to do a lesson every day."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Been using this for years now and it works as long as you supplement your learning with native language speakers in chat apps or YouTube. Recently, I haven't been able to use any double XP's I've gotten because after the app tells me I have it for the next 15 or 30 minutes and start a lesson, double xp disappears like I never got it. Lost a star for that. Also, I don't like that there is no more discussion for the lessons. Used to be a lot of helpful info there. Lost another star for that."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I used to love this app but they've made it nearly unusable. It's just constantly trying to get you to buy and use things for points, freezes, etc. You can't just use the app without being forced to participate in tedious annoying stuff that derails your learning. I paid for a subscription for years and finally canceled it because it's gotten so unpleasant to use."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app keeps freezing on me. I am an avid user, 327 days straight. Every morning, I try to 'cash in' my night time chest for the 2x bonus round, and 5x out of 10 the app freezes signing in and once I'm able to get out and try again, the bonus chest is gone! VERY FRUSTRATING!! What the heck?! It puts me at a terrible disadvantage in the weekly contest. FIX THIS! And yes, I have uninstalled and reinstalled several times. It is a short-term fix at best."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very, very fun! The only thing to look out for is the fact that to be engaging/gamified, it sacrifices a bit of the quality language learning, so it takes longer. Also, ads can be a slight pain, but the Super Duolingo membership is worth getting if you're going to spend a lot of time on this app. A fabulous app all around, though!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is an absolutely marvelous way to learn a new language ( And help you with a deeper understanding of your own.) lt is difficult to think of how they could improve the app. Definitely a 5 Star rating.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo provides a very fun and sustainable method for learning languages. The learning games it provides provides you with context that is vital to helping you learn languages.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I think it's a great and amazing experience to learn in this app and it's very helpful. the only thing I don't like Is you have to pay for infinity heart and other things that disturb you from learning when the app is supposed to have you learn and wants you to pay for things that are distributing your learning. I think the app is amazing just wish there were infinite hearts and not so many adds
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really want to learn languages but every time I make a mistake it takes away my heart (only have 5) but on the unlimited there is unlimited hearts, that means I am tempted to buyyy hearts with money, (adds taken a way too) that is frustrating because I just want to learn a simple language. Second reason why I have rated it 3 stars ‚≠ê it has languages that I have never heard before and I want to learn my language (Tagalog) that language is also in translation but not in lessons. Pls improve this"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"You can learn languages for free! What's better than that? And, you also get some challenges to complete so that you never get bored! This app even makes you learn the language everyday! I love this!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Edit: now it's not even acknowledging lessons I've done. I did 4 lessons yesterday and it used a streak freeze like I did none. I was enjoying the app but it marks things incorrect that are correct and are verbatim what is listed as the correct answer. It's even worse when you actually know a language and it's not teaching the language properly. I tried to hang in there but it's frustrating learning a new language and then to learn it from an app that doesn't know it either isn't helpful.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"whenever I do a lesson, it thinks I don't click when I do, making me get the question wrong. Also when I do do a lesson, it never registers that I got any xp making it really frustrating. in my opinion, when you do a lesson to learn a language, you shouldn't have to buy ""hearts"" to do it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been learning Japanese on this app for a long time now and although sometimes it doesn't quite get it right and lessons can be repetitive, I really do love Duolingo, and it has been integral in my language learning journey. If you want to get to grips with a language, this is a great way to remain motivated and have fun in the process. The community fosters competitiveness but is in no way toxic, and the achievements and weekly challenges keep you coming back. Overall, it's a great app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great exercise for the brain and cognition. Learning the language and grammar sneaks up on you; I was pleasantly pleased that I could recall, understand and express words, expressions and sentences. One concern, my streak count is not accurate. Even when I do lessons during the day the next day a streak is used. Or if I check before midnight a lesson has begun that I did not begin."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolute banger of a language learning app. It makes language learning genuinely fun. I only checked it out because of the memes, but I actually really like it. If you're trying to learn a language, Duolingo is your guy. Even if you don't have any reason to learn a language, you should still check it out."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Engaging and fun, easy to do 10 minutes each day! So many people are using Duolingo - I found tons of friends, family and coworkers that I didn't know were using it and now we can challenge and support each other. My only complaint is that some of the sentences don't make sense: ""The pink avocado."""
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is one of my favorite apps. It is a great app to learn from. You can choose any language you like! This app has really helped me with my Japanese. Although sometimes the characters giving you words to place to create a sentence they say it to quickly and some hard to understand when I tap on the button to make them pronounce it slower it is still hard to understand and then I get it wrong. Other than that, it is a wonderful app. I also love duolingos' sense of humor!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The grammar is becoming more clear which I attribute to the structured progressive repetition presented in each subsequent lesson. UPDATE: a little after 1 year now...the app remains helpful, however, it seems that progressing up the ladder of levels one may today be #1 in the Diamond league and a top scorer only to discover that somehow after accumulating the requisite number of XP points suddenly one discovers his/her name in the ""Demotion Zone"" the next day. Then it's back to Hi my name is..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, this app is really good, at least on german as I am learning deutsch and I really like how we can now use the streak day as a widget bUT it's giving inaccurate information that I missed a day because the widget shows that I have learned for the day which I realized the next day I haVEN't Q-Q and it still shows that I have done it for the day until I tapped it"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have been learning French for a while, and I have to say that it is a great way to learn a language, but there are a few things that could be improved. First of all, the grammar explanations, which are only in a few courses, could be better organised, for example, with a new ""grammar tab"". Also, there is no way to see what vocabulary I've learnt. Furthermore, why did they remove the comment section for the excercises? It was an awesome frature and they are making the app worse."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I think it's one of the best apps to learn a language, even if you cannot pay for it the free lessons are amazing, I know people complain the advertising is annoying but it's a way to support Duolingo to be free, if you combine Duolingo and reading and watching things in the language you are learning you can get a lot of stuff in just few months studying."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Awesome app, pretty user friendly in my opinion. Great way to learn a language from scratch, (very repetitive)! Has moat of the 'main' languages to pick from. Can choose whether to have the words spoken aloud and whether you have to speak during lessons. Can choose whether to get notifications. All free (ads), such an amazing opportunity to learn more languages."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app starts out pretty good, nicely gamifying language learning. However, as you get to the upper leagues, it gets so rife with cheating as to ruin that entire aspect of the app. After that, it's like any other tedious language app that you have to push through. It was a frustrating shock, and I ended up purchasing a different service."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Did a 14 free trial of super Duolingo and they said they'd notify me two days before the trial ended. They never notified me and just took ¬£89.99 from my bank account for a years subscription. I was never given the chance to cancel or reminded that the trial was ending so they just took the money. This is so bad and a huge scam!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's getting worse with each update. The number of ads on the ""free"" version is ridiculous. Daily achievements are also only granted when ads are watched in full. If you close the app, you lose your achievement / progress. The free version is made more and more unattractive to sell subscription. It's bloody obvious."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Fun, intuitive, user friendly, and makes learning new languages something to look forward to rather than a chore like it might have been in school. My only ""complaint"" is that the automated voices pronounce things in a way that could be interpreted as two different answers when being tested on your listening ability. Outside of that: it's a great app and a great time!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app's great. I use it for Russian and can learn how to say the words in sentences. The characters are iconic and fun. My only issue is that I've gotten a way through the Rookie section and can't speak the language at all in a conversation. Maybe it's because of the reasons I selected for learning, or just how far into the course I am, but those are just wild guesses for now. Hopefully I'll be able to talk to people in Russian if I finish the course. Otherwise, would recommend for learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's the""super duolingo"" adds that are annoying, not the normal adds. Other than that, it's a good language learning app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is pretty amazing, it's easy to use and navigate. I enjoy learning on their platform it's fun and easy, hassle free, and I can see myself improving in my Spanish. Gracias Duolingo üòäüòäüòäüëã"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Brilliant way to learn a language. However, what spoils this app, are the ads for itself and the blank screen with no escape when an ad doesn‚Äôt load properly. Asking me to pay every other round, makes me less likely to pay, not more. Also, why do the Duolingo ads last twice as long as the ads for other companies? I don‚Äôt mind ads, it's a price that I am willing to pay, but how does a 30 second blank screen help anyone?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"TOO MANY ADS for an education application. It does not encourage people to study any more. I believe that study should be free, or at least less ads, not every single time you finish a reason."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duo is more of a resource, it's helpful to learn a language if you know the basics or have another source to learn from. On a negative note the app will give you a limited window to earn double points which will make the leader board challenging because it's on their time not when I'm able to. (Not everyone keeps the same schedule)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is very fun and engaging. Keeping your streak really does help, I'm currently at one of 202 days! Competitive game-like almost, and obviously you're learning. Win-win! However, there is a flaw and that is how the sentences you're being taught are worded. You (or, I) wouldn't use it for realistic conversation. This app is great for [**gradual**] progression of vocabulary and learning the language, repetition, pronunciation, motivation, engagement, and more‚Äì truly. Hope this helps; Try it!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My attention span is too trashed by social media, so I'm turning my phone addiction into learning Japanese for free :) From what I read online, I'll still need to use other resources in conjunction with Duolingo, and I'm perfectly fine with it being that l. So far, I just google all the new phrases that don't sit well in my memory - reading free online lessons that explain the words you get stuck on makes Duolingo feel like a tour guide in a foreign country. It makes it fun to grind learning!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"this app taught me all the missing things. I live in Spain, they understand me, but they never correct my Spanish. Now, I learn where I make mistakes. thanks, Duolingo. recommend 20 minutes a day, not less!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a unique learning language app that makes you feel like you are playing a game while you are learning other languages its cool UI can make you addicted to learning a new language (I GOT FORCED TO DO THIS PLEASE HELP, I WANT TO SEE MY FAMILY) Great app I'm addicted to learn other language. üëç"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"personally, this app has been great for me so far, and learning has been very fun it also doesn't feel repetitive or bad in any way, plus they don't rush you or anything it makes you want to learn more so if you want to learn a language then this app is a must have. ü´µüëçüíØüíØüî•üíö"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"There are segments that introduce too many new words. Learing 10 new words in one segment is too many at once.I want to repeat some segments to get a better grasp, but that's not an option, unfortunately.When doing this on my phone (only way I do it) when you get something wrong the red box that comes up & says incorrect - you should be able to x out of it to see what you chose & review your error, but you can't do that either. When it's too much at once, it's overwhelming & makes u want to quit"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I started 4 years ago and although I wanted to learn European Portuguese it is Brazilian Portuguese. Early on the structure and progress was good. The discussion page and the volunteer moderator was helpful. There are mistakes since this is more AI and recent updates have in my view ruined this app. So I'm finished with it now. Now way of feeding back to Duolingo either. Also struggles to accept UK English which is also correct. My partner has the same problem with the French programme.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's like playing a game rather than learning a language, I'd like to be able to turn some features off (the leagues for example) but the lessons and the learning style is brilliant. I've picked up where I left off 10 years ago, after getting my French A level and it's been so nice to realise how much I retained and build my speaking confidence"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app. Amazing to learn. However, it's annoying when it makes ""adjustments to my course"" and sets me back 7 units in my Spanish. I also feel like it tries to focus on being a video game and having competitiveness instead of being a learning tool. Other than that, great app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This was such a great app to learn languages, but they've gotten rid of so many good things and made it so you can no longer learn a certain category of words, like food related, transportation, or traveling so you can ask for directions, but they got rid of all of that and just made all the lessons random so you can't go back and relearn a topic you might have forgotten a few words from, it's not a bad app, but you definitely need more than just this if you want to learn a language :("
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I had given this app 5 stars, but now I'm reducing it to 3, and maybe to 1. At first, you learn a lot, but as you progress, they quit teaching you and just expect you to catch on. They stop explaining. For some learners, this is fine. For others, not so much. For example, they expect you to know the difference between ""desde"" and ""desde que"" (both ""since"" in Spanish) w/o explaining the difference. I've had to do a lot of digging on other sites and YouTube to find explanations they don't teach."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,They make earning the monthly badges way too hard now for people who actually have a life! 50 in one month is just ridiculous and they aren't exactly easy things to do. I don't have time for this! I feel like since I paid for the premium version you just made it harder and harder!! Its ridiculous!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love the app. Had it for almost a year now. I know five stars may seem a little high either way, but Duolingo is so fun and easy to keep up with. Now my forgetful self lost my longest streak yet and have been trying to get back into it. I'll probably get it back eventually. Lessons only take around 3-10 minutes MAX. Which means you don't have to spend hours trying to learn how to say ""Ich bin Gideon"". Love the app, if you want to learn how to speak another language Duolingo is for you."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Pretty happy with the app. Picked it up to help with learning Spanish. Although there are ads, they are well placed and don't interfere with the learning experience. I appreciate that the app and service it's still useable without paying as I wanted to get a feel for the app and language before I would consider a paid subscription. I feel like the app presents a new language in really manageable chunks for busy people. I can pick it up and practice for just 5min when I have a moment."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,simple to use and its characters are so interesting... very helpful for daily communication... every day we learnt some new words and how to talk to others politely... it's best for those who try to learn English from the beginning.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I miss being able to see your progress to the next award under achievements in the app. That was something that motivated me to continue because I could see how far away I was to the next achievement. Now I'm not as motivated to continue....
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, and really enjoyed super duolingo. However, to pay yearly is not an option for me as I am in a low-income household, and This is the only option so I had to cancel.. I would jump at the chance to get super duolingo again in the future if they start to offer monthly payments as 65 pounds is out of my budget. It seems Silly, Because I think the developers are missing a trick with this one as they would make much more money if they offered a monthly plan instead of yearly only. üòû"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app, can't imagine a more fun and engaging way to learn. if you actually want to learn, you'll HAVE to pay the 10$ a month. keep that in mind, but there's so much content for each language. if you're consistent you can go very far. I've heard it can even be similar to doing a 4 year course In way less time! you can learn multiple languages at the same time too (I'm doing 3 at once, I'd recommend 1. 2 at most)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"So I'm only giving the app only four stars even though it teaches me a lot. But TO MUCH MESSAGES I get so tired hearing duolingo or Lily saying "" You're not learning much (language) you should join and not lose your strike of (how many days.) But I definitely 100% recamend this app you can select any language and pick how much of (language) you want to learn each day and make sure to show up or Duolingo and Lily BLOW UP YOURE DANG PHONE UP but go ahead and have fun:3 also don't lose hearts. 4‚≠ê:3"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it is great, what I am missing is lessons to learn grammar rules for instance. I had to watch other videos to be able to complete the practices."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Its really unforgiving when you make a small mistakes. The lessons are tedious and repetitive. The paid version is too expensive. Overall there arent a lot of different types of challenges. There are a few formats for practicing and they get repetitive and boring. They dont really explain why something is, the lessons expect you to memorize as is."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've only just started using duolingo to learn korean (if ur a die-hard kpop stan, you'll get me) and it's pretty good. it's got a great narrative and an encouraging mindset. the only bad things are the notifications. man, when I was learning japanese, I would be getting notifications at least per hour. the app is encouraging, as said before, but a bit over demanding."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is completely ineffective for teaching how to have conversations in a new language, despite their claim that their training is proven. Instead of teaching early on essential things like common phrases, common grammar, counting, how to use common verbs, etc., they drill the most useless words in the lessons. The key to learning a new language quickly is enabling conversation. When will I ever need to know the words for turtle or crib or horse or carpet in everyday conversations???"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo seems to be an ok learning platform, I have issues with their app, & their customer service is nonexistent. Using earphones helps with learning a language. It immerses you in the language, helping with pronunciation, accent, etc. Yet using headphones with Duolingo is damaging to the ears. The ""DING"" after each correct answer is louder than the content itself. Wearing headphones makes it unbearable. I relayed this to Duolingo, who does not respond to anything. I payed for years, no more."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The Spanish program is excellent. Using other resources helps a lot. Very good podcasts and YouTube videos can give more broad lessons of the whole language (many nouns that end with an -a are feminine, but many nouns ending in -ama or -ema are masculine). If you can afford the premium, there are nice perks. If not, the ads are not disruptive to the flow of learning. I am nearly halfway through unit 4. I started testing out of lessons to speed up my learning, and I plan on finishing the course."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The experience with the app varies between courses drastically. Spanish in comparison to Dutch is polished and has different levels where Dutch is like Anki with even less grammar. Sadly I cannot continue to use it but if you would like to learn Spanish I think it's really good app. Please improve Dutch course as now it's super boring and does not teach anything other than vocabulary.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5 stars! it helps me learn my lessons and I do it everyday and I learn from those days and streaks! I definitely should recommend getting this app if you wanna learn languages! it's very worth it!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Not friendly interface for subscription. Despite the help suggestions, I couldn't change my Super subscribtion to the family one. And no any message about it. When I tried to stop subscribtion, there was message about losing benefits, but it looked as I lose them immediately. Also, today is my last day of subscription. And I even can't find any option about it. All subscription controls disappeared. Also many bugs in Hebrew course, they go uncorrected for years. Good luck. Thanks."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This was good back in 2017, but now it is very bad. For any purchase it asks for 450 gems., but provides only up to 12 gems. So once your gems gets over it is very difficult to use the app without paying. They are cornering and forcing the users to pay. Creating a psychological urge of losing your daily streak et cetera üñï"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a fun platform and I enjoy the language learning dynamics. Unfortunately the Japanese course is full of English loan words. The extra learning also notes a list of hiragana with errors (the tsu symbol used to denote a double sound, ex. KK, when pressed the voice says ""plus k"" instead of an actual double k sound. It might be useful as an app to test yourself (definitely turn your settings from romanji to hiragana) but if you looking to learn Japanese from scratch it's a no."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Not happy with the way the extra charges are done for taking up the challenges. It doesn't give enough/reasonable times to complete the last exercise. it always asks you to buy more time/gems. also, when you make a mistake, Duolingo doesn't always correct you or give you tips as to what the reason for it. So most of the time I have to go to utube/Internet find answers. You can always find very useful French lessons free."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Some problems. When I translate Czech phrases into English, often my transactions are considered an error, when they are not and I am a native English speaker. (word order may not be registered is my guess, with an AI application). Often, when I click on earning additional hearts and watch an ad, it doesn't register and I lose the credit. Also, certain phrases and grammar in Czech from Duolingo are simply wrong, as I cross-check with mother, who speaks Czech natively."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"You know what? I think this is a great language app that does itself a disservice by harassing it's users to try to push for regular use. I do not need emails and text messages telling me to ""not make Duolingo angry üò°"" by not using it as frequently as it would like. The ONLY reason I haven't deleted it from my phone is because it can be useful. I have changed the alert settings multiple times and still, the harassment, which I'm sure they think is ""cute."""
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I dont like the new guidebook format. I feel like I'm missing a lot :/ it offers dry examples with no explanation on how to form the sentences myself. I'm speaking about the Japanese course. Edit 11.02: yay you made learning kanji even worse! I'd say scatter it even more but idk how you'd accomplish that
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is an excellent app but I'm giving only 3 stars as it lacks a very important feature. If it allows us to have a chat with other fellow learners so we can communicate to practice our targeted language.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Update March 2024: They added words learning, so thats 5 stars from me now I think the price for Duolingo Super is reasonable, but as long as on iOS, I can practice words and on Android I can not, I sadly have to give 1 Star."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It is a very helpful and friendly app and It always remember the lesson and the vocabulary is easy. More than 100 of languages are there to learn my French journey in this app and became extremely good analysis by the duo..‚úåÔ∏è
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I can only give Duolingo 4 stars even though they occasionally count me wrong when I am actually correct. I understand that there are many possible answers for any given translation. Also, I am quite disappointed that Duolingo found it necessary to lock and then disable the discussions associated with each lesson. This is a huge loss. Sometime the discussion groups were the only way to discover why you got something wrong."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love this app. Will give 5 stars if you add Latin as a language option. They did so I've adjusted. Thank you for having Irish Gaelic as an option! Takes a bit to get used to. Worth sticking it out.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it's a nice app to learn casually learn a language. you can compete against friends, family, and strangers. it's easy enough, and fun enough to catch children's interest as well, plus you don't have to spend too much time doing it. each lesson is about 3-5 minutes to complete. anyone has 3-5 minutes. it adds up quickly. Duolingo ist wunderbar!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great learning app. There are a few improvement opportunities: 1. Match Madness: change algorithm to increase frequency of newly learned words. ""And"", ""the"", ""you"", not very helpful in building vocab strength. 2. XP Boosts: need user control to ""start"" and ""Pause"" as needed. I often get interrupted by family while the clock is running, after earning a boost. 3. User control to finely adjust speed of listening exercises. There is only very fast or very slow. I need an 80% or 60% option."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Lots of little bugs that are frustrating and take months to fix. Performance problems this year (2023) made the app borderline unusable for months and even now there are synchronization slowness bugs and multi-platform bugs, experience bonus bugs, and just a general reduction in helpful hints in courses that make the app annoying to use at times. And while possibly a coincidence, ever since Duo announced AI-generated lesson creation (2023), more gibberish sentences have been appearing."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It doesn't teach you what you actually need to know. I am learning Japanese and it taught me to say how to say igo to the gym before it taught me to introduce myself. So now I use a different app but I use this to learn the writing systems.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's great for picking up new languages, but I'd suggest to practice on your own pen and paper to help actually learn instead of compare answer choices. The app has so glitches. That's All"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"im learning a language, having fun, and ACTUALLY retaining information. The app encourages you to complete a small lesson each day, which leads to developing a learning habbit. The cute little owel also helps"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is AMAZING üëèüèΩ It teaches you in multiple different ways . You can slow down what's being said and makes games of lessons . If you have zero ability speaking a language this gives you a real shot at learning a new language .
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I am a fairly longtime user and I love and recommend it, and everything was fine until I saw the features English and Spanish learners get that the rest of us don't like audio sessions and little written exercises after an audio. I am sure French and Italian are popular choices, so why can we get those? Also, it lacks a creative exercise set. I know it is a challenge but maybe that's what AI should be for, instead of driving military drones."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app and a fun way to learn. Although I have issues with the voice lessons here and there. It is where I say it in the same voice/tone, but it continues to say try again, making me miss the voice lesson.

Thanks for continuing to be a great resource duo!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I just downloaded the app yesterday and to be honest I REALLY HAD FUN! It seems like I am having a human tutor with this app. It's really great. It has great and helpful exercises which I super love. I even recommended it to my friend and she's downloading it too. I gave it four stars because I'm not quite exhausted with the ads. The ads are too long. But if you can afford to pay monthly to get rid of the ads, then I highly recommend this app. You can absolutely learn effectively!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I am editing this review because I am getting irritated... it won't let me change my profile pic anymore and other things like that but other than that... Great way to learn. It would be nice to be able to privately chat with people that your doing a quest with.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app needs a LOT of improvement! I have been using it for years as well as other apps. The languages are not teaching normal sentence structures for many of their languages. I've asked native speakers for input on a few lessons, and they all share the same opinion. I don't think I will be renewing my subscription unless they can correct the way they teach."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's not enough by itself. I did Spanish with paid version for 3 yrs. I expected to be more fluent by now. Don't feel like I have the vocabulary I need in my daily life. Vocabulary is limited and repetitive. Some contents go against my beliefs and I would rather not translate them... I wish it was ""cleaner"" that way. Also, I wish they had overview of the words taught. It has a fun effect and get you into a daily habit. I want to use Spanish and will focus on spending my time on other resources."

I think this app is really good if you you travel a lot to know places. Sometimes they want you to be really SPECIFIC with certain things but I've never had a problem. I think this could make learning a language easier and fun. Over time the more harder you work the more you can accomplish and earn rewards in game. Duolingo is sooo fun. Goodbye!!!!! ‚ô°"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It was okay before (used to be 4 stars) but then came the big menu update, which made things much worse in terms of user experience and bugs. Now came another update which introduced ads that cannot be closed anymore!! At least there is no paywall yet ... EDIT 2023-11-29: it keeps getting worse, now sometimes lessons aren't counted anymore. After finishing one, you are throw back in the menu as if you had never done it"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"While it can't teach in a personalized way like a teacher would, it's still a decent supplementary resource. The biggest advantage is how language learning and practice is gamified and how reminds are used to build a learning routine. There are some limits on how many mistakes you can make in the free version. But the devs need to put food on the table too and it still offers a lot for free."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is really useful and if you don't idle your time away , then you can really learn it fast, but the only problem is I'm learning a language but I don't want to learn it's alphabets, I just want to learn speaking, I just wish there was a system to skip the alphabet learning. So that's why I'm giving 4 stars."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Some users have access to math and music, but I do not which is upsetting. In addition, when I use the voice to text option for some of the lessons, I submit my answer before my sentence registers completely and the app renders my answers incorrect, even though it registers my answer after submission. Other than that, I LOVE THIS APP. its come such ajl a long way over the years"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Originally 2 stars, now 1. I've been active daily for nearly 2 years. the discussion groups are STILL locked. Probably the most vital part of the app is the discussion as you gain better insight as to why your answer was incorrect. During a friend quest I was given no friend to complete the quest with and duo reset my streak. Sounds trivial but a 30+ week streak to lose over nothing is infuriating. A lot of questionable phrases that aren't applicable to real life situations. Duolingo is invasive"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,duolingo is a very great app.i reccomend it to people who really want to learn languages plus this kind of apps make ur memory power miserable in fact I dont think I have any problems with this app its perfect
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,My app keeps freezing/crashing which takes credit from courses I've done and coins I've spent for things like refilling hearts. It takes the coins but I don't get to refill my hearts and I lose the progress I had in the lesson. At first it wasn't so bad but now it happens everytime I use the app and it's really made me not want to keep going even though I have a month long streak.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Over 3 years after starting Duolingo, there are STILL no explanations for a topic. It is unthinkable as an educational tool that it does not offer explanations. The Dutch course also REFUSES to detect that I'm saying numbers. It literally never recognises numbers. 90% of other words are fine, and some are hit or miss, but numbers are an always miss. I have mistakes I can never fix because the voice recognition can't do numbers."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I think it's definitely a great app for beginners, and perhaps beyond. At least that's my perspective being a newbie in the language realm lol. But I'm learning and having a lot of fun as well!!! üëç‚úåÔ∏è"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app for learning and practicing a new language in a playful way. It has a lot of languages, even Latin and Klingon :)) Is very good in learning the vocabulary and practice sentences. Sadly there are no clear grammar explanations, there are some explanations but not enough. But is very good for practice. If it's combined with woth other learning apps it's good, but not by it self."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Free, good, enjoyable, only couple minutes a day, can make a difference. Sometimes some bugs(like not couting part of monthly tasks, refuse to start every day[restart of aplocation needed to start-""stop aplication/open aplication""] after around 2 years of use to force to buy premium), but for free is ok. And off course variety of languages (from English), make that app one of the best language apps for beginners on Google Play, in My opinion."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Since the updates, displayed a message ""we've synced your progess because the content has been updated"" however, I've been pushed further back, repeating content that I did ages ago & its being highlighted as new. I was in unit 5 before, am now no further than unit 3. It makes you lose interest because it becomes repetitive, boring & annoying that progress has been lost. *update* Has happened again so lowering rating, was on unit 7, pushed back to unit 5. Impossible to progress through a course."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I usually enjoy this app, but the block system needs work. It doesn't make sense that if someone has blocked someone, that they are still able to see each other on the leader board. You shouldn't have to see the person anymore if you've blocked them. Also, I have had so many issues with the voice recognition picking up my voice, and it's really irritating. If these things are fixed, I will have no problem with the app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,A lot of effort has gone into the lessons. they are well done and the pace is good if you are patient and committed. It's worth the subscription but you're really not getting left in the dust if you stay with the free version
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The ads and the pricing are excessive. I don't mind as supported or subscription models, but Duolingo doesn't provide enough value to justify just how much they try to extract from each user"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I am studying polish and using the ""super doulingo"" service which they advertise is supported by AI. I have found that doulingo offers a accessible but crude way of teaching. My main problems; lessons will start with complex sentences and then end with word to picture matching. The polish lessons are not reviewed well. Often I am tested on words that I was not introduced to The AI to help you practice does not identify the words you struggle with. It has me practicing words that are easy"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is incredible! Although if you're looking to get the full experience of the app, I definitely suggest adding the widget to your home screen. It's small, let's everyone see your streak you've worked hard to get, and let's you open the app just by clicking on it. Overall, this Duolingo is amazing, and makes learning a new language more of like a game than a test."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I am really enjoying learning Spanish and they make it really easy. there are challenges to take part in and multiple languages optional. they even teach languages that are becoming extinct. I love the way that it is a really simple design and I am always wanting to extend my streak and they send me emails to remind me to extend my streak. the emails are optional and you can earn streak freezes so if you miss a day you can freeze it so you can use it the next day with the same streak really üíöüê£
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have been using this app for almost 7 months now and at first it seemed as though I was making a lot of progress mas rapido. For the past 2 months or so it feels as though I'm at a complete stand still. Recently the developers have removed one of the most helpful and important features. The ability to discuss with other users how to use Spanish grammer and have a better understanding of why your answer was incorrect. I could pay extra, but I paid for 1 year sub & not paying xtra."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Was a great app. The creator had a good vision but ended up corrupted by money and now the apps just a money sucking grub for the shareholders. Shame. Also.. streaks are infuriating. I hardly use the app now because all the spam about streaks, I'm here to language learn, not play a game."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The lessons are geared for individuals and work on any level of ability. I enjoy the stories. They make it fun and easy to review the material learned in the lessons.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been a Duolingo user since 2018. The app was okay at first. A lot of the lessons felt repetitive and I would get bored, so I didn't stick to my goals of learning a new language. The improvements to the app since then have been monumental! The lessons are engaging and really help you to learn the language. They have thought out the lesson plans well. I fully recommend this app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Really a shame that teaching people a language is not their priority anymore, they just think of money now and I think this will be their downfall. Ads last too long, plus on desktop you used to not have hearts. Now you only have 5 chances before you lose. Shame on you Duolingo, for falling for money which will ruin this app in the foreseeable future."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Poorly structured lessons. There are no lessons at all. It's like being given an exam without any prior knowledge of the content. There are no instructions at all. You're just thrown in and have to guess what the words mean. The speech samples provided are too fast to actually learn from. This is really a terrible and frustrating way to try to learn a new language.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"After Duolingo removed community notes and grammar explanation, learning new language concepts became significantly harder and less convenient. You can also forget understanding any nuance in the sentences for the same reason. Now, doing Duolingo just makes you better at Duolingo, but not necessarily your target language. There are positives. I like that my Japanese course now includes a separate section for learning Kanji. Even though in its current state the feature is severely lacking too."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I learned alot with Duolingo over numerous languages. It's very convenient and helps me keep new words and phrases I learned on point. I would honestly suggest getting the premium membership if you're trying to really practice as much as possible, since there are numerous options poised toward helping you focus on your weaknesses and practice listening and speech much more than in just the basic package."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"i signed up for the full experience, Duolingo offered a free trial for 7 days, but when i asked to cancel my subscription before they charged me $89 they didn't cut it off and wouldn't give me a refund. i lost $89. don't fall for the trap because if you just want to try the full experience for free you have to give them your card info and there's apparently a good chance they'll take your money anyway. i'm angry so even though i was conned into paying for a sub i'm not going to use the app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I got irritated with a lot of the Duo updates and the way it pushes me into competitions and leagues but it does also keep me wanting to push myself. Some of the sentences are ridiculous and I wish there was a British English version of the app as I feel that the American version of at least the AI built sentences are a little rigid and would not be used in real life. I don't like how android and apple have different ways the app works. Five stars for me keeping up with it though. üòâ
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"There is a lot I can't express in five hundred words but Duolingo is only really good for building a habit to learn language. Not to learn one. New vocabulary is introduced at a glacial pace, and lessons also progress painfully slow especially with updates to courses always knocking you back. Having to pay gems to get trophies for your levels which can be taken away without warning is also ridiculous."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"1 month and I find it very enjoyable and effective- One 'heads up' - you are taught a specific word for an object and a couple lessons later, with no explanation or ' refer to this section' the next object has a differing word. Ex. Spanish- computer = computadora...... until it isnt- it now is ordenador. Which is fine..but providing an explanation attached to the change would decrease confusion and frustration. There is no option to ask DUO or other learners."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Really good app. This makes learning new languages fun, and it makes me committed to learning a new language. It also has good motives and encourages you to practice every day with the streak mechanic."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I just updated the app, and I no longer have access to the previous lessons. I didn't do all the previous speed tests. I can't believe I it's an update to have no access. Quite unimpressed."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Imo this is the best language learning app out there. if i had a credit card and was getting paid well enough then I'd for sure get super duolingo so i don't need to wait for hearts. I love this app and i love the features such as being able to review your mistakes, being able to add friends and celebrate their goals and i also like being able to see the progress my friends have using a chart where it compares my daily progress to theirs. I'm looking forward to finding new languages to learn!!!."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very helpful for beginners, and enjoyable too. A perfect app for learning a new language from scratch. Highly recommended."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is nice for practicing languages you already know, and a great way to start learning a new language whenever you want for free! One thing I think would be a very valuable addition to lessons: incorporating memorization of conjugations + verb types IN lessons! I see conjugation guides in the tips book for each unit, but it would be very effective to know the rules behind the phrases we are trying to memorize."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"App is now buggy. It won't unlock the next set of lessons even though I completed the previous one. Also, the hearts system ( now unavoidable without paying) would probably make me drop duo entirely if I hadn't accumulated a bunch of gems previously to get hearts back. The discussion forum and duo language classes are long gone; these made for a much better experience."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The lessons in Duo really helped me refresh my Russian and German that has not been used for years. However, it lacks the feature of understanding the grammatical rule (very crucial, especially dealing with cases in Russian) and the ads are sometimes annoying. Overall though, it's a good app to try and learn foreign language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I would give it 5 stars but one thing I don't like about Duolingo is that recently they have updated the course so now in some lessons it makes you learn over 10 new words in 1 lesson which makes it very hard for you to remember them and it causes you to make a lot of mistakes which results in either you watching ads to get more hearts or buying Duolingo Super (expensive) for unlimited hearts. Nevertheless, it's a decent app for learning languages and it has a lot of languages to choose from."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It is entertaining but I am now sure that they voluntarily remove/steal gems from my accounts. I first lost 2000 gems. I was wondering if I did something wrong. Now I am certain that I bought one gel for 200 gems but they took 400 from my account. Shame. Edit: they don't give gems even after watching adds. They want us to pay necessarily :(
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It won't update, a lot of glitches lately, didn't track my points or progress. I was moved down in the leagues because of points."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used Duolingo on and off for years and I miss the old version of the app. Now there is endless barrage of adds trying to sell you a subscription, hearts and gems system to slow down your progress just so they can show you more adds. They used to have flashcards as well but they shut it down. At least they do not block progress for free users unlike some other apps."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,im really learning a lot. it would be cool if they had a translation tab to practice words and phrases outside of the courses.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Although the app is super cute and I even got super Duolingo option installed there seems to be a glitch that when ever I try to correct my mistakes by repeating with my voice after the narrator's voice is heard, it won't recognize the first part and I can't do anything about it. I have given the app permissions for the microphone and some other lessons go well but some just won't recognize my voice ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It has been a good app to start learning chiefly because there's a big incentive to do it every day. But after 3 years I'm still not fluent, so I'm now taking in person classes."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a very fun, easy, yet challenging way to learn a new language. the plethora of exercises always make learning fun, and they really help when it comes to retention. the premium version is also very much worth the money, and I'd recommend it to anyone trying to learn new languages. they even have Klingon and High Valerian for trekkies and GOT fans alike! Again, I would highly recommend it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I wish Duo would explain why and when I should use different varients of words. I feel like I'm guessing most of the time because im not sure of the conditions to use a varient etc. Otherwise its excellent. I've never managed to stick to Scottish Gaelic,it's too difficult to learn if you're in an area that doesn't teach it in schools"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Learning with Duolingo was once fun, but now even with the paid version the constant push towards gem sales is annoying and tiring. Want to stay on top of the leaderboard? Sure, purchase some gems and cheat through the xp yielding 'specials'. Your daily challenges? Complete the XP yielding challenges that are impossible to beat without power ups. Want to complete your track? Sure, buy some gems to cheat through impossible to beat time challenges. Learning has taken a backseat unfortunately."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Same as everyone is saying, good app messed up by the update, you can't practice properly or easily revisit topics nor pick what you wish to do. Perhaps if you were starting from the beginning it might be alright? But it feels a lot of content has been cut and it's harder to focus on one topic until you are happy with it. Otherwise 4/5 if you have pro, the lives are irritating if you don't. Update: every update seems to make this app worse, please just stop."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've been practicing since 2017 and Duolingo helped me so much in getting better in Portuguese. thank you so much. I really have recommended this app to a lot of people who wants to learn any new language.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am in love with this app, so engaging and making it FUN to learn. love the repetition to really help it stick in our heads. the reminders to get us to always do our lessons each day are hilarious, fun, and not annoyingly nagging. I think what you guys are doing is AWESOME. I LOVE learning every day. it's a great way to wake up and get my brain working. can't say enough good things about Duo. I even got the family pack so I can share with others and help them learn too!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Overall experience is good. There's a bug where after playing the match madness, when the round gets over and there are still some matches left, it shows to buy the time ups. Then the app freezes and we are unable to proceed from that. When I reopen, I see I didn't get the XP , nor I got the new streak I made. In this way I have lost a lot of gems. Please fix this"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"useful and fun -Learn a little bit about a new language, healthy for your brain, joyous for your mind. Duo is just as fun or more than most casual game apps on top of that. Very highly recommended."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Unfortunately, the developers have decided to not allow photo avatars any longer. This is a mistake. Please rectify and allow options again. Added: updates harmonized adds, this is good. The avatar issue continues, I award one star."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"People say they don't have enough time to complete the timed tasks, but as a gamer, I can assure you that it is possible, as i have done it. The app doesn't glitch for me, very smooth and fun. However, one small thing that is stopping me from giving it five stars is that recently i have apparently ""disappeared"" according to my friends and i can't follow friends any more"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The features are great, but the app is slow and laggy. Sometimes just hangs when I finish a lesson. Other times it just takes forever to move from one screen to another. I think that having a snappy experience is important. Also sometimes it just loses my boosters so it's buggy too..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is honestly so peak. It's extremely useful and effective. The streaks give you so much motivation to learn every day and you learn so much in the long run.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Duo for a few years now, and I feel I've seen a lot of the changes done through the years. I think a very useful part of the app was removed which was the sentence discussing aspect! A lot of community resources were shared through those discussions I also think that, if Duo prides itself in using international language level standards, it should include an adequate grammar explanation for each section, like it did before for the PC version! Grammar is very important!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"A lot of times, points from each unit sometimes are not added correctly. Many times, I have lost up to 200 points in a day and no way of notifying duolingo that I know of. I thought I was getting a free trial, and my credit card was charged. I'm still trying to get my subscription canceled. They need to have email and customer service phone number for any problems that may surface while using the app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's amazing really. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there's only so many times I can write ""my cat and my dog"" and ""I eat an orange"" before I start to lose my mind... the beginner levels should really go so much faster... you can always go back and revise the exercises, but it's annoying when you are forced to repeat basic phrases SO many times. Overall though, the app is great and there's a reason why it's so well known."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Leagues suck big time. I thought I was supposed to learn a language, not compete against cheaters. One other thing, I don't want to ""get more with duolingo super"" or whatever, this is getting incredibly annoying, getting this shoved on my face after every other exercise; I can't go 3 exercises without this pestering me, it's incredibly disrupting. I frequently get pestered about the ""new widget"", which never gets added to my home screen when ""accept"" it, and doesn't show on the widgets list, bad"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Pretty cool, not always perfect I've had a few times where I use a different wording or something and it rejects my answer but I think it makes up for any smaller flaws by being very accessible and user friendly. The only other thing is that you're going to have to do research outside of Duolingo if you really want to learn a language, it's good and it probably comes at no surprise but it's not going to meet every need. Still, Duolingo is great and I still rate it at a 5 star."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's all about memorizing. There is no teaching the language. Now, the pay service is being pushed, at least in my experience, ""lessons"" seem set for you to fail, so you'll be more enticed to pay since paying gives you unlimited lives. But make your own opinions because I'm an idiot with a 534 day streak that keeps playing this game."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm enjoying myself. I enjoy the learning aspect. I am glad that it constantly notifies me to take at least one lesson a day to keep the streak going. It is starting to stick. I am going through a separation with my wife, and it's been a hard time. I hope that when I get the time to spend with my kids that I can teach them other languages as they grow to help them pursue a meaningful career. Thank you"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. I'm autistic and have adhd, so it's hard to keep myself motivated to do anything daily, but I'm enjoying duolingo so much that I am spending time on it instead of a game or YouTube. I learn Japanese on it and love the course. the widget is really cute and keeps me from forgetting about duo. the only request I have is that we have an easy to access list of all of the vocabulary that we have learned, because I want to make a physical vocabulary book."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The program is good, BUT the Data tracking should result in jail sentences. You get started and it is well suited to learning light conversational Spanish. The game format is nice and does help motivate you. I did not mind the adds that it pushed, a fair exchange for a free program is to put up with adds from time to time. But then it demanded a ""profile"" complete with enough information to track you across multiple platforms. RUN . . . DO NOT WALK AWAY from this insidious data mining spyware."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The language learning aspect is fine but the app is really buggy. When you finish a module it says it doubles your points for 15 minutes, but it periodically doesn't. When you say you can't listen for 15 minutes, it automatically marks your next answer wrong periodically. Some of the listening tests periodically can't be heard, so you end up getting those wrong too. All these bugs keep piling up and it's very irritating."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! The premium features are well worth it. I have been using it to assist in learning Spanish for a few years. Though I began with learning the fundamentals of the language elsewhere, it is a fantastic learning companion. I feel there should be elements added for different dialects, not only Mexican Spanish. There have been issues with the app crashing lately, especially after a perfect lesson. It has been frustrating. Other languages are not as well developed as Spanish."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I literally LOVE Duolingo!! It turns learning a new language into a game, and it is so much fun. I love the leaderboard. Also I don't know what people are talking about in regards to ads- I maybe got 5 total in the past two weeks I have had it, and I have been on Duolingo for 3 hours today (don't judge me, I was on a road trip üíÄ), with 0 ads. Definitely recommend getting! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'ce been with Duo since the app first launched, and no other language learning program is as effective, as adorable, or as self-aware as Duolingo. They are serious about their mission. No other program would ever admit its limitations. If anything, Duolingo under-promises what it can do for you and under-gamifies its daily language puzzles. I intend to keep my streak going indefinitely."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"For the most part I really like Duolingo, and hence paid for a year's family subscription... but I have two issues with the service. Firstly, the timed match exercises... on the face of it I have no problem with these, but it would be helpful if Duolingo had previously mentioned the words being used! It's difficult completing timed tasks when I've not met the words before... and it happens frequently! Very annoying! Secondly ... no characters left, so that will have to wait! :o)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"the words they teach will change mid lesson. they promote ""game"" mentality vs learning. they have taken away group support when you're answers are incorrect and you don't understand why. The ""hints"" only offer the words, not the Grammer or sentence structure. I'm learning, but slowly and with frustration."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is a good app for learning languages. it allows you to learn different languages including Klingon. How cool is that! You can adapt it to how much time you would like to allocate towards learning the language of your choice everyday. The user interface makes it easy to navigate along with the colourful graphics and friendly tone of the app. Learning to remember the special characters are difficult though because it's like learning how to drive a car.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"best language learning app I've seen so far... their best strategy is repetition which helps absolutely well in memorization... fun challenges, achievement, streaks all makes the app wonderful.. very minimal ad almost like there's none.. just be intentional about your learning, motivate yourself and the app would give you all you need to keep you motivated..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It's fun for the most part. The accents and voices are too much like robots. sometimes I find myself listening to the same one 6 or 7 times on slow and I still can't tell what they are saying. Eventually I guess and get it write. I don't want to be guessing though. This part of it I think it's showing me down its frustrating. I can't see myself putting up with it very much longer.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A very helpful site. Do not forget to take notes for yourself. One thing I wish is that the site had context specific language lessons like Spanish for the workplace, or German for tourists, or English for doing business in Japan. (Japanese English speakers use different expressions from American speakers.) Still, useful lessons. And a fun highly motivating interface!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like the app, because it is very useful, I also like that it keeps you motivated throughout the lessons and makes sure that you are always reminded that you are in track and I like the fact that it gives off different levels"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is a solid app for getting an intro to just about any language. I like to practice before I go on an international trip so that I'm not completely lost when I arrive. I gave it 3 stars because there are lots of bugs, & the forced free trials of SUPER Duolingo are annoying. The comments from the public on the older lessons help me learn IMMENSELY. I wish there were comments in the new lessons. There are deeper explanations in the comments, and I learned cultural context. I miss the comments"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"a bit odd at times e.g. lacking articles in most noun review exercises or m√∫ltiple meaning. like ""will"" = testament '. too many verb abbreviations in English like ""I'd in duo speech could be I would or I had ."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I am learning Spanish to communicate better with some of my employees at work. I am enjoying the varied approaches to learning this Duolingo provides. It has been easy and engaging. The competitiveness of the lessons makes you not want to lose. The only part I don't like so far is that I can't seem to rearrange the tiles when building the sentence translations. Instead of being able to slide them around, you have to drop the tiles and re add them in the appropriate order. It's a minor thing."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,At first I thought the all was pretty cool but after trying to learn the same language for almost two years now and still not being very good at the language- I can't help but realize that Duolingo has been giving me the same information over and over again. There are quite a few basic things that I've had to learn through random people on the I teener because Duolingo has failed to mention it even once. This all went from fun to annoyingly unhelpful.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Most of my family has been definitely interested in learning French but we all have things to do so we don't get the time to. But when we do, some of us would use Google Translate (but it's not exactly 100% correct..)

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I enjoy learning languages on this app cause it is fun and very educational for students who love new facts .My favourite app right here is better than anything.It does not waste your time at all . Love and totally recommend ! ‚ù§
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,In my humble opinion the free version is barely useable. The competition platform they set up leaves you with no chance at all if you don't pay for the app. It also feels like they leave the timed lessons intentionally near impossible to finish with out buying more time. The point structure makes this less a learning app but one geared towards just making you spend more time worried about points and also spending money on buying more time to complete lessons. It's rigged.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love it! I hope to can get to the level of conversing, even with the free version cause I've heard my brother's Super and though he was getting previous lessons while I had simple stuff. I guess it makes sense."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"*Lowering rating bc feedback form never works--frustrating* UI, an engaging app. Speech practice is particularly helpful. The rewards system is motivational... When it works. The app needs updating, so rewards are consistently applied, or that stages progress on timed games are captured properly. I have a free premium trial right now & I'd be quite disappointed if I was paying for the inconsistent reward system, as points can literally buy one more practice time."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great additive for language learning. Just runs odd on pixel. Have to reset the app a quarter of the times I finish a lesson because it'll refuse to load, sometimes I just have to do the lesson over again. The notifications are jank, this week alone I both got a notice that I was in the demotion zone, while being above it by 500 xp, & then didn't get anything when I actually was in the zone two days later. Still the game itself is good"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"it is a good app to learn the basics. However, the app is pretty unforgiving when you write correct answers in your mother language, and it tells you, the user, that you are wrong. The AI should understand other ways to translate a sentence as a language learning program. Furthermore, the rate at which new words are introduced is much slower than if you just took a class. But I still find it useful to review."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"good to start to learn a new language but lots of 30 sec adverts. can make 5 mistakes before needing more live, having to learn the basic things again that you know because you done it 100's of times. its annoying you dont get to chose the lesson you want to learn or practice. if you pay you dont have to but the annoying thing is they dont explain anything, its more like a memory game than actually teaching the language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Recent updates designed to remove functionality free users have enjoyed for quite some time. Users are frequently set back in their lessons for arbitrary reasons intented to slow progress - and subtly encourage paid subscriptions. Awesome courses, good pronunciation guides, excellent comprehension exercises, high quality production value really make DuoLingo stand out. Two stars for the recent push to hurt free users. Otherwise, I HAD been considering a paid subscription. Not anymore."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I had stopped using it for a few months, and when I tried to get back on track it doesn't let me continue. Whenever I try to continue from my last lesson, it won't load the lesson and will simply say ""an error occurred, please try later"" but it doesn't fix no matter what I do. I even tried reinstalling it, nothing changed. The previous lessons load just fine, but I can't make any progress if the new lessons don't load!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Steals hearts. Several times i got to a point where the learning word was not in the choices and it makes you use all your hearts up. Then you can either review test for more hearts or purchase. And the testing is made harder so you fail so the end result is you have to purchase or lose your run of successfull days. I'd rather lose consecutive days then but forced into purchasing hearts. It was good while it lasted until they started playing games. So long. üëã
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I don't think my Japanese would've got off the ground without it and it manages a lot for a complex language. The Japanese has updated twice - the first time improved the order of lessons but lost me access to forum discussions that I relied on heavily to plug Duo's gaps. The latest one seems unnecessary and it's stopped offering translations to some of answers. UK English speakers, will find some annoying 'mistakes' due to the US translations. Looking forward to the music course though!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used to really enjoy this app. I still think that doing away with the tree was a bad idea but I was getting used to the path. They've ""updated"" my course at least 3 times in the last 6 months and each time it seems like they did it for progress sake even if it's not ready. So many of the English translations are wrong and so many sentences are too rigid in word order, marking things wrong when they shouldn't be. It's making it impossible to learn and when I report it, crickets."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I've been doing duolingo for almost two years thinking maybe I was the problem but no... this app does NOT help you learn languages. Total waste. After 2 years I don't speak any better Spanish than I did on day one. Don't waste your time. Hard to learn anything with the app. Don't like the recent update either. Can't even practice because it gives you to do lessons with no help so your just guessing. Just trying to get money out of me so I have to pay to do lessons I still won't understand.

(give me my parents back pls)
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"very good little program. worth paying for super if you are serious about learning and what to practice a lot. only complaints are not enough speaking practice for my taste and the speech recognition is to ""lenient"" if you will. I can now read en Espa√±ol better than I can speak it, but there is some help with that. also id like more stories to read for practice. overall, have been using it over 60 days striaght, and would & have recommend it to friends and family!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've used a few other learning programs before. I feel like this one is more immersive. it has you try to figure out vocabulary before the words are actually taught. it will then show you the correct vocabulary, only after you have tried to guess on your own. the exercises are similar to games that make it fun. they will reuse the same phrases with the same vocabulary many times in a good way, that you begin to remember and recognize the words. it's not like taking a class in school. I love it!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Its helpful for maintenence of other studying you should be doing. If you don't pay the heart system is limiting and frustrating. It also wastes your time with a lot of stupid gotcha repition questions and takes hearts away for things like ""ohhhh you said ""really good"" instead of ""very good"" and thats completely wrong!"" so its often quite frustrating."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is great and I'm only rating with 2 stars cause I have a request/ idea that would make it even more easy to learn. It would be ideal if there was a section for every word that we learn,thus we would be able to see words that we forgot without having to do reviews over and over hoping to find the lesson that has the word we are looking for(plus even if we find the lesson it is not guaranteed that we'll find the word immediately)."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have been using this app daily for 3 months now to learn Spanish and though I can't carry a full conversation yet, I can better communicate with my coworkers and family. Hoping to be fluent by the end of the year"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There is no pronunciation function on this app nor can you look up vocabulary. Speaking is one of the primary functions of language, I find it odd that it wouldn't include something like that. It looks like at one point they tried, however the exercises were removed so you just get a lesson that won't load. If it wasn't one of the few options to learn Swahili, I would just chose a different app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"fun and effective ! I am coming back to this review to say the new updates to the achievements system are either buggy or confusing - I can see my earned achievements but my progress to the next level of the achievement is no longer displayed. I can't imagine taking out a helpful and motivating feature is intentional, so perhaps it's a bug?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"From a linguist: The overall course structure, unit layout and accuracy has improved so much over the years. I love the mini-games available as well and opportunities to revisit old units with incentives (maxing out points/gems etc.). The social aspect has been a huge game changer in terms of maintaining my streak for longer periods of time (both in competition and supporting friends on the app). REMEMBER to apply what you learn, take notes, repeat each phrase to integrate your new language!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo helps me understand Spanish so you should try it, and it was my dream to speak a different language and Duo helped me with that and now I can show my Grandma that I understand her in Spanish. And Duo is very cute too and I'm loving it so you should try it out!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"By far the most engaging, addictive language learning app finally found :). I automatically open this app daily no matter what and the way they teach the language is engaging and interactive, it is truly amazing."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,App crashes often especially while playing ads.. I am learning Spanish. Course is good.. I wish they had a section for direct translation like Google translate..
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is teaching me how to write and speak in Spanish, and the great thing is there is more that one language to choose from, and if you're really committed to learning the language, then you can get more minutes into it and of you want to learn other languages you can always go back and choose different types of languages to learn from."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App is glitching. I literally just finished a lesson and it did not record it. This happened before and I lost my almost year streak causing me to not want to use the app at all anymore. Now it's happening more often than it did almost 6 months ago. It's also not logging consistently for the monthly challenges either. I have to do 2 or 3 lessons before it actually updates the days on the monthly challenge. Sometimes, it rolls back the days I've completed the next day either way. So funüòí"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am giving it full rating as it is very fun to learn and by the daily streak goal you will every day learn new words. I learned Japanese in just 14 days by using this app really,it is not only a language learning app but it is also a fun game."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"having an awesome time learning italian and Hawaiian, but the paid version is quite expensive, especially since they raised the price quite a bit. if you can afford the full version, this app is amazing. the free version really limits how much you can learn at a time with its limited heart/mistakes system. really like the streak it keeps for you"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Unfortunately there is no feedback page on the app, so I hope this feedback reaches the staff. First, I think there should be an option to practice just grammar, just words, etc. (I use the non-paid version). Secondly, I think there should be a difference between brazilian portuguese and Portugal's portuguese. Other than that, pretty nice app. I even have recommended it to other people."

I have a 3+ years streak and went from not being able to say anything apart from a small introduction and not really understanding to be able to get by. Only 3 stars as it constantly glitches, and I keep losing point and stuff which is very annoying"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'd probably like the app more if it didnt take forever to restore hearts without playing for them, and if they provided explanations for WHY something is wrong instead of just telling you the answer. There's also occasional issues with the app registering what you select when doing sentence practicing, causing the words to be selected in the wrong order from it being delayed or ignored."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used the application for more than 30days. The exercises are somehow grouped, but are repeated again and again. At least for Romanian there are lots of errors is translation. At least you can tell that you found an error/problem. The stages are somehow generated, same exercises repeat and some of the voices are so bad that even in the slow mode is impossible to understand. In my opinion it's a huge waste of time, this is the reason why I decided to uninstall it. I cannot recommend it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo has been FANTASTIC for learning Spanish!!! Over a number of years I had been (slowly) learning Spanish by attending classes (online and in the classroom), as well trying to practice speaking Spanish whenever I went to Mexico. But I feel that Duolingo has REALLY helped me progress in my learning. And it's been a GREAT way to stay motivated to learn, and stay accountable!!! I used the ""free"" version of the app for a while. But SUPER Duo is the way to go!!! Thank you Duolingo!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Been using the app for over a year. It's kept me engaged daily helping me learn a new language at my own pace. Excited to hear additional updates coming like math and music to continue learning more. it's been fun learning with friends and strangers in the form of small social elements. The only suggestion to the app is to have more ways to interact socially with others while learning the language. I've been using other apps to fill in those gaps in the meantime. overall 5/5 will bang daily.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Sometimes, your program is subject to glitches, i.e. no possible correct answer. Happens very occasionally, but nevertheless, it is very disconcerting."

Duolingo has made language learning fun and accessible. Highly recommended!"""
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"In the beginning I learned a lot from using Duolingo. But with the constant updates and changes to courses I find it difficult to make progress. The update for 2023/10/01 moved me back to unit 7 from unit 10. It not motivating me to learn and progress. With the changing of the course materials, I was forced to start all over again, because I missed words/phrases that is repeated in new lessons."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The 'hearts' system isn't conducive to learning - the app turns you away when you run out of hearts, and there is no easy way to regain them (or at least, no free options). The Super trial spoiled me (and I smashed through the units!), but now it is over I am struggling with the relentless ads in the free version and my learning has slowed to a crawl. Shame Super is so expensive!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is a great application to introduce a new language and reinforce key lessons in a cool and interactive way. Love this app and recommend it to all my friends and colleagues constantly.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Broken on iPad. Doesn't show quests, doesn't show streak. Furthermore completing quests doesn't update the total number of completed quests when checked on Android. Early Bird Chest and Night Owl Chest don't get synced across devices so you can't use one device in the morning and another in the afternoon. On the whole this app falls flat when it comes to language learning because the developers spent too much time adding useless features with bugs in them that distract from the main purpose."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It is really a good learning app! It is just like a game. I like this app a lot! Highly recommended if you want to learn a language. Im currently learning Japanese with a 10 day streak but still I haven't gotten bored.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The concept is good and makes me stick to a learning habit. But the app has a bug in phone. The voice recording does not work at all so each time I try to learn Chinese I lose all my hearts because the app never records my voice. It just stops recording after 1 second and says I am wrong. I have the right permissions set. A friend of mine has this feature working perfectly on his own phone.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is getting worse. They don't specify which pronouns to use in a sentence and you get marked wrong when you are really right. Clues are never correct! It only makes it more confusing. They need to explain how their stupid clues are supposed to work! Their listening feature only picks up a word once even if you have to say it multiple times. Keeps crashing. No longer explains language rules in new lessons. This stupid app is getting more unworkable. Absolutely worthless.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,this app is really good with the occasional advert and not totally dependent on buying the premium version to use it. its slow pased so you actually learn
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duo lingo is the best language app I have ever gotten .You can sit down and do it or take it on the go.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible language learning app and even more abysmal support from the Team. Yes, we all heard it from Mr. CEO himself how underwhelming the Duolingo experience can be, but it's even worse than that. From features to usability, this app utterly fails. The gamification is fun in the beginning, but it just devolves into repetitive exercises, lack of teaching methods, limited vocabulary, excessive farming, etc. The Team never addresses the bugs I am sending them, and I am a paying customer! 0/10"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"First, it's a great app to learn new languages, although I've tried my native language and the answers don't seem correct (Indonesian). Mostly when I type, it has the same meaning with the duolingo answer but it wasnt corrected. I also have problems with the leaderboard system, firstly I was put in a leaderboard where almost everyone in there has super duolingo and I don't. I checked the leaderboard and 2 random people popped out of nowhere (and replaced my rank (no.1))."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great animated interface, but limited learning pathways. Cute gamification which wears thin after a while.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the new app updates. I started taking duolingo to learn Italian, but realized I wasn't getting very far in speaking, reading, or writing.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Was pretty disappointing to learn that duolingo has fired a large majority of their staff, and is using a.i.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,i am really getting excited learning from this multiple languages app. duo is great but i would love that its pro purchases be reduced to absorb more learners in the world. what an amazing app!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is like anything else that one could learn. Personal discipline to do it every day, and repetition. Absolutely worth the expense of purchasing the premium version,if you can spare the funds- They have it for a year, would absolutely take that option. Not only does it offer a HUGE variety of languages (Spanish, Japanese, Arabic, Latin, Klingon and High Valeryian to name a few), it seems to be designed in such a manner that gives you small rewards every time you complete a small lesson."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's an amazing app that will easily teach you a language. The only downside is the tense or respect problems with french but all in all is a great app to use alongside a tutor or teacher
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I managed to learn German almost fluently in only 5 months by doing around 5 lessons a day but the problem is that duo sends you messages about every 5 minutes that you are not doing lessons and some are even threatening, but overall it is a great app for learning a language quickly for a trip or holiday."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Confusing interface. There are dozens of pictures on the screen but there is no indication if these are buttons or decorations or what. Poor design. If you figure out how to practice a lesson, it says the new words aloud only sometimes. But the worst thing is that you are limited in how many times you can do a lesson. If you make a mistake, too bad, you can't try again until some unknown time in the future!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Been using it for over 4 years now and it's improved greatly. except for the abundance of ads in the free version I'd give it 5 stars. I'd pay for a subscription but all of these SAAS modeled apps are through the nose expensive. the old one and done model with PC software was the bomb but I guess this old man has to get with the 2020s. remember the good old days when Netflix was 7.99 a month?
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Used to be so much better. - No forums anymore. While not all replies were accurate or on topic, it still was invaluable as Duo doesn't believe in grammar or explanations for most languages. - A/B testing. Would only make sense if you did surveys of the features you're trialling. I. e. new achievement icons, my version has no progress bar so now have no clue when I'll reach the next level. - Stopping development on less popular languages like Welsh that had an amazing team of volunteers."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Listen I love Duolingo okay? My only issue is the heart regeneration and gem reward system for non super learners. I get it, you buy it and you have more advantages but it's crazy. I went to sleep with 0 hears and woke up with one. I know we can practice to get hearts but it's just a bit annoying because I don't have time to be constantly on the app. And if I want to refill my heart's I need gems, which I only get 5-10 from time to time.., otherwise it's really the best learning platform I know."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is great for learning new languages because it helps you learn the alphabet/new words. An issue with the app is the lives. Some languages, like Japanese, can be more difficult to learn and 5 hearts can be lost very quickly, unlike Spanish, which has a similar vocabulary structure to English.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After using the app for more than two years: - The app is playful and puts you on a mindset, but in terms of knowledge it offers is vague. Their claim that by finishing a course you get intermediate knowledge of some sectors of the language is simply a lie. The level they offer is begginer! -If they want to improve, I believe one first good step would be to stop repeating and adding lots of new words. -They do these updates and they simply erased my legendary progress (hours of practice)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It could use a little work in when why or how sentance structure is made, more than it does but it is fun, educational, and competing with friends is fun. not as good as a full blown class but works on your schedule and keeps things interesting. i think islt is a great precursor to college classes and I think you could speak enough to get by on vacation after a couple months, at least for real basic conversation."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,this app is pretty fun to have even when you're studying with friends easy way to warm up/get started on a language you want to learn. can help befinit users before buying a official course. the award systems are neat and fair depending how long you study and correct the mistakes you have. I wish there was a better study when it comes to writhing any alphabet since a lot of times you wouldn't remember how to write a letter/symbol properly. hopefully they will update this soon.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love the app and it makes learning a new language very easy but there are lots of ads and you can only make 5 mistakes without buying premium which is very inconvenient.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Glitches galore. Repeating back certain words and phrases are constantly unaccepted and jumps from simple to beyond anything you've learned up to that point. No context given for why words are used in multiple situations. I understand this is immersion learning but there needs to be more information given than just repeating phrases that really don't make sense.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Generally it's a really good app, although you can enjoy it free with ads, BUT there is some options like mistake review, which in my opinion is really important for learning a new language, which you can't use without paying for the subscription. Also I don't enjoy that there is still some languages that aren't covered, and please make a differentiation between Brazilian and European Portuguese."

I went from the Emerald league (should be the highest for Irish) to bronze in a couple of weeks by just using the app as I always did. A bug is making it impossible to choose the last lesson of the irish course in legendary mode. And the last update caused it to be impossible to choose from the word bank sometimes.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The most recent update changes the way your achievements look. I mean we're not in first grade Duo, come on these icons are really dumb and they actually give you less information than you had before. FOR example on the computer app, I have scholar, and I was at level 10 and I had 1,932 words out of 2000. I almost made that achievement but now Duo has screwed me out of it. Once again like they screwed me out of the stories achievement. OH but whoopee we get cheerleader ü§¨"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The App itself is ok, but if you create a profile you may aswell put a noose around your kneck. It's very hard trying to figure out how to delete my account and get rid of duolingo. I feel quite trapped."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The free version is filled with ads, and strange currencies. There are limits on how many mistakes you can make before you need to take a break or pay, which Duolingo says is designed to make you concentrate - but you can skip this feature with premium. In other words, Duo is offering premium not as an upgrade, but as a solution to problems it created itself, and which it says aren't problems, but features to improve concentration. The order in which you can complete lessons is inflexible."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is ok. I dislike typing in exercises because I'm doing this on my phone. it also introduces new words in German without giving you the English translation. you get the English translation later, so it is backwards at times. sometimes the instructions are vague and you don't know what you are supposed to do. also, it is teaching extremely basic German, not really conversational level. aside from having to type in answers which I dislike doing all in all it's fun to relearn German."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is great for beginners in learning new languages but when it comes to the saying the words part sometimes you will say it right and would mark it wrong which makes me and probably others no want to finished their lessons so please fix this or something.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"As someone learning German, I quickly discovered that it wasn't what I was looking for. While I was interested in learning more traditional, Germanically based language, Duolingo provided a more modern experience. While this is perfectly fine and good for early learning, for me it just wasn't what I was looking for. I hope this guides people in the direction that they want to go."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is wonderful but could maybe find a way for us to learn offline some of us leave in countries where data is crazy expensive and things the same,that's why am not always here cause I don't always have data and I end up missing classes aside from that am okay üëç (The app is wonderful thanks ü´Ç)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"it allright in general, but I don't like that they introduce the need to know how to spell random words very early in the first stage - I don't find that helpful at all when I'm just learning the basic sound of the language. so I wish ""written"" exercises were selectable the same as listening and speaking ones are. this seems like a simple fix they could make."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Lessons have improved. For over a year I practiced every day and barely made any progress past base level. I find the days lesson is about 3 question too long and I like at after 23:00 hours if you haven't hit your day streak yet, hearts should not come in to play. I don't like that I can't see what all the leagues are called above me and easily compare to my friends. I want to challenge more friends. **Contrast of text and selections are very hard to read at times, esp the matching pairs**"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's good except for the ads There's too many ads. Finish a lesson? Ad Think about something else? Ad. There's way too many ads I will rate this 4 üåü but if u fix it it will be 5 üåü And it's also a problem to get to next league because on restart the ads are the biggest problem
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,All useful tools have been removed from the app. It used to provide information on why the sentence is constructed the way it is or explain when you got something wrong. Now it just says you are wrong. No guidance is given. Nothing useful at all. Doubt I will be renewing my subscription.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app. I'm taking German lessons, and I can really tell I've improved a lot since when I started learning German. This app has made me way more fluent with other languages, and I would recommend installing it and giving it a try when you have free time."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app for learning languages, but I would like more instances where you have to form the sentence yourself. They have upgraded it, but taken away the dialogue from users that discussed the syntax of the language, so for me this is a backward step, as I found this very useful in working out details. I would also like more variety in the adjectives used to broaden my knowledge. Also, my suggestion for the future would be to allow the user to alter the content, hence tailor it more to their need"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very good app for learning new languages. And very user friendly and interactive UI. Highly recommend for those who want to learn new language.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Your ""Match Madness"" is irritating. I went out of my way to 1 star cause of that nonsense. Not enough time for the matches to appear and is discouraging A few of my lessons gave me the wrong answers as correct ones as well. Like words I had just learned then went to apply them and then the right answer was a word I hadn't even come across before. In Spanish I know ""computer"" is ""Computadora"" however it says I'm wrong when I typed it in. It gave me a totally different word as the correct answer."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great way to learn a language, though the app has some problems. Most notably, I'll do my daily practice on first break at work, only to be told 'i haven't practiced yet today' by lunch‚ÄΩ The quests clearly show i did something today, but I'm forced to do another round! It's like the game purposefully pads engagement and can be very annoying if you haven't practiced yet by the sheer amount of notifications it will give."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have been a subscriber for almost 3 years but due a recent Duo bug, I lost my 1250+ days streak. I emailed Duolingo but no answer. I had a yearly subscription which is non-refundable even if I can't use their services. Still no answer from them. Very disappointed in you Duolingo, you let me down. Customer service= 0"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Undoubtedly the best language-learning app, I'm currently learning Japanese, which is one of the hardest languages to learn and so far, it's been a walk in the park. Thanks Duo"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have fun with the lessons. I enjoy maintaining my streak by taking one lesson a day. The fastest lesson takes 1 min, so even on my busiest days I can still manage to hop on. Fantastic when paired with other learning programs."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Please please fix the mic function in the speaking courses. It does not receive my audio anymore. It loads too quick and tells me to give another try. Also, the new app icon (the distorted bird face?) is troubling to look at. I have reinstalled this app three times just today to no avail and these two things follow everytime. Otherwise, Duolingo has been a great experience. Can't wait till we get a more robust community experience! Maybe bounce off our tries on our friends?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like the application but it is better to give an explanation for everything like for every exercise. As of now we only get to know the answer and we have to relate the concept based on the option, it is good if an explanation is given like how the grammar works how the sentence is formed something like that Thank you Duo"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is the most immersive app I have ever downloaded. It is truly the best app for if you want to learn a language and it has features to motivate you like streak society rewards. This is when you earn rewards for keeping your streak to a certain point like a different app icon and a bit on your home screen showing you your streak and whether you have completed a lesson today or not. I also find it cool that you and your friends can gain xp together on Duolingo in special quests.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I don't usually write reviews - whether good or bad - but Duolingo deserves words of praise. The app is well thought out. There's lots of repetition and therefore a chance for the new language to imbed. It's modules are easy enough to tackle initially but the difficulty ramps up soon. So overall they're challenging but doable and stimulating. I'm doing Spanish. worth a go daily.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Good app which I'll carry on using but falls down in some areas. Speaking exercises are hit and miss. It can't tell you how you're pronouncing words wrong so you don't know how to improve. I'm also sure sometimes it fails you for no good reason even when I'm sure I've spoken the phrase exactly as per the example. Other gripe - the app only uses US English which means we're forced to use words like pants and store instead of trousers and shop as I naturally would as a UK English speaker.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app was great, but now I am not sure it's worth it. I was about to subscribe to it as it really was helpful and affordable but this latest update has changed things. The courses themselves are pretty easy, but then you get slaughtered during the chapter reviews. Also, is it geared for children now? It's really off-putting, it's now presented like a board game for kids, with animated characters consuming lollipops. I'd happily buy the old app. Updaye: It's gotten worse."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good repetitive sentences and phrases. I signed up and paid for the yearly access but if occasionally still asks for more money at certain times, which is annoying"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Every time i open this app, i get a sudden feeling of warmth and comfort. The encouraging messages help me progress into achieving my goals, not just linguistically, but als mentaly and phisicaly. This is truely one of the greatest apps in the observable and unobservable universe. Each time i break a streak, i get e feeling of extreme guilt that's wants me to burn the state of Michigan (no hate). I just want to thank duolingo and it's creators from our society from bionuclear apocalypse. Thanks."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I am learning Japanese to support my stepdaughter. It is a good language app for fun. However, I find it strange that in the review part of the app it only tests the main lessons and none of the Hiragana. Which to me seems a valuable part of the learning that is entirely missed. You have to make a conscious effort to keep going to this section. If your competing in the leaderboards you end up getting stuck in the review section to make the most of your double XP buff which can get boring."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I use Duolingo to keep my Spanish skills sharp and build upon existing knowledge I have from school. I've also tried to learn Japanese and Chinese (and also tested High Valerian out of curiosity) and I've found it much harder to learn a brand new language using only an app. If you already know the basics of a language, Duolingo can help you build on that and improve, but it's best as a supplement, rather than your only teacher."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The perfect App to learn a new language. Even for a beginner, and it wont take more than 30 minutes of your time in a day. Just perfect!!!!!!.....üòç"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a really good game to learn different languages this is also a wonderful app experience. You can also learn Korean, Chinese or Japanese etc. If you want to learn a different language for fun or for school or anything else, this is a good app to download and I highly recommend this app. üëçüèª"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"While using the free version of the app, ads have started playing during the lessons I'm working on simultaneously in the background. The noise from the ads drowns out the audio cues from the lesson. Since the ads are running simultaneously in the background there is no way to exit the ads after watching. I have logged out and logged back in, and I have deleted the app and reinstalled it, and it is still happening. This is a really underhanded way of making users buy the paid version."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love this app and recommend it to any of my my friends who want to learn a language or two. I even have super lingo. But the fact that I pay monthly and still can't use the Speak feature get me frustrated every time. I literally started super lingo FOR it. I have sent multiple bug reports to the app and still haven't gotten any reply or a working Speak feature. Please fix this Duo, you're my favorite owl and I would love to give you five stars :("
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like it, you do actually learn a lot, but not enough to speak at all fluently. Nor do you learn all that much about the technicalities of grammar. That's approached more by rote. Big criticism is the number of times recently there have been dramatic changes that have set me back, and it has taken months to regain my position in the learning tree. Good revision, but very discouraging."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The fact that Duolingo is so consistent that I don't miss a lesson makes this app the best. Everything's easy to do, and the visuals are amazing! One thing I would recommend is to give more priority towards writing and speaking. There are exercises for it, but there could be more to pronounce and write it better! Other than that, this learning app is up to the mark!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Okay, so great for passing time and quick learning simple words and ideas. But I ,like many of you, are not those language geniuses who can learn a language super fast. Don't count on this to learn a language, instead use it as supplemental, for the hard-core language learning on phone. Download Drops and Rossetta Stone , Drops is like duolingo but cooler and not free, and Rossetta is hard and expensive, it's more intense but it will actaully try to teach you sentences and real Grammer."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Best language learning app I've ever downloaded. Me, being 11, wants to travel, and the app helps to make me near fluent in a selected language. It also doesn't hit you with a million and one things at once. One downside is one of the characters would say, for example, in Spanish, instead if saying yo (I), it would say Jo costing a heart"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I wish they provided literal translations even if they don't make grammatical sense in English. I don't always understand why Duolingo chooses certain translations over the literal ones. it adds confusion. especially when learning a language that is structured differently. highlighting the difference with a literal translation makes it more memorable.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is famous for a reason, It repeats the same exercise over and over really ingraves it in your brain. So far everything is absolutely amazing. Totally recommend! üòä ü¶â üíö"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm only intermediate in my second language, and even I can spot mistakes and unnatural sentences everywhere. There's always been some, but it's gotten much worse since they fired most of their human staff to rely on Google transla- sorry ""AI"" instead. It's irresponsible, and teaches and fossilizes mistakes, setting learners up for failure. How am I supposed to trust anything duo tries to teach me when they don't even care enough to pay actual humans to write their sentences?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,this app is really helpful for beginners and others too..... it gives us a lot of options in choosing languages along with hearing and speaking practises..... thank you duolingoü§ó.... for your helpü§óüòò
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,it actually helps me learn a lot more I'm starting to learn new things that was hard for me but duolingo just came to save my whole entire life and I wanted to learn France and Korea so bad but without duolingo it would be hard for me thank you duolingo for letting me learn new country's and new words that I have never learned
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have been using Doulingo for many years now(although my streak is short), and never had it lagging like that!! It lags 24/7. For the past week I've been fighting the app just so I can learn a new language. I tried but there's no update available for me(although my brother has an update), and my sister, who has the same version as me, has the same problem. Also, grammar is never explained unless you're wrong around 3 times in a row about 5 units later. Do change it please."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Everything is well but since the last update the widget hasn't been working properly, which caused me to miss a couple of days. It just shows that I've already done the lesson today even though I didn't, it just stays this way from the day before :/"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have several ways to learn French including private 1 to 1 lessons and always struggled. Duolingos various methods are simple and straight forward. I am learning French, Spanish and German at a phenomenal rate. Definitely hands down the best way to learn any language(s). I also recommend paid version for faster learning. The free version doesn't let you progress quick enough as you will pick it up fast. 10/10 Highly recommend."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a very fun app and very helpful... But I must warn you, if you don't mind spending $83.99 for a year then your good, if not BE CAREFUL WHAT SUBSCRIPTION YOU CHOOSE!! Other than that, this is a really good app... Though it jolts you into sentences suddenly, it's still pretty easy... I'm having trouble remembering certain things but I can read Spanish pretty well, French too... I am also learning Latin and High Valyrian, which is pretty cool! So... ""Kirimvose Duo!"""
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The game-like nature of the app is great for keeping you studying every day. As someone trying to learn on their own, I cannot express how helpful it is to have a system of reminders and goals that are already all set up and ready to go. However, it's pretty lacking on pronunciation help. I also wish there was a vocabulary list of the words you've encountered so far and a more detailed review of the grammar concepts you've studied. A fantastic assistant but not a complete class."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'd prefer more variety of types of lessons, you do feel like you're doing the same thing all day long. For the most part you are expected to select words that are in individual boxes by clicking them and they populate a line of text. It's all a bit easy and quite a slow pace. The owl nagging you to play, when you haven't for a while is also tedious."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I find the app itself to be the best language learning app for me and it goes well alongside the classes I attend. My main gripe is that some of the adverts play at full volume even when the volume on my phone is all the way down and the mute button has been selected on the ad. This is incredibly annoying and makes me want to not use the app at all.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been a heavy user of Duolingo for almost two years. At the beginning of 2023, they extended one of their courses into smaller, unnecessary chapters and kept adding overlapping phrases, which I found super annoying. While this may be part of their business strategy to monetize, it seems to deviate from their mission of developing the best education in the world and making it universally available. The pace of learning a new language here is quite slow. Honestly, I wouldn't recommend this app"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've used this app many time's and it never fails to impress. Duolingo is a fun way to learn and the streak system makes you want to learn more. Overall I think this is a very fun alternative to learning languages.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"A lot of the words pronounced through Duolingo are completely wrong. So if am ever going to want to communicate affectively in Japanese, I'm going to have to undo any wrong words that Duo has taught which sucks!! I'm still using it now, because it's something easy for me to keep doing daily, and I'm almost at a 365 day streak. I would definitely recommend disabling listening exorcises, and find other resources to learn listening and proper pronunciation."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Duolingo in very good to learn a new language but if do not take it seriously like if you not take notes whenever your making a mistake you will probably forget almost everything you learnt. Also like I started duo in like 2021 and at that I was learning French for the first time and I was not able to remember everything so I stopped it but now I my school has started giving proper classes for French so now duo does helps me for my revision. so ether take French seriously or attend proper class
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Context: Learning Japanese. After a recent update, the lessons have gotten a lot better. I'm seeing obvious mistakes and bugs far less now, and the larger variety of question formats helps a lot with slowing down and really understanding the content. There's still a lack of learning support for kanji writing, but this update was a big jump in the right direction"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love it, I'm using it to improve my English because I'm a Spanish native speaker and it is just like a game, addictive, not so easy but not so difficult, There are some features that I haven't tried yet but so far i love it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,this app is amazing 100/10 would recommend. one small thing and I know it is dumb but only if you had unlimited lives without having to pay money or just pay like 5-10$ for infinite lives forever that would be awesome. other than that also duo give me my family back I only missed one day for my German and French.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app works good, and it is a fun way to learn. However, way too many ads in the free version, and too expensive for the paid version. I can't justify paying $20 a month for an app that I only use a couple hours a week."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is really good for learning languages! No green owl haunting me at night and forcing me to type this message too lol. on jan 18 2021 I saw a black van with 3 kids inside, I didnt report to anyone and I still remember the van number. Anyways, its really great!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This has got to be by far the best language app for me. Despite all of its rumours about if you miss a day duolingo will come for you it's just a myth. They try there best to motivate you to do your lessons and there way of teaching you is incredible. The way they also help you remember the words is really cool. It's a fun way of learning different languages and I would definitely recommend!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Makes learning Hindi way to hard, I would not recommend learning Hindi with Duolingo, not enough explanations. Got stuck with their grammar, could not figure it out. Lacks explicit grammar explanations. You just keep on repeating the same errors. App is useless to learn that language"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's very good, I have been learning Spanish and French on this app for over 6 months now and I am very satisfied with the results of my learning except I wish there were more languages to learn such as Serbian üá∑üá∏ please add more languages specifically Serbian"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love using the app. At first I found the sentences very irrelevant to real life. I'm not sure if the app has been updated or if the sentences get more relevant as you go through but I'm definitely learning more useful phrases than before. I wish you could click on answers to get more info when something doesn't make sense but there's always Google I guess. I make notes as I go along and am finding it really good. I definitely think this is a fun and convenient way to learn a language
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really like this app, but they need to make support available for each course. I'm taking ltalian and Korean, and I'm doing well on the Italian, but there is a huge gap in the Korean course, and I suddenly got lost from one unit to the next, and there's no help available. The app is much better than it was, but it still needs much improvement."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really enjoy the app, definitely a good way to learn, just wish the updates wouldn't push your progress backwards. Doesn't happen very often but it's still slightly annoying"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,A good way to learn a language without text books and the chance to hear how words should be pronounced. Very helpful to write down phrases if you can.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm removing my 5 star review because I can't switch language courses within the app anymore... please fix that. Also, in my japanese course, it would be nice if a review of Kanji characters also included drawing them."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it's truly really fun, I'm an avid fan, I'm learning japanese so I can take my dad to Japan one , there's so much there that him and I would love to see, and the way duo goes about it, is fun and it's at your pace but pushes ya limits a little in a way that helps me confidently progress. I highly recommend, take the chance, a few minutes out of each day at least, lemme tell ya it's worth it. and to the folks at Duolingo, I love y'all for what ya do. keep it up"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There are some mistakes in the bangla word. like I, My, both meaning is the same in bangla in this app, and if I select one it shows wrong and one life is gone. You need to improve this, those are your mistakes, not the learners."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Below is the first review for five stars. But today you deserve only two. After I finished the third lesson four hours ago the application went blank for several minutes, then my results were shown. Then blank, then a notice that ""Daily quests are updated."" Then blank, no records of my lesson. My streak is 834 but every now and then I get the urge to uninstall Duolingo. I love it! It is very cleverly designed for learning. I've been using it for over 700 days. Thanks for resolving some glitches!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm really enjoying learning German with Duolingo. there are different types of exercises so that you don't get bored and different characters to learn along with. Me and my friends. enjoy having friendly competitions in the friends challenges. I went for the fully paid up version so that I don't have to put up with ads. Once I've aced German, I'll be moving on to learning Klingon."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The restriction on free hearts causes me to take fewer risks when entering answers. Also more tips would improve the experience (e.g. correct placement of ""de"" or ""que"" within a sentence is not always obvious."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I studied Spanish before going to Esperanto. Overall the app is a great way to enter language learning, especially when coupled with friend groups. The main reasons I can't give 5 stars to this app are the following: - Some of the courses don't introduce fundamentals until further in - A flashcard system or Dora The Explorer approach to an interactive video/book in Duolingo would work wonders - The Esperanto course and other minority courses could use updating (even if demand isn't that high)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"aside from the notifications guilt tripping me into doing a lesson, very good. I appreciate how I can redo lessons if needed, and duo helps me if I make mistakes. I've taken up three languages and I think I'm doing quite well at most of them."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible updating. Have been learning Italian for 578 days. Updates have now boosted me way further ""ahead"" into lessons causing me to have no idea what's going on. I went back a few lessons and there's words and things I've apparently ""learnt"" and already checked off but I've never come across the words or sentences. Really disappointing to not be able to access a discussion relating to the answers anymore. Was planning to upgrade to super again but now I will not be because I'm so lost now!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Has really helped practicing the language. Would be good to have more explanation for the grammar, but works great as a supplement to a language course."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It very respected, successful, and earnest application, that encouraged me to learn many languages like Italian, spanish and french. I wish they went on by the same easy and kind style in teaching the language. thanks"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it is a nice app, makes learning fun. but there is a request duolingo can you please bring back that option in which we can complete a level at one key level.."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love Duolingo it is very helpful and I know how to speak kinda speak French and it is very fun and easy to learn I just think they need to add a bit more languages but other than that I love it!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After introducing hearts it's really frustrating to learn new things as you run out of hearts quite fast. Also advertisement seems to be getting longer since a few weeks. Edit: After switching to plus to be able to download lessons i noticed that the feature is not available anymore as it was before and had the problem multiple times that i could not continue offline as the lessons were not buffered while i was online, which makes the plus feature extremly useless."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great app and super fun to use. I've been using for over a year now and while it's slow going and pretty sure I could go down to Mexico and be able to navigate while speaking in Spanish.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Such a good app that really helps you learn your languages. For me it's Japanese, it's been very informative and in depth with it's lessons and the way it reinforces it's grammar and material!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I still love this app with my whole heart, but it's gotten noticeably worse over the past year or so. They've completely removed comments, which contained many helpful explanations since the explanations duolingo gives have always been severly lacking. Often times the English translations simply don't pop up anymore, so if you dont fully understand the sentence you're out of luck. I'm still a huge duolingo fan, but i hope it doesn't deteriorate as a result of becoming a publicly traded company."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's one of my favorite apps I have on my phone, but I noticed that the recently got rid of badges and replaced them with achievements! What the heck?? I'm proud of how hard I worked and all badges I was able to collect, and am using the subscription to complete as many legendary courses as I can. I appreciate this app and everything that goes into it, it's just very disappointing to see the achievement structure be changed like this. Porque esto, estoy muy triste ahora y quiero mis insignias."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is not for actually learning a language. It is a social media app in the guise of language learning that monetizes your FOMO with comically harsh reminders, rewarding you for maintaining a daily ""streak,"" and by comparing your progress in using the app with other random users. But in terms language learning, there isn't really much there. It's just simple games with words, there's no lessons, no grammar, no explanations for why anything is correct. You could learn an alphabet, though."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The app may seem cute and fun if used as a game but I encountered so many wrong translations for the vocabularies. The grammar structures are also very much like perfect schoolbook grammar that no one actually uses in real life or sometimes even completely wrong as seen from a natives perspective. If your goal is it to actually lern how to speak a language you better be finding penpals or friends who can teach you because with Duolingo you will be stuck on a kind of beginner level forever.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I overall really like the app and would recommend! I use free version, ads are not that annoying, there's only one after each lesson but you can skip those. Minor cons. There's some weird sentences like ""the fish drink water"" or ""when do they die?"", I've seen some incorrect English there too. Also I've had some problems like doing the same exercise few times (no, not to correct a mistake) in one lesson, like it was repeating the same few exercises for the whole 5mins lesson. Overall I recommend"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The learning tree is not working. I would like to decide myself which lessons I want to practice. I don't understand why Duolingo transformed to this new learning tree layout, making it almost impossible to find the lessons you want to practice. Furthermore, the app continues to include plenty of bugs; the latest one is that it only counts 1 quest when 2 quests gained at the same time. And sometimes the quest isn't even awarded at all ..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I'm having difficulty logging into my Duolingo account/ app and I have 1 year subscription. It is not funny. Please Duolingo customer service do something about it. Thank you.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I liked the comment section and feedback from the previous version. but I like set up of the lessons in the new version. I also used the previous version with my students. this new version. is less user-friendly in that aspect.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,it is great for students or maybe just for fun. it makes learning a new language so much better. but I don't like how we have hearts. Like what you have to pay if you wanna make mistakes
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app for learning, but I'd wish they have us learn the alphabet and numbers first. The ad after every other lesson is quite bothersome, but that's only if you're on edge. Overall, nice app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like it. it's better than before, in my opinion now you can have personalized experience. duo, let's you choose where to start your journey if you know a little bit of the language you are learning or if you know nothing !!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love this app the only thing I don't like is when it comes down to the wire for your streak it shouldn't be for your ending time for the lesson but your start time. I can't tell you how many freezes I've had to use because I've gone over by a minute. when learning a language you shouldn't have to feel rushed to keep your streak!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"No longer shows insight on grammar / syntax in the unit notes / guidebook, but instead, ""key phrases."" Seeing as Duolingo's whole mission is to foster learning, this is a definite miss for me! Much better to see the fundamentals + put 'em into practise immediately for faster + deeper longterm understanding. Kanji voiceover pronunciation also needs fixing, this has been a ongoing issue. Often miss marks 'cos I don't know the alternate reading, which VO said. Handle these issues, and we're golden!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Really fun way to learn and practice a new language. Rather than studying lists of vocabulary or rules of grammar, you spend your time reading, hearing, speaking and writing in a new language. The paid version is worth it to me, because there's no penalty for mistakes. Frequent challenges, leader boards and other game elements add to the fun. Highly recommended for anyone wanting to learn a different language!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"the way they have changed how you learn is 100% terrible, it will show you a new word once and never again but will quiz you on it or it adds new words even when just doing a review! the sections have a bit of everything involved so there's not really any distinct topic, it's very hard to focus on a section you were having difficulty with, you don't get to decide anymore what you learn or when to move on, I was learning great before but I HATE with a passion this new pathway. going to a new app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This learning app is soo good.. how ever they should slow down the teaching lessons and fully explain (maybe it's just me) any hoo I decided to learn the actual Japanese alphabet instead and gives u daily xp. Which is helpful.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it's good. definitely was better before the company went private. it's less intuitive and some phrases aren't useful or accurate in the native language. as a supplement to other learning strategies, it's good! the streak can encourage you to be consistent in your practice"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a good language app. The vocabulary is a bit limited but the exercises are varied. Overall, it can certainly teach you the basics of a language. However, there's been a bug where I can't record any audio for over a year now and no matter how often I report it, it doesn't get sorted. Quite inconvenient."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app itself is a great app, and it's very useful for learning languages, but the one problem I have is the fact that it doesn't have the same updates as the iOS version. My friend also has duolingo, but he has an iPhone, and he has features I don't have like avatars, the option to learn math, and the option to learn music. I do think that the app is great, but I don't like the delays between different operating systems."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I think Duolingo is a great app, I absolutely love learning on this app. There are not many adds, it's not hard to navigate and it's super fun. The reason I have given it 4/5 stars is because I find it extreme frustrating when I have to go back and redo a whole lesson just because I got the fix your mistake parts wrong. I think it would like more helpful if you didn't use any hearts in this part of the lesson. With that all said thank you for taking the time to read my review!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a fun app. It's helping me to brush up on the languages I'm not fluent in. There are incentives and competitions, and these make me more inclined to tune in often. Thanks for making the basics accessible around the world! I've heard a lot of hype about Duolingo Math and Duolingo Music. I'm unable to access these. It may be a geographical issue or an Android issue; some app developers forget that most people around the world use Android."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"1. This rating is for the new layout. It sucks and ruined my pace. If it isn't broken don't fix it. 2. Doesn't explain why something's wrong instead just memorize what ""they say"" and believe that it is the correct way. 3. The exp. boost that I get after completing a set of lessons disappear if there was a boost that expired during the completion of the last lesson."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have family that live in Netherlands but my wife doesn't know the language and I speak it just a little. While i can relearn it while there (listening and talking), we both use this to learn the language and I help her with some of the pronunciation. We have the premium version to remove the ads but as a whole, this is a very efficient and effective app and strongly recommend it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"As always, at the beginning it was easy and fun. After an update my progress was lost and their format changed. Should have kept it as it was! I don't think I'll keep using it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This is app is great! however the voice recognition software is awful and does not pick you up clearly especially when you are saying a singel word like ""hi"" & ""bye"" in whichever languge you have chosen and there is no easy way to contact customer support for feedback about these issues. Also for english learners from the Uk the preset english is American which causes issuses as it makes use of words not used in uk for exmpl you have to say soccer and cell phone where we use football and mobile."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,it's a really good and funny app for learning no bored while learning I highly recommend it what make it more valuable is you can choose any language that your interested in learning I personally like how they always remind me when am about to forget that I should take a quick lesson you deserve 5 üåü
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good for learning basics, but 6 take the time to tell you why certain sentence structures have the tense they do or why one case of the word works more than a different one. There is a serious lack of explanation, which makes it harder to form your own sentences. It's just memorizing instead of utilizing lessons taught like how a normal class setting would conduct itself."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have been using Duolingo for a few years and I enjoy the gamefication of learning a language. They really care about how even the free version works for everyone and are constantly upgrading and crowdsourcing to make it a better product. Highly recommend as a fun and effective way to learn a new language. Just know that you have to put in a little bit of effort every day to see improvement...it doesn't work without you giving a tiny bit of time every day.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Lately, the app has been working very bad. Background music from ads, without the ads showing up. Tried to reinstall but it's always the same. I try to do a lesson, the music from an ad starts, I can't see the add but tye lesson has started. And I can't close the ad because, well, there's no ad, just it's musicsounding until I close the app completely. Extremely annoying."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Great game but they enact a kind of points communism where if you really EXCEL at Duolingo, they punish you for it. Also pretty woke. The last couple updates have made the app much worse in recent years. Lesson quality and convenience is way down. I would NEVER pay for this."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"There's tons of reviews about the language learning stuff, but I just gotta add that I absolutely love the avatar options they keep adding! As soon as I started duolingo, I wanted to make myself in the style of the characters. I was delighted when they added the option, and they keep expanding the selection! It really makes me want to participate in leaderboards and add my friends!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The incentive not to lose your daily streak means that you get regular practice and it really does help not to have days away from learning. It is working for me. Shame there are no talking exercises for Gaelic yet.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Previously I gave it 2 stars, but now I'm dropping it to 1. Ever since the last update it simply isn't counting. I have never missed a single day, and yet it keeps telling me I'm skipping days and using up my freeze streak. I don't know how it could mess that up but yesterday I did 2 lessons and it still counted as not being done and told me to spend money on gems to keep my streak from being lost today."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app was never great as far as offering guidance and clarification for learning. I used to rely on comments when I needed them and was grateful they were available as a resource. They really helped fill the gap where Duolingo fell short. Now comments are no longer part of the app, there has never been a ""Back"" option for questions, which would be helpful, and now, more often than not, Duolingo doesn't even provide the written answer, just ""Great Job!"". Wouldn't say the same for the app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,When I just started using the app I was thrilled and amazed by it. I started learning several courses at the same time. But I'm not very happy with the recent updates. In the Dutch course they removed grammar which was quite helpful. Also in all my courses I don't find an option of discussion anymore. The last drop was a complete change of the Italian course. The last three units that were supposed to be synchronized with my progress turned out to be 90% unfamiliar to me.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I came across this app and thought I'd give it a try. it's fantastic, definitely helps with trying to grasp a new language. Only problem is after free trial I'm expected to pay a full yearly subscription, I just wish they did it pay monthly or quarterly. I'd definitely do it, I just can't afford the full fee at once. I can't be the only person to feel that way!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app that both supported & and encouraged learning, while promoting stretch targets. Loved it and the stories & podcasts too! New observation - The ""update"" removes many of the best features (podcasts, speaking & listening, stories), has annoying ads, and disrupts the learning process."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"LOVE IT!!! It's easy and fun to use. The new features with friends and friend quests are fun. I can pick my quest partner, which is great because some friends don't do duolingo, and then you end up doing all of the work. I'm also very competitive, so I love the leagues. Overall, it's a great a great app, and I strongly recommend getting it. Could you add more features to friends? Like the option to make and join private leagues, maybe?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very helpful for learning a language. I would recommend more specific lessons on sound pronunciation, since it took me nearly 2 years to figure out how 'ich' was pronounced."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great fun way to learn a lot of languages, all the competitiveness and just the satisfaction of getting a perfect lesson I really nice. I love that they also give free duolingo super trials when you use the app a lot. I really hope they keep that up. Overall I think that this is a really effective way to learn languages! Its just that I took 1 star because it only gives you 5 lifes each day before you need to wait for the next day."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Tried getting back into it for the new year after not using it for a few years. My review from January 2020 is exactly what I was going to say today. I learn nothing. The only thing is now I don't know where the comment section is. PREVIOUS REVIEW FROM 1/2020: I don't feel like I'm actually learning. There aren't many actual lessons with explanations and you get the most help from the comment section. I'm searching for an app that will actually teach me.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"losing a streak always makes me lose all motivation to keep learning, so probably not the best way to learn. lost a 100+ day streak and seeing it go back to single digits made me quit learning for about two years. the strange way vocab is broken up also makes it very difficult to learn how to speak a full sentence. i've completed hundreds of lessons and still haven't been taught the words for left or right"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Fun way to learn at home, the rewards make it feel like a game. I'm refreshing my skills and hoping to expand them. It might be more difficult to learn a new language on Duolingo than one you've already learned some, the lessons are kind of sporadic. Still a fun way to test your skills and memorize words/phrases. I don't know if anyone reads these, but it would be cool to see Urdu offered on Duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App OK for writing/listening but not for speaking - it isn't accurate on pronunciation; not ideal if you are learning a tonal language. And its very US-biased. The main reason for the 1-star review though is I have been charged a whole year's subscription but I cancelled the day before my trial ended. Google just keep saying its not in their policy to refund me, even though I contacted them within 24 hours of the trial ending. I feel completely scammed and warn anyone off the free trial üò°"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I use Duolingo on my Android phone and also on my iPad to learn Ukrainian. Basically DL is great, but with some reservations. The IOS version works fine but on Android there are some bugs which I have reported but never had any comeback. So user support is terrible. There are also some inconsistent lessons in Ukrainian e.g. make and female voices pronounce things differently, some answers are definitely wrong but remain uncorrected and voice recognition is patchy."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Buggy and frustrating. Some phrases in courses translated absolutely wrong. Useless and absolutely unstructured theory chunks with little to know grammar knowledge and some resemblance of order in them. You won't learn language with this app, you will learn basic phrases and that's it. Save your time and go get yourself some phrasebook, you'll get the same result."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I dread every update. The latest one took away the guidebooks from the past. I don't remember the grammar rules and I can't go back to review them. There aren't explanations or discussions you can refer to. The only thing keeping me from deleting the app is how much time I've put in. I can't spend any less time on it. A previous update annoyed me so much I only do one lesson a day.

For example I'm learning French and I keep having problems with words like ""habite/habites"" and I'll either pass or fail the question and still not know what I did right or wrong."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"You need to be quite smart if you want to learn a language correctly with this app. Many of the translations are vague so you have to guess and remember the exact meaning in order to learn a language effectively. Secondly, there are rarely explanations as far as the grammar side of learning a language is concerned. I am not a big fan of grammar but some more grammar should be added because it can help to facilitate systematic learning. The pros are the capabilities of the AI powering the app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've used this app for 5 years. It used to be great. The new update, with the heart system, made it suck and detrimental to learning. I have no desire to even use it now. I'm looking for a different app. And every character is gay for some reason. Less than 10% of the world is gay, but 90% are in Duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is fine, but it has some huge problems. When I see a duolingo advertisement, the characters are always moving. I downloaded the app and the characters Do Not MOVE! FIX IT !!!! And also, why the fish do WE ALL have a limit of 5 mistakes? The best part of LEARNING is making mistakes and fixing them!! How unfair. üò†üò°. And also I congratulated players more than 5 times and I still don't have the cheerleader award. What did I do to deserve that?! Also FIX the vocal exercises!"

There is no button to delete the account, and no easily accesible way to get to support."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"been using this app sporadically since 2016 (on a 200+ day streak rn). i dont have many complaints other than that sometimes learning with it doesnt feel dyslexia friendly. i get frustrated with myself when i burn through the 5 hearts given to me over small mistakes, which then doesnt put me in the mood to purchase/practice/watch an ad for more hearts. its more than a bit discouraging at times. i also find the whole leaderboard stressful, wish it was optional üòµ‚Äçüí´"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a overall good app good lessons and all, but there is the problem with the app not saving what I've done. It happened a couple times and it normally goes; I do a lesson or two to continue my streak, I leave the app to do my work, I come back to see that my last two lessons haven't been saved at all, however my lives are still the amount it was after the lessons. So I wouldn't have enough lives to redo the lessons, and I loose the streak. You need to fix the bugs, or I might just go."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Starts off fun, but I am so tired of being reprimanded for Grammar that they don't even tech you, just expect you to know. No matter how many times you report a question wrong, you still have to enter the false information to pass the lesson. An entirely free program to learn a language on, and I still feel ripped off."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The gamification and social aspects have much more potential that would make it a lot more engaging. Would love it if they improved the social elements - like leaderboards with friends only or the ability to compete/converse with friends learning the same language. The constant upselling and meaningless rewards are also annoying - makes it hard to want to do more than the bare minimum.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Its a good app for learning. I like the speaking and listening part. The written part is not good. Not very fair to someone with dyslexia to expect them to try and spell foreign words to pass. Have you tried spelling ""entshuldigant - excuse me"" after only just hearing/reading it. I wish there was a way to turn off the spell check part. Other than that, pretty good."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"best app to use our time effectively unlike social media, the UI characters and system is good but i hope they provide more written grammar and reasons, thanks for your effort!"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app for beginners who are deep intrested in learning such beautiful languages.Only Disadvantage here is they don't show how to pronounce it properly, Despite from this everything is top class and Duolingo's lesson's consistency is unmatched:;"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Really nice app for learning non Indian languages(im Russian learner) ... I don't understand that why does duolingo doesn't see opportunity to get into more Indian languages like Tamil ,telgu, kannad, Punjabi Bengali etc As we can see people from another states when migrate to southern states generally faces difficulty due to language including discrimination , so they are forced to learn these language , so it would be much better if they themselves learn these language as side hobbie by duo.."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"They really bombard you and try to annoy you into buying their premium plan. The content is good and useful for learning but after nearly every section you complete you get an ad to buy the premium and it gets really tiring. They also use a heart system so if you make 5 mistakes you again get prompted to buy premium and is another annoying thing. Though you can use practice lessons to gain hearts again, it's still annoying."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. It's fun, and it pushes me to do better so i can get promoted.. but there's one big issue.. on my korean course on the 2nd unit, the sound is really bad. It glitches and cuts off words where you can barely recognize what you're listening to, and sometimes it just randomly sounds like a creepy old lady and freaks me out, lmao. Hope you get it fixed soon, duo. I'll stop practicing korean until then."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I wish there was a way to record the total number of words you've learnt in a course, otherwise a really exceptional application! One less star because I noticed only iPhone users get all the updates so there's a lot of features I don't get to use e.g. podcasts, math and music course, etc. I think it's unfair, as I even have Super Duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duo lingo provides a very easy way to learn a language. Being consistent is important to learn a language. Duo makes this easy with reminders and streak challenges. The AI power used by Duo helps to make it an individual learning experience. Usually when we learn a language, pronunciation is the challenge but Duo constantly provides opportunities for good pronunciation. Mistakes can be corrected and relearned. I love Duo!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have been using this app for about 190 days learning Spanish. considering no previous education in this language, the application has a lot to offer and I've managed to get by in Spanish on my holiday. the locals appreciated my efforts and it was an awesome experience to put things to a test. I am looking forward to progressing further and I genuinely believe that once I finish the exercises available - I'll be pretty much capable of communicating without any issues. awesome!"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I have been loving the Duolingo app. I found it very useful when traveling in France and am now learning German for a future trip. One issue I have is that I don't seem to have full functionality. I have never had friends quests despite having the newest version and many mutual friends.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it's good, I've learn Japanese before but learning in duolingo is much funner, ouh and Duolingo, when you ask question like "" have you learn Japanese before?"" and started asking question..Well my suggestion is to ask the learner whether they know some of the hiragana or katakana..if they knew it, you can easily put some of the character (the cartoon) named in Katakana..*this is just an expression üòΩ‚ù§Ô∏è..LOVE FROM A JAPANESE LEARNER!

"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The ai voices are hard to handle. The sales style is incredibly pushy. I'm not proficient in french to speak to the quality of the education. Good for 5 minute breaks. Bad for anything else.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"A great app for self directed learning and solo practice. I have been learning G√†idhlig for a year now and I only really have one complaint, that is some of the audio samples are pretty inconsistent. I am also very upset and disappointed that there is no Afrikaans course. There is no way of expressing interest in unavailable languages. I'll sadly be leaving Duo to do my language learning in a place that has both options. Goodbye 371 day streak o7."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Bloomin brilliant, short, fun exercises for whichever language I want to learn. In the French ones sometimes they don't tell me what the translation is when I've completed an exercise, if I've guessed, at times this can be frustrating. Hence 4 not 5 stars. Fantastic resource though! Thank you whoever is behind this! üëå‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very beneficial for short bursts of studying. Get real time feedback. Are able to practice reading, writing, and speaking the language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's fun. It is a great resource. To get the most out of it, I recommend trying to figure out each sentence before looking at the word bubbles. Also, when it gives you the option to make it harder, do. And try and understand as much as you can by ear. If you do that it's a great tool to add in into your language learning too kit. Remember though, learning a language will always take time and effort, but you can do it. And this crazy owl will help."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is great if you're competitive. I keep coming back to study more and more so I get the top ranks in my league. I also love that you can win badges + achievements. But I almost won all, and I'm still on the first section (Pls add more). There are a few things making learning difficult: 1. Not having a word bank for each unit. Reviewing/practice doesn't cover ALL vocab. 2. Lessons aren't clear enough on what is being taught. 2 lessons will have the same title but fail to differentiate."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Really great way to dive into a language. I've been using Duolingo for years now and it helped me learn two languages already! However, you must put some effort outside of the app in order to really improve. But Duolingo gives a really solid base. Also, the app constantly improves. UI updates, more grammar explanations and language course updates come regularly. Never seen a bad update. There is also very low incentive to go premium, which i find very nice. 5/5 and recommended it to many friends"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Originally rated this app 5 stars. Played for almost a month and it was so much fun. Last week, something changed. I can't progress because I need gems to complete challenges etc. I complete lessons/earn achievements, but never get the gems or achievements added. After every step, an ad will start. I sit through ads and never get gems. I finish lessons and it's like the ad starts and blocks the gems being awarded. Sometimes closing/ reopening or uninstallingl reinstalling helps, but not much"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo helps me build my confidence in speaking foreign language, and out of nowhere i become more fluent in speaking english, the vocabulary which i often forget when having interview suddenly pops out of my mind and i get pass the test! Thank you Duolingo!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is handy to pop into for a 10 minute session wherever you are, but also good for longer sessions. Recommend upgrading to Super Duolingo as it makes thinks easier and smoother in your learning. I cannot afford it, being unemployed, so use the free version with 5 hearts/lives/allowed mistakes, which is tiring but needs must."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"well this is a great app to check your learning score , daily reminder and listening experience also your report card and how much progress you have done I will give this four because of continuous advertisement of Duolingo premium so overall it's best for your own good and also for beginners"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app has a problem where they try to do a leaderboard with people learning different languages, and then does a timed lesson where you are required to write 10 sentences in the span of less than 2 minutes. I understand the ""XP"" part of learning, but it sucks where I have to spend gems that I earned for days of learning to lose them all on trying to do something near impossible for me at my skill level. This app is for learning languages to show off."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It really helps you learn, and the layout and characters are just fun times and good vibes all around. Would recommend."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am learning with Duolingo for only some weeks, but this online place gives me soooo much opportunity to learn more than 50 words per day and make my learning more interesting, fun and easy. I also recommend everyone, a new learner, to prefer Duolingo. I would also thank Duolingo to support me and encourage me for my learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Would be giving this more stars if there wasn't a big glitch with speaking exercises within the Android 12 update. Can't do them anymore which is a big part of learning for me. It's only been the past week but if this doesn't get fixed, I will cancel my sub. Also prefer the original app to their current updates. Also wish it would start with basics like numbers, he/she, body parts, colours, just as you would in school, rather than jumping into full sentences that aren't used in daily speaking."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've used this app for years. It is very much a pay-to-play type of deal. The app does not function as intended if you're not willing to pay a monthly fee. Which I've never been willing to pay. Learning should be free. Not costing you a minute in between lessons, where most of the lessons that you complete, are not actually tracked in any of your learning progress."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Was great. Suddenly super predatory. I have found the speed challenges to be an excellent way to get in a lot of repetition and memorization, and it has been a great motivator to learn and play consistently. The new Match Game speed challenge is ABHORRENT. It is impossible to play without dumping large quantities of in-game currency into it. And there is no option to play any other speed challenge mode."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,this app is really fun and enjoyable. It has very few ads and is free. It asks you what level you are in the language you want to speak. It makes learning a new language very easy and works on it with you step by step.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Duolingo used to be a great app but the new owners don't care about their users. They have removed functionality without replacing it via other methods. eg grammar discussions and pronunciation for every word. Hopefully it will get handed back to the previous owners. The current ones are terrible and are destroying any value that it had.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app that doesn't subtract from user experience for monetary gain; ads are controlled, and they even will give you free premium occasionally. They also deliver on their promise to give you a decent proficiency in writing, understanding and speaking any number of languages. It's worth noting that you'll still require external learning to become fluent."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app. Great for learning. Doesn't feel like much at first, but you'll get used to it. The one thing that's keeping me from a 5-Star rating is... Why can't I access the Math and Music courses? Either it's a thing for Android users or it's just me, but I'm looking in the courses section and no ""New Courses"" tab under the language courses. Other than that, it's a good language learning experience overall. I was gonna do something for the memes but not enough space :( 4/5"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I don't like the amount of hearts the users get. I want to learn a language and not worry that I'm gonna make a mistake... The rest is really great though. I like (besides the heart part) how the app is designed to feel like a game. Makes it nicer to learn.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love the app and characters and the tiktok is what got me to download it (again) but the fact that now there's a limited amount of mistakes you can make and the only why to get more is to pay is honestly a bit upsetting since it wasn't like that before and it makes doing the lessons a bit more stressful then I think it should be. Also doulingo the bird on tiktok is absolutely hilarious and should wear more weird costumes :)
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a really good language app, with or without the super learner ""premium."" However, I just with I could buy 2x exp from the shop. That's my only complaint. It's pretty hard to get 2x exp when you aren't doing it with friends, so I think that adding to the shop would be helpful and needed."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It is great to learn another language but It gives you constant reminders and forces you to learn it. I am sick of the constant reminders when I'm out with my family üò≠üò≠
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good foundation for learning languages. The path update means things aren't repeated enough for me to fully learn them, plus there's not enough activities that make you think for yourself rather than tapping bubbles, so my progress has stalled a lot. Still, I'm happy with what I've learnt over a few years. Definitely can't fully learn a language on here, but with Clozemaster, watching Spanish YouTubes/Netflix shows, and chatting on Babbel Live/iTalki, it's a great base."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"its awesome. I like the way Duo gets mad and makes a face when you don't take your lessons for a while. I like the emotional black -mail ( üòÇ you see what I did there) that I receive, it makes me to take my lessons, though I'm not easily blackmailed buh this one I welcome. if you could make all the lessons to have audio, it'd be best for pronunciation purposes. bravo team"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have always wanted to learn French but I never had the time to go to lessons but now I can just sit back and do my lesson! another good thing about Duolingo is that it's so fun they weren't kidding when they said it was like a game, Duolingo has motivated me to keep my streak thriving and making me really want to learn French, there's almost no ads which I think is wondering and it makes it even easier to learn the language of your choice! I 100 percent recommend bonne journ√©e!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Only room for cons. I'm learning Korean and I've noticed a lot of typos. For example, during a lesson, it showed Í∑∏Îü∞Îç∞ as georeonde, when it's GEUreonde. Geo is Í±∞ and geu is Í∑∏; they have two different meanings, so it can be confusing at times. The robotic voice also mispronounces, cuts off words, or is even so distorted that you can't tell what's being said. And most importantly, a few people have mentioned the app can teach an informal word/sentence that others may find offensive in that culture."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,So grateful to have this app and forever will be happy to learn more language in the future. Nothing I could ask for more how I wish I could spend some for premium coz it is truly worth it especially when someone is really passionate and serious to learn a new language. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love Duolingo there is a streak to maintain,and you do lessons to get xp and at the end of the week you can advance up to the next league, but in the lesson if you get a question wrong you lose a heart, and if you lose all your hearts you can't finish your lesson unless you use gems to get more hearts, but you can buy super Duolingo in the app and you get unlimited hearts and no ads, there isn't much ads tho, it looks like it is designed to learn off your mistakes and memorize words ."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app decreases the volume of any other media coming from the device whenever it plays sound, making it unusable with music. As the short lections are otherwise optimal for being done during commute, please also allow for blocking out chatter through music/white noise without the bothersome reduction in volume. As always, making this an optional setting would be most appreciated."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I originally reviewed early in and gave 5 stars, now later I believe it is 4 stars. The guidebook seems very heavily underdeveloped. It doesn't seem to explain rules exactly for your language or go into too much detail. The new pathway structure is extremely boring and repetitive. Bugs seem to be more common now It would be nice as you develop your skill, to be able to convert the app language into your learning language and be able to press the words for translation, a more complex learning"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have an 1100 day streak and have loved using Duolingo for about 4 years now. I think it is a fun, engaging, game-like way to learn Spanish grammar and vocabulary. I can read and write much better. But I am still unable to hold a live conversation with a native speaker. I think it is not the best way to learn to do that, but it may provide a helpful prior foundation for use of other platforms that DO exercise real-time listening & responding aloud in a real-life context. I am going to try this."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love the app as an educational tool, but it keeps freezing. Every time I have to restart my phone. Also the ads are a bit too annoying ( I don't mind some ads... but). Finally I get the game-ifying addict but telling you you've run out of hearts and there's a possibility you might not be able to finish the lesson send counter- productive ti me. In spite of all this I would give it 5 stars of it stopped freezing!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This used to be the best language learning app. Now it's just a money grabber. They claim they have a ""mission"" to improve language learning, while that may have been the case, now their only mission is getting your cash. They remove features, keep bombarding you to sign up to their super service then make it almost impossible to use the free version with the stupid hearts thing."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"duolingo keeps changing for the worse. removing their grammar explanations that help make sense of complex language structures (Hungarian), removing the forum that was basically explaining a lot of grammer that they didnt on specific examples, and now changing their paths I was progressing through so works I already learned are marked as new and words I've never seen are considered learned by the app? Where's our vocab list? I'm only using it at this stage as none other covers Hungarian it seems"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,If it's a typing part of the lesson I lose a heart if I misspelled a word even if I was really close to the word. But overall it's a great learning resource to learn a language.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is an incredible platform to learn a foreign language. It's fun and easy, and the reminders are just pushy enough to get you going. I am SO happy with this app and I would highly recommend it."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Updates to the app somewhat replace the old NCIKU resource for drawing characters in hanzi, really incredible for learning Chinese, as well as Hindi, Cyrillic, and more. Great job Duo! Kept me studying for years when I couldn't afford tutors or classes. Kept up with duolingo and lost nothing from my formal education. I am always learning and have been able to impress many friends abroad. All it needs is a messaging system so I can chat with other students! Would love to see more writing systems!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,it is a very good way to teach English. I suggest the users to install this app and learn speaking English . this is the best way to teach children also. l had used this app and my English speaking skills also developed.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Honestly I wish there was an option to watch ads to refill hearts as one of the options. but there isn't really. it's frustrating when you're on the last correction or question for a daily lesson and it makes you start over because you picked the singular article instead of the plural, especially when it's an ambiguous sentence. it discouraged free users from learning. otherwise great app though."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo always did a piss poor job at explaining grammar, but people on the discussions did an invaluable job covering for it and I learned a lot thanks to them. It was a great (and absolutely necessary) complement to how the app works. But you guys are complete idiots and removed the discussions altogether, so this app is completely useless now. Removing the option to manually write answers was already a stupid move, but this is the stroke that broke the camel's back. Uninstalled."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have had Duolingo for many years and up until now, Duolingo was pretty perfect. The newest update has completely ruined the app. Now, instead of getting the choice of whether you have unlimited hearts or 5 hearts, you can only have 5. If you get 5 mistakes in one lesson, then you have to wait to get more hearts to do a lesson and continue your streak. To get each level to legendary, you have to pay with gems. The only way you can get these things back is with premium. Please fix this issue."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is a good app, I am learning Spanish. what I don't like about it is that sometimes it freezes and I'll have to quit and start again. At other times it will change a word; such as pen, boligrafo is the word I was learning and then all of a sudden it changed to Pluma so I got it wrong. it never introduced the word pluma to me before hand nor did it explain why there was another version nor when to use it. Irritating!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a fun way to improve a new language you're already learning using more traditional methods like books, with grammar, spelling, sentences. It helps you learn new words, but not necessarily how to use them and construct a proper sentence. Or at least not during the first few stages.... Update: duo isn't registering my completed quests!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,it's a very good app for learning new languages I was loading Korean just for my knowledge it was very helpful and it was like a game I give it only 4 stars because it teachers bit very slow as an already know it but also it ask the same question again and again so it's a bit slow going I want it to start from my level I don't understand how to do it please help for this but also it's a very good app for learning new languages if you want to learn any language please download it's very helpful

I like that they added a Kanji learning section, but I think it could be a little better if they had whole word practice, not just single character.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a decent tool however it has a number of issues. I am learning Portuguese and some words which should be interchangeable are not accepted. There are also multiple instances where you are expected to figure out proper useage and syntax on your own, despite the guide book existing to teach this. I would also like to see a word list with translations and pronunciations for learnt words. I have a few other small issues but being the only notable app for learning languages, I will still use it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Prior technical glitch has been fixed and this app keeps getting better, I subscribed and don't regret it - a great companion to your education in a new language. While it does test your speaking skills, I've yet to find a better substitute then working with a native speaker so push yourself to talk or youll just understand a lot but never communicate."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"In general not really the best way to learn the language as there is lack of explanations, some sentences that are completely useless (with mouses and bears and so on) in reality and on top of that translations aren't always 100% accurate. There should be much more speaking and reading than just the grammar. Plenty of room for improvement."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it's perfect for me. I got a two day streak on this app! because while you're learning it actually listens to you,so I can keep getting better at Japanese! it's like there's an actual teacher in front of you.‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great app. learning 4 languages. it's difficult when it needs to be and challenging and fun which is quite hard to achieve in alot of language learning apps. and unlike other language learning apps I can still learn the whole language without needing a subscription and the ads don't get in the way too much. even though its free the subscription does help a ton. but not to the point where you are forced to buy it. perfectly balanced thanks duo!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I think it's good quite a variety of languages you can learn. It's entertaining but can get boring at times also you have to use different emails to learn more than one language and I don't have two emails so I couldn't make another profile and couldn't find out how to delete the old one. Overall good it also has a learn the alphabet thing as well which is very useful something that not many other language apps have. üëç
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"There are many things wrong with Duolingo. The first is the constant ask for money. The biggest thing wrong with it is the ""teaching"" approach. There is no list of vocabulary, or pronunciation guide for the transliterations, so you just have to guess what the words mean. The animations are childish and have nothing to do with the lessons. It would be much better if the pictures had something, anything, to do with what's being taught. I've used many systems to learn languages. This is awful."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,its pretty good you have to answer mini questions to build your vocabulary but the main issue is the speaking part sometimes i feel its hard to make it hear right because i know what im saying and it doesnt regester and iblose hearts other than that though its really good

(Honestly I don't remember seeing it at all, just monthly pricing in bold and then what it would be equal to at 12 months, nowhere did it say one payment) Unfortunately I can't cancel sooner but I can be sure not to give you more in the future. Being clear earns respect, not being tricky."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I cancelled my trial of super duolingo but was still charged for a year's subscription anyway. Immediately tried to cancel but this doesn't seem to be possible - and can't see a way to contact duolingo through the app. Have requested Google play to refund but they have refused even though it's within 48 hours of being charged. Previously enjoyed the app but this has left a very unpleasant impression.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The app is very good but it keeps freezing. It is very frustrating that I have needed to uninstall and then reinstall the app multiple times. Each time I seem to lose any credit for the work I have done. Unfortunately it seems to be getting worse and I have reinstalled multiple times this week. If I was not learning so much from it I would have given up long ago.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is pretty ok. It stands out for learning by spaced repetition. However, it does not include any grammar and features to organize vocabulary. It does not connect with any material from ""real"" world. It works by offering ""canned"" phrases that allows you to learn in a limited context."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I've loved duo for over a year now. Something broke in the last couple weeks where sending a double XP boost to a challenge partner won't work. It takes the 20 gems from my balance to send the boost and they get the boost notification but it simply won't activate the boost bonus. I've sent an email regarding this to support with no response that I've seen yet. Edit: An update has fixed the double XP issue but I never heard back from support so I adjusted my review to 4 stars.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Really good, alright before updates, but with an up to date phone, this app has some great variety, even without the paid version. you can draw the hiragana now, which is personally a very appreciated feature. (Before you could draw them, but it actually stops showing you how to write the letter bit by bit to help get you to full memorisation.)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It is a supplement for your language learning, but by no means replaces a more ""traditional"" approach. A feature of showing a literal word by word translation irrespective of grammar and/or cultural context is missing too, the currentlessons feel too much like a phrasebook. I would also prefer a bit more emphasis on _formal_ grammar. The line breaks in the Korean course are still arbitrary. With the previous proper explanation it was a language course - now it is just a glorified phrasebook."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have done duo for a long time and if you don't have super duo then it's hard to advance because your limited to your mistakes. But I personally don't recommend duo because the sentences are really random and hard to interpret into English and to be honest some of their answers make me wonder if they don't just make stuff up sometimes. Some things,most things make absolutely no sense and you have to add words to make the sentence make sense literally guessing . Now I'm being overcharged by 2$."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is a very good app. The aspect of spaced learning is what I enjoy the most because it ensures that you don't easily forget what you've learnt overtime. In general it's a good app
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm learning Spanish through the app and English is my 2nd language. I rlly like duolingo to START learning a NEW language, but I hate it for practicing my English, bc the most part of the exercises r to translate something,and in my opinion translating isn't very effective or useful, considering that what rlly matters is if the grammar is correct and if u understand the meaning of the words. I'd like the app had a option to turn off the translating exercises. Also, very hard to gaim gems!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm having a problem with performing any lesson at all... for the last 7 days I've been trying to do any lesson, but the app seemed to be broken or has a bug effecting it.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,its a great app for learning all kind of languages but sometimes there's been some audio able problems but no problem because in the last lessons all things are cleared and now for me its really very easy to learn all .
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoy learning on Duolingo. It seems fun and effortless, yet already I've come a long way. It also compliments my Spanish night class lessons, nicely."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Recent changes are making me downgrade my rating. One, I didn't like when they changed things to a ""single path"". Two, I set the app to remind me to practice at 4pm -- but it doesn't until after I'm asleep at 10. Three, the bugs, in particular answers already filled in. I flagged them but I've given up, since nothing changes. Fourth and apparently the last straw: I changed my profile picture to their ""avatar and now it won't let me change it back!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am using Duolingo to brush up on my French and to learn Scottish Gaelic. I have a pretty strong basis in French. I was in French immersion throughout elementary school, and then took advanced French classes in junior high, but have neglected to use my French for many years. This app has been great at reconnecting those dormant neural pathways. I'm picking it back up very quickly. Learning Gaelic with very little background has been going really well too. My vocabulary is growing quickly!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This isn't my first or I my only language app I've frequented which, I think really helps my approach. I've sorta come to the conclusion that learning & memorizing take a lot of repition so it's fun that there is multiple avenues of incentive & overall isnt overwhelming to come back to after walking away from. Dropping a star since having to dismiss my mistakes or my progress because of the lack of clarification in rules or in writing some translations. Removing the forum recently, a loss for me"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Paid for the Super Family Plan but can't use it offline. There's still an article dated 2017 on DL website which states: ""Luckily, Duolingo Plus, our subscription option, allows users to download lessons for offline use. You can download lessons and practice sessions in advance to learn without an internet connection. Your progress is uploaded once you go back online, so you can keep your precious streak!"" Clearly this is no longer the case and should be made obvious. Don't see why this is so."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Initially, I didn't want to rate Duo, but then, they updated the app to include many more features recently; so I must say Duolingo is THE BEST. NIGERIANS and friends all over the world!... you've gat to try Duolingo üòä However, there's still room for improvements, and for making Duo the best of the bests, and one of them is including Thai amongst the languages that one can learn. Secondly, adding Nigerian languages; very important, like Igbo, Yoruba and Hausa. Thanks for the opportunity."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"honestly, it's like a language learning game I can't get enough of. Points to score, friendly competition with buddies, and these quick lessons that squeeze into your schedule. Whether you're just starting or revisiting a language, it's spot-on. With all the languages I've learned (I'm a polyglot), those regular updates, it's always interesting. Seriously, give it a go, and you'll find yourself hooked before you know it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Easy to use, and you pick the level of difficulty you want to start on, based on your level of experience in the language you anti to learn."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm giving it a 5 star because I'm getting familiar with some words but please you guys should make it complex and avoid a lot of repetition and please include some quizzes inside so we can boost our interest quicker. I really love this technology, I'm also a computer beginner I don't know if you guys can recommend me to learn a lot from you people üôè"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's WONDERFUL except that I wish the subscriptions included a monthly charge option. I would definitely pay $10 a month for the family plan. My kids and I love it but I can't afford the $120 yearly charge.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The listening and speaking exercises are useful, something a book cannot deliver. The rest of the material is OK, introducing vocabulary and grammar by example, with reinforcing exercises. But at least with the free product, the absence of explanation and stated rules is a pity. Also there is less opportunity to skip ahead than in the previous version, so you either risk missing useful new material, or have to repeat the same exercises of supposed weak points ad nauseam, even if you ace them."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A few suggestions: -When there's a word bank give us the option to reset or rearrange words. Having to tap every word to restart the sentence is irritating. -I finished Polish last month & near the end the course the voices were switching between male & female within an individual question. I thought it was a glitch @ the end of the lesson but I've been reviewing the course and it's happening everywhere. -Completed course review lessons are stagnant & repeat the same phrases, making them useless"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Great app to catch up on your language goals, too many ads and a quite a few answers need to be updated and revised. sometimes the microphone freezes and decides to skip or gives errors in talking exercises, users for over a year should get an extra heart or two to encourage them to use the app more. [EDIT 11TH OCTOBER 2023] After 454 days of progress, suddenly the app takes me back to unit 1 and all my previous progress is gone, WTH?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good for basics and helping alongside another course. One of the things that keeps me coming back to Duolingo over other apps is the widget. I wish languages with alternate writing systems would just have their writing added to the lessons (every so many lessons you do a lesson of writing), it feels disconnected from the main learning experience. You wouldn't have to have the do writing lessons to progress gates. TLDR: widget is good, Japanese needs to have writing in the course."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it's The best app for learning √† second language . It's super fun , and engaging. Even if your struggling to find time to use the interface outside of the workplace or a church."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I am enjoying the app and I am currently taking French and I like they have a note book you can reveiw for greater comprehension befor you start the lesson. However there is not enough time in the timed challenges as the spoken parts take too long to process voices. If I skip them then I find I can complete challenges but I think the spoken exercises are valuable and should not need to be skipped to have enough time.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It starts out fine, but the more you do the less accurate it is. I even purchased a separate keyboard to do all the accents right and it still won't let me progress"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Enjoying it very much. Learning a language feels like playing a game. I'm addicted ;-) Unfortunately the loading times are insane (even with duolingo plus), so only 4/5. edit after several months of usage: going down to 3/5 as some speaking exercises are simply incorrect and bugged (spoken language not detected properly even from a native speaker). been reporting these issues for months without any improvements."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good overall, a few badly recorded listening voices, some cringey expressions noone uses are shown as well and some cringey syntax or grammar, but it's not that often, yet very very petty in that it tries to guilt trip you into spending the premium currency... üòí Finally, I have rated the app already, but I'm asked to at least once a week... Annoying..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've been on Duo since probably around 2016. Although only doing daily practice for the past year and some. The app has come a really long way. I don't think it's the best for mastering a language but it prioritizes daily practice and bite sized lessons which makes sticking to your language learning easy. I believe it is a good starting place or supplement to your language learning plans.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love love love love! Teaches me but I don't understand why you need to pay for super Duolingo...My child wants to learn Italian but he makes a lot of mistakes. The super Duolingo should be free for kids.. Like a kids Duolingo!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Good to start with but so focused on particular things that you don't get to learn new stuff. And some sentences are so repetitive I'm tired of doing the same words over and over again, I need to move on to newer words and sentences. Edit. Now constant glitches, starting to be more annoying rather than helping me to learn"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So, do you want to learn Japanese the right way? Don't bother with this app. Partitives aren't explained properly, alternate translations that are both grammatically and logically correct are accepted as a correct answer about... *checks notes* ...less than half of the time, and the response time to deal with bots and cheaters during leaderboard leagues is unacceptable. I'll be better off with some other app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,it's actually really easy to learn your language I'm learning Japanese and it's actually really fun but it's always asking me to buy and it has adds but if you don't care about the ads and sometimes it glitches but not that much then you're perfectly fine
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a very fun language-learning app. Have been using it for years and it helped me to learn my preferred foreign languages effectively yet faster and easier. It's suitable for all age range people. From students to those who are working, youngsters to elderlies, everyone can use it because it is very user-friendly. The daily reminder and streak help us to be consistent and promote a consistent learning habit. Overall, I am super satisfied with Duolingo. Great job Duolingo team!üå†"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Cool! art style is cute, format is simple and effective, however most languages are not too accurate grammar wise and it definitely needs more ""useful"" sentences. I've noticed even around course two you are still learning how to say ""the sweater is pink"", and I think there should be more things to learn that you'd actually use on a daily basis, especially for travellers. TLDR: really simple and cute app, just needs work on the phrases it gives you + grammar. 7/10, would recommend :)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it's a really good app for students, in my opinion at least, but what really annoys me is that for some reason, the leaderboard is missing and the leagues are too, and on the web version of duolingo, only the leaderboard is there but the leagues are missing also, Animations don't work for the love of anything, this really annoys me. could it be that I'm using a Huawei?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love Duolingo it's the best app for learning languages I'm learning German right now and I've been so into it I've got a 38 day streak and I got infinite hearts a free gift from Duolingo if your wanting to learn a different language this is highly recommended and you don't even need WiFi to do it! Thanks duo!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's an excellent way to learn or practice a language. The way it makes learning a game by encouraging you to keep up your streak and do challenges provides motivation and makes it addictive. The only issue is that it too often crashes when you are in the middle of a lesson, which is frustrating, and why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo has done it's best over the years to revise the way it teaches many languages. While an app cannot hope to be a replacement for real world interaction or tutors, Duo has improved and gotten myself to a higher level of fluency and vocabulary that is regularly usable. The stories are the most fun and funny, and the quick time events for vocab help with immediate callback."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,this app is nice to learn any language but there is one problem that they repeat the same question again and again. but the app is nice .my advice is you should download this is good app for learning languages.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Between 3 and 4 stars. It's good at introducing you to languages, but I think needs to be better at immersing you in a language and culture and/or be accompanied by traditional learning and speaking with others. I've done it for over a year now daily but can't say I'm much better or more confident when I go abroad. It's fun, engaging, and can be a good support to language learning, but should not be considered a magic bullet. You need to put in the hard work alongside this to learn languages."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was sceptical to start off with, but I am really enjoying using this app to learn Russian. It becomes quite addictive, but in a good way. I find it difficult to to practice daily, but duo lingo makes it easy."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Penalised for making mistakes. Pressured into paying for the premium version to avoid adverts and lose the Hearts limit. Not a good way to motivate someone who wants to learn the language.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love this app! Keeps my French sharp. Malhereusement, I can't pay monthly for super or I'd have it already. Give people options dang it! New edit: app lags considerably after completing lessons takes ages to load sometimes I need to relaunch it. I can't hear the man with the moustache clearly in French. His pronunciation is very closed and muffled. Makes it hard to get the answer correct. And is it just me or was it easier to earn gems before the big update? And not just from ads. üòÆ‚Äçüí®"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"overall I've had a decent experience with Duolingo learning Hungarian, French and Italian. Not all languages are equal as some are missing features. Sometimes I get something wrong and would like more explanation but Duolingo doesn't really give decent explanation. For what it is, it works well enough, but is just another tool towards fluency. I have reduced to two stars due to the offensive use of the American flag to depict English all over the app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"despite criticism i think doulingo made his own app unique by focusing on grammar. of course the sentences will be bad but language has always been a lifetime learning experience, hence with good grammar foundation you know what to seek in dictionary lets say to gain more vocabulary. i appreciate the stand the devs took. i do hope more languages are available for english speakers like Thai and Tamil."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app asks you to repeat phrases that try to push a specific idiology into your brain. Please try it yourself before giving it to your children. You may not agree with it. It is also too gamified. It triggers you to answer without thinking, which may or may not eventually teach you a language, but I don't feel it is working with me. It has actually become quite anoying."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is helping me reach my goals concerning learning Spanish. I grew up around it and know quite a bit but struggle a lot as a mostly native speaker in the United States so I hope to become more fluent. There is a subscription for the app but without it the ads are not intrusive or annoying at all and help make the app free for everyone!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"doulingo is fun and I'm getting good at speaking new languages üòÑ but in one ad I saw it learned math too but I can't really find if there is or not, still an amazing app tho 100% needed for someone new to a language I recommend"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm 12. and I'm learning German and Spanish. I started both about 4 days ago, and I've already learned a lot. of course, I've been doing duolingo almost all night, but that still doesn't change the fact that I'm far enough along to construct detailed sentences in German. after I finish german, I will switch back to Spanish and Russian. later, Arabic. anyways. I hope this helped! you do get some ads, but they aren't that bad, just midly annoying."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My app updated to the new version and it's horrible. There is no rhyme or reason to any of it. Impossible to go through to old lessons and review them. Lessons I've upgraded to legendary don't count for more points and make me lose hearts if I make a mistake. Absolutely horrible. As a teacher of nearly 20 years of experience, punishing mistakes while reviewing old material is the opposite of any pedagogical method. Horribly disappointed."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like this app a lot, but there are some setbacks. 1) I feel that the levels got harder, in a good way, but it also makes it tedious to finish a singular lesson, along with the monthly challenges. 2) Let's say you want to make a lesson legendary, but then you have to leave in the middle of the story (not a normal lesson). When you come back to the same screen, you can't click on any buttons, and when you try to log back in, your gems aren't returned. These are the only two setbacks."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"great app. I wish every language had stories and speaking. I'm doing 3 languages and some are definitely better than others. the competitive side os not nice. There are users that cheat, making it hard for those that don't. additionally its easier to score points quickly in certain languages and not in others, giving some an unfair advantage. this app would be better if you could compete against people doing the same language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"awesome and fun learning game! I can learn two languages at the same time! maybe even more! My one complaint is the hearts, if you make a mistake only 5 times, you have to quit the lesson and practice for 1 more. I just wish it wasn't just 5 hearts, but that is my opinion. otherwise, I would really recommend this app if you want to learn multiple languages or even just one!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"‚ô°If you want to learn English, it's easier because there is Duolingo and I really like it. If I study continuously, I can talk more easily with people and friends too, so I give it 5 points.‚ô° ‚ô°Thank you Duolingo :]‚ô°"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Without a shadow of a doubt, one of the best apps out there, but best completed in browser alongside the lessons and native language material for best effect."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoy this app. However, it sometimes annoys me. I had a 3 day super trail and on the last day I went on duolingo and did all my quests so that I had done some more for the October challenge, but a few minitues later it said my trail had ended and deleted the quests I had just done, this made me very angry. Another issue I have is that when I do a question and I put my answer it says it's wrong, but when I get the question again and put the same answer it says it's right. Please fix ."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There is an issue where it is not accepting any pronunciation I make of the word. I even tried recording the app voice saying it, which usually works, and it still isn't accepting it, saying it's not correct. It has been sitting in my mistake section for about a week or 2. Also, there needs to be a medium when the app is saying a long sentence because right now, it's either too fast or too slow."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It has the occasional glitch and lag which gets annoying. It is easy to get caught up on certain aspects of language learning. For example only doing the speaking lessons, or writing lessons, or listening lessons. I have to remind myself to practice the other types of lessons that I may not naturally gravitate towards. They could scramble the sentences a little so I am not always finding cuatrocientos pesos en el piso. Maybe I could find tres, or cinco, or seis mil pesos en el piso."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It says sophomore, freshman and what not for school years. I'm not from a country that has that, why would you use these? It makes it harder to learn when I'm learning another countries school system."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Not a bad app, but far too many adverts, which is off-putting. When learning languages that involve learning a new script, there are a lot of inconsistencies in how pronunciation is represented and causes a lot of confusion. You're not going to get very far into your language learning journey before you'll want something more in-depth and comprehensive. I know grammer can be hard and puts many off, but without understanding a little bit of it, you're never going to be great at a language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it's hit or miss, really. You either practice everyday and you maintain a momentum or you don't and then you have to catch up. For as far as the free version goes, the hearts really are an annoying factor that interferes with your momentum. But if you're dedicated enough, you can just use the mistake correction tool and gain it back. The only issue is, they use outdated language words."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I think Duolingo is the best app for learning languages. At the moment, I'm learning French because I've got French lessons in school. And this is really helpful so I don't get a bad grade. Also, Duolingo is stress-free to use (if you do your lessons..... duolingo will capture your family if you don't.....) and it's completely free, so try duolingo out yourself!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I'm really glad the words section was added. I've been wanting something added like this for so long. Now I can look up specific words I forgot or am struggling with. Still peeved about the lack of lesson freedom though.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I think this app us a great start for learning a new language, but it is definitely missing real ""lessons"" and actually teaching grammar etc. Now you just end up trying to memorise specific phrases. I dont mjnd the style updates, but I'd love to instead see some updates to the languages. I used to learn German which also have multiple stories you can practice, this gives a little bit of ""real life"" practice. However this function is not available in some languages (like Dutch and Swedish).."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"If you already have an introductory level of experience with a language, this is good practice. However, this will not teach you grammar, rules, sentence structure, or even the names of the letters. Cute, motivational challenges help gamify the learning, but you need to figure EVERYTHING out by yourself."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's an enjoyable app, I pay for the subscription as I get a lot of use out of the app with full access. The main issue I have is that sometimes the app freezes after I complete a lesson and it's been happening more and more. I also have an issue where sometimes, when it freezes, I lose progress and have to redo the lesson. it's quite upsetting."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo has improved a lot since last time I frequently used it, but still there is a lot to improve (not only the courses). Why not being able to see the words learned anymore?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"When I first downloaded it, it has a bug where it says ""let party"" and later on as I tap continue it went blank and Duo is just looking at me, I was terrified, so I told this to my brother and it continued and I was really terrified more. But at all of the happening, best friends will always be best friends! Best learning app for Languages hehe"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ads have gotten even worse. Long Ads after every lesson, even if I only take 30 seconds to finish it. You even get Ads for leaving a lesson. If you flip the sentence structure, it often won't be accepted even if your answer is grammatically correct and commonly used. Several of their Japanese lessons are incorrect. Terrible UX that's gotten worse over the years. They took out the section where you can talk about the answer so you don't know why you're wrong anymore."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I tried out duolingo 5 years ago... it was alright... I got back on and the language I was trying to learn has better lessons. I feel like the whole layout has also improved. There is always room for improvement, but I'm highly impressed for the fact that there is no mandatory charges to use the app (or website)."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"For some, maybe it's useful. At the moment, the exercises are way too easy and require nearly no cognitive effort. Thus, the learning outcome relative to invested time is very low - you just keep clinking for weeks without much thinking. This is even more apparent when you are getting interrupted by the very long ads. At the moment, given the price of the plans, you are better off attending live classes."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"hi, this app is soo good for peoples who wanted to learn new language . l am student from 5th standard. Duolingo is like a game. Feedback of these game or app:- These app is nice but you can add the grammer for English. The grammar mistake also can learn or improve in these app.See you can give example of me that last week even can't write this much English, and see now how much I have written English. Thank you that person who has invented such a amazing and nice app and gameüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love the quick little games and variety of options to practice. I also love the challenege to stay motivated. Duo's phone widget and clever notifications help as well.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The Best App For Learning New Languages, At First I was getting bored with this app but, there was something which was not letting me quit this app, I was regularly learning Korean in this app by getting it's remainder, and after using it again and again I was enjoying this, it was like an entertaining game. So I highly recommend This for learning languages‚ù§Ô∏è. Lovely App"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Not a perfect app (it doesn't explain grammar very well), but good for learning vocabulary and the gamification is good for consistently practicing"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I think Duolingo really is helpful when you're wanting to learn a new language. It gives you accurate examples and helps you greatly along the way.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"makes learning a new language fun without taking away how challenging it is. I'm learning High Valyrian right now. in the past I used this for basic intro to Thai, Japanese, Russian, Gaelic, Spanish and Mandarin. it's easy for me to retain what I've learned because the lessons are short. I can keep going if I want but I never feel overloaded with information."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The microphone won't always recognise the correct words that you speak, it's always a hit and miss. The android and ios app won't sync the early or night chests either, because the android app never got that feature despite their old comments claiming it will appear soon (it's been more than 2 years, still waiting for it). The AI throws the exactly same set of words/sentences in today's practice section. There is a pestering habit to prompt to install the other app, and showing maths and music."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Nice app but... You read about lots of new things like duo music, duo math, Duo radio, but nothing of that appears to be in the android app... Even after weeks... Even if you are subscribed... That kinda sucks, to finance the whole thing but not getting all the new features you read about... I couldn't even find a date when those new features are planned to be available on Android"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, rubbish without super duolingo, and you have to pay for that. The annoying thing is, me and my sister were on a super family plan, and then one day, I just got randomly kicked off it, but she's still got super, but I don't..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoy this app, however it definately lacks overall as a single source for language learning. This application also has several inconsistencies and bugs between the mobile and browser versions. I don't feel the value for a paid membership is reflected through the additional features provided. I would classify this as a tool for running vocabulary drills as a language learning aid. I love using Duolingo but as a paying user most of my language learning happens elsewhere FREE!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,highly recommended for everyone who's looking for learning different languages in simple and Easy way with fun revision reading listening options.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Best language learning app I've used. Would like to see more languages though. Free version is not overly disrupted by ads or limited in function.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app,it helps me learn so quick,and even though I'm no way near done,it feels like I'm really learning Russian! I done quite like that premium features include things that are so helpful for a price,but I understand it,because a free app needs to make money somehow. thank you duolingo for helping me in my journey to being fluent in Russian! [side note: please don't kill me if I lose my streak duo I would prefer to be alive for a little longer]"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Knocked off a star because the app claims to teach you a foreign language when it does not. It does not teach you grammar rules or exceptions. This app is excellent for practice and expanding your vocabulary outside of a classroom and is very fun to use. It helps out greatly when you don't have anyone to actually speak to in the language that you are trying to learn.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Love learning in Duolingo - edited well that was when I started. Since then they have destroyed the app and learning experience. Go for Babble or something else now. The Duo people don't listen to the users at all..the path system is a complete failure. Many people use an older version of the app but I can't even get that working so goodbye Duo
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"They force you to watch ads, with poor pronouncing and giving a right answer wrong. some times both the options have same prunounciation or different prunounciation then the learning lessons."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Yeah it is cool but it does take time and I mean time. I've been on it for about 2 months now and have only learned to build small sentences in French. Though if you take it seriously and practice for 2-3 hours a day you can probably learn to be fluent or near fluent in around 2-4 months unlike me who uses it 45 minutes a day. I would not really recommend Super Duolingo or Duolingo Pro but if you are not patient to regain your hearts then go for it. Thank you for your time.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been learning with Duolingo for more than 500 days. It used to be much better. They had a forum for discussions but shut it down. There also used to be explanations to expressions, exceptions and grammar. It's also gone. They push you towards the Plus plan (paid), which I tried several times, but it doesn't get any better. Overall, Duolingo is very basic. I'd be willing to pay if it was better"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like the new look and the progression. It really feels more like a game than a learning app. You're not gonna become fluent only using the app. Once you get to a comfortable point, make sure to listen to music, podcasts, youtube videos, etc, in the language you're learning and find a practice buddy from the r/duolingo subreddit Language is only half the battle. We need a duolingo history/culture app to really drive that nail through the coffin!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"an excellent application for retaining knowledge of foreign languages. Has to be improved when non English speakers use the English platform to practice another language, as usually direct connection between non English mother language and non English learning language is not offered."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I like the concept of the app. However, the app is so slow. Takes forever to load in between screens, functions, and takes a while for jt to load the words I say via voice. This app needs to be optimized much better. I don't know how many times I say exactly what it says and it doesn't load and after three times it says let's come back to this one. Mean while people looking at me weird because I'm screaming into my phone. Very frustrating. About to Uninstal it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app suddenly went unavailable due to maintenance and I lost my exp potion, and they didn't give any compensation for inconvenience. Even freemium mobile games give compensation. The app is repeatedly not properly giving me rewards for finishing the daily quests The app crashes frequently, especially speaking exercises (it's a bug, not connection issues). Sometimes it can even lag when displaying advertisements. Extremely annoying when trying to maximize double exp bonus usage."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoy this format, I'm starting as a complete beginner and need a LOT of repetition, I think this is handled in a fun and visually enjoyable way. If you're learning a language I would also recommend additional learning tools/books etc, but this is fantastic to keep up with daily practice. So far I'm really enjoying it and it's VERY user friendly. üñ§"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is an amazing app for learning any language at your own pace. currently, I'm learning Portuguese and I can see progress in practicing 15 to 30 minutes per day."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Thank you so much for the amazing application. It's been really great using it. I however have been having an issue with it for some days now. Whenever I want to learn, it says I'm offline when I'm not. I'm even unable to access the lessons and can't even switch languages. I'm pretty sure I'm even on last position for this week's leaderboard because of that. Kindly help look into it. Once again, thanks for the application, it's been great!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Nice and friendly app. But for the past few weeks most of my XP are removed. Especially in the match madness. I worked hard for 60XP just now and by the end it says i only have 20 XP and have to start from level 1 even tho i completed it with more than enough time left. Please look into it . It make me frustrated
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Pretty good overall. Biggest issues are with subscription (is it really that difficult to program the move to super or to family or to an annual plan?), and the need for better explanations of conjugation. It would be great to get a ""mini dictionary"" of words learned so far,in both directions, for intense review"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,it is honestly a great language learning app but the only problem is it used to be easy to just forget about but with the new(ish) update where people can follow you and a new streak widget it keeps me more on track. but the notifications do get a little bit annoying at times but they are manageable so I think four stars is the right choice
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like the app so far, but why do you have to pay the subscription price as a yearly fee? why can't it be broken down to a monthly charge, especially since it's portrayed that way on the premium set up screen. So even though I have the funds for a month ($9.99) I can't do the free trial because I don't have $119.99 available to be charged. I probably would have bought a couple months while I prepare for a trip but you can take your $120 and shove it. I'd rather pay for Babbel."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new app icon is terrible (melting face). Makes me want to uninstall. I've tried to change it multiple times but it keeps resetting. I'm leaving this feedback via a 1 star review because I see no feedback option within the app. I intend to delete this review when the issue is resolved. Overall I mostly really like Duolingo, despite the long history of poor UX decisions that seem to be grasping for engagement at the expense of quality learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I formerly used the paid version of Duolingo, but, since becoming s pensioner, with a considerably-diminished disposable income, I have reverted to the free version. This has sapped all my pleasure in using the app - between lessons I have to endure endless advertising - especially for the paid version of Duolingo! Moreover, I even have to opt for additional adverts, so as to generate hearts, without which I cannot do lessions! This really has destroyed any pleasure I derived from using Duoling."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, it's great to have an app that connects cultures by helping people learn languages. Despite giving this 5 stars, I just want to mention that unless you pay for Duolingo Super, you see ads after every lesson and these ads are pretty insufferable - unskippable 60-second clickbait game ads with autoplaying sound. Since every lesson is about 3 minutes long, this means 25% of the time you're using the app is spent watching ads. Still, the app is free, so I guess that's the price you pay."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Up to 1060 day streak on the paid version which I'm enjoying enough to do a little each day. My only frustration with this app is that every year or so they fully change the layout and how the progressions work. Just when you think you've got everything maxed out/Gold to a certain point, it all changes and if you want the same Gold look again you've gotta redo heaps of things that you had previously put to bed."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Honestly.. there's nothing to add. this is the easiest way to learn a language for me. and what's is that you get to learn a new language anywhere. you don't have to be in France to learn french. it's so awesome...

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good way to learn a language. Score board is a bit of a joke as some people just do exercises to ramp up the number of points rather than learn (ie pick high scoring, easier exercises to climb the leaderboard). I've been doing this for over 100 days and not sure I feel at all confident speaking the language but hope to with more time."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app is good but since I updated the app Abt 3wks ago I have been having problems doing lessons. I would a good internet connection but the app would tell me that I'm offline when my internet connection is working perfectly. And that has affected my steak and my leagues. It has been dropping non-stop. Pls I would really like it if the problem could be resolved as soon as possible. Thanks
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A convenient and fun way to learn a new language. The lessons are short, so you can learn a tiny bit during breaks, or you can commit hours at a time. After a short evaluation, the lessons are adjusted to match your level of comprehension, which means your time isn't wasted going over material you already understand. 100% recommend."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love it, but tomake any lesson legendary they ask for 100 diamonds, which is a lot It is good that they have started teaching Telugu, but in the Telugu language learning they show every word in telugu,which never happens in any other language I would love if these problems are fixed"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a very easy yet effective language learning tool. I really appreciate each tasks and every detail of effort added to enhance the language learning journey. The daily reminders, the back review of your language learning progress which is put in to weeekly, monthly and even yearly progresses and daily motivation makes it an amazing tool. Thanks for such tool"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New update keeps me from using Duolingo.. When I open the App, it forces me to do a Minireview, since I didn't open the app for some days. This review starts at lesson 1 - a boring waste of time, I don't wanna do it so I close the App again. Also, I have to complete all levels of a lesson before moving to the next - I prefered mixing the lessons, helped me more. It uses dialects from different countries in Spanish without indicating, so I mix Spanish from America and EU.. despite, a helpful app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"inaccurate translations. I feel like this app is where you ""learn"" a language and class is where you go to unlearn all the bad habits and inaccurate translations this teaches you. Ex. douzo yoroshiku means roughly please take care of me/I'm counting on you and is generally used when first meeting people as a greeting. Duo has it as nice to meet you which is not strictly accurate. with more formal languages accuracy and context is more important than being ""generally"" correct."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It recently only gives exercises that only let you click blocks to make a sentence... Really awkward and slow to do. I wish there was an option to choose typing or blocks, not just give me one option. I find I keep making mistakes by clicking wrong block, it's frustrating. I may delete Duo after 700 day streak if it does not improve."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been learning German for about a month and the app is pretty great overall. but there're some things I don't understand for personalized practice lessons I constantly get asked questions about words and sentences I already learned sever units ago, I feel like it'd be much better to practice on units and lessons I more recently learned Furthermore, the stories you read and listen to ask about words and phrases I have no idea about, and haven't even learned yet."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I personally recommend using Duolingo if you want to learn a new language fast and easily. There are not that many ads and you can friend people you know. Overall I rate Duolingo a 10/10
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love the Spanish lessons/course. One thing Duo could do to better it's teaching/learning techniques is to assign and grade actual homework assignments. I know it gives the tip/advice but I do think people would be more inclined to do this if it helped increase their xp points or gems or both. You could also stall their advancement based on assignments completed/incomplete. Keep up the amazing and best free language courses anywhere. Can we expect a homework badge to be on its way?
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"""gamification"" is supposed to encourage learning somehiw, but in this case. it is nothing but an attempt to extort money for some kind of tokens. the graphics are HORRIBLE. utterly unfathomable. whoever is responsible for the design of the sites/apps should be forbidden to ever work in design again. BUT THE WORST THING IS THE AUDIO. though design is √† close second, the audio is more irritating than anything. it is incomprensible. the content and structure is great, but the presentation torture."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm currently on a 50 day streak learning French, and it gives you the right materials to learn at the right pace. the biggest issue people will face is being dedicated to spending at least 15 minutes a day learning to notice results as you learn."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love duolingo. I really do there's just one (actually 2) problems. My duolingo does not have any animations,unlike my friends account. The more serious but less heartbreaking problem is that the leader board does not show up for the classroom I'm in and it isn't just me this problem has happened to. I would sincerely appreciate it if they would fix this problem. As I then would rate this app 5 stars!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I gave Duolingo 4 stars because you got to make time for it but it is super fun I'm an 11 year old and I try to escape to do Duolingo and I even do it on the bus and on rode trips I honestly do it everywhere and I'm getting good at it but I already have kinda known Spanish but my Spanish teacher left out school when I was in 3rd grade so I have forgotten a lot.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There is a lot of room for improvement, such as, not forcing people to compete in their learning with others and threatening demotion. Allowing leatners to set their own goals would be a better option. Also, having an option to opt out of an exercise rather than forcing a learner to get something perfectly correct as many times as it takes for a correction of a mistake rather than just quitting the lesson."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is amazing, say you've stopped for a moment and have forgotten a bit, it has little reminder studies! I have taking German in school for six years and want to continue it out of school! I love the different ways it helps, this unlcudes learning to spell, pronounce and understand about how sentences are set up!! Love duolingo!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Honestly the app is great however I am having issues with the most recent version. For the Japanese language course, if you are going to make people do hiragana or katakana without pronunciation help even when they click the option that says ""no they don't want to do it without the pronunciation help"" then you need to integrate katana and hiragana into the main lessons to help with retention or you need to open up the ability to review katakana and hiragana."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"good app but needs more improvement. for instance, you listen to two hidden words. I often cannot differentiate between the two. having selected one it should reveal the two words that were being spoken. however, all round it is a good experience."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"the app is very good overall but the one thing I don't like is that when the ramp up challenges or lightning fast challenges come on the leaderboard section they take 30 gems which in my opinion is too much, maybe 15 or 10 gems would be great the app overall is very good, the only thing I don't like is using way too many gems"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I'm learning more than I thought I would. Good resource for beginners. I signed up for Super Duolingo but realized they were going to charge me for the full year instead of $6.99 a month. I was very disappointed. Now I have to wait and wait and wait for my hearts to recharge before I can continue. The way the ad reads is for $6.99 monthly. That I could afford.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Update wiped a full unit progress from my account. Not a great feeling. Earlier this year a huge update shook everything up and they just guess where you fit into their new layout. Had to deal with a bunch of new words and phrases all of a sudden. Trying to toggle pinyin on and off mid lesson frequently caused the lesson to crash so you'd have to start over. They removed the community discussions that were available on activities and you get no XP for reviewing old lessons.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The app is quite good and good for building a base to help learn a language faster. (with reference to the Japanese course) The latest update is great and I really love it. The best part of this update is that there is finally a separate section for kanji practice and I do not necessarily have to download another app for it. There are few ads but they never hinder with lessons. The app sometimes gives access to premium without any payment for few days which I find a great feature. Great app.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,there are the same lesson every time. you have to ameliored this for example begin with verbs after word and the sentences for help us to make sentence without mistake. despite i like it because i learn new word everyday as soon as its the same thing
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app to pair with other language learning resources or for beginners. Gets regular updates but can be lacking in features for some languages. Worth getting premium when it's discounted, particularly for those like me who want to speed through lessons and review later. Currently having issues with the app not loading after completing a perfect lesson, making me restart to get back to the home screen."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So cute and fun! Using the addictive power of apps for good. Learn to listen, speak and write in your target language. The way it limits the amount of mistakes you're allowed to make per session isn't great. You can upgrade to the paid version if it bothers you.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Wonderful app, I started learning Russian just yesterday night and today I already know how to introduce myself and other people in Russian. A perfect app for every person around the world especially for free. It is made like a fun game where you get rewards for every achievement, and because of that even kids find it easy to learn languages. You can edit your own profile without any adds, in fact the entire journey of learning the language in Duolingo is an add-free zone. I would recommend it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I am a paid subscriber of this app. Recently, double xps given me in a friends quest stopped working. I reported it earlier and confirmed with a friend, who also uses the app, that they aren't working for her either. I have yet to receive a response from Duolingo and it's not fixed. Also, you can't save xp boosts for later, most of the time. This is a feature that needs to be added. They also need to make it possible to put your streak on hold for situations like vacations or illnesses."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's definitely possible to learn a language with duolingo, but there are too few explanations about how the grammar works. Also, I am aware that the notifications can be disabled, but I'm still not really happy when I get woken up at 3 or 4 o'clock in the night because my hearts are refilled again and it's ""time to learn my language"". Not when I'm sleeping on a Monday."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Have been using it for a while. The app is basically free, but I have some complaints. I wanted to learn a new language without pressure and just as a hobby, but it has leagues, and it really pressurizes me as people with premium gets more privileges than those who don't and always are on top. Sometimes, they get the promotion level for us. It would've been better if it had an option for taking part in leagues or not as not everyone can make time to check every day and learn."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"duolingo, honestly one of the best language apps I've tried so far, I do like how the lessons are fast pace and keep you engaged with what your learning, one singular problem with it though is that it is not very forgiving at times, if you directly translate something into English through what the app tells, in terms of word placement, it might get you wrong, you would have to instead retranslate it into English (or any other language) and then you would get it right, but overall great appüëç"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I shouldn't feel forced to keep a streak or participate in a league/leaderboard. Some want casual learning w/out the feeling of needing to conform to streaks/leagues. A toggle on/off so if we want to feel pressured by a streak or the need to (one up others) then we can. Until you either do without streaks/leagues or have a way to turn it off & not be penalized for not maintaining your streak it's 3 stars. Turning off notifications doesn't count, I did that & I still feel pressured & penalized."

So anyone who is reading this Wondering if they should try this app, DEFINITELY üòÅ"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Im learning Japanese and so far I have no complaints. Its really addicting and I love the angry faces of the home screen widgets when you are nearing the end of the day to remind you of your streak and as a result im on a 37 days streak and still going. Its really good you can also buy premium to enhance your skilld further but there isnt a single part of the app that wouldnt stop you from learning if you dont pay. I really recommend this for learners. Please dont come to my house Duo! üôè
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A great supplement for language learning! However, it shouldn't be your only method of learning a language if you're really serious. The new path system is not ideal for users who were used to the tree system. It used to be organized and structured. You knew what to expect from lessons. Now it's just a circle in a never ending path with no real ""themes"" for the lesson. Also, there's a lot of clicking through when looking for things like daily goals or using XP boosts."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Duolingo is an exceptional language learning app. It offers a user-friendly interface, a wide range of languages to choose from, and engaging lessons that make learning fun and effective. The gamified approach keeps me motivated, and the progress tracking is fantastic. I've seen significant improvement in my language skills since I started using Duolingo. Highly recommended!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"There are bugs in time limit check during timed streaks. It ends while about 20+ seconds remain, faced it multiple times. I can record it and provide. Which make me using the app or to subscribe. I am trying Japanese with this app. Some more improvements can be done, but given 4 stars due to good features and look of the application and content. Thanks"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I appreciate the concept of turning language learning into a game, making it more engaging. However, even without the XP league and ladder, and especially streaks, the app shines bright with the orgiansed sections and language units as well as the multiple voices to help your ear adjust to heading the language. If only I could get my trophy badge back as it does not appear anywhere as an option. :-)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have a 200+ day streak. The idea behind this app is good but I feel like there is a lot of wasted potential. I love languages, but over time this app just gets boring. I wish the courses moved faster, it's not that fun when the same exercise appears 10 times in one session. There's also an annoying heart system."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I don't like being pushed into small streak goals. I prefer the option to not choose one and not be shown in increments of five (or however many). Can there be a ""no thanks"" option included?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ever since started baking in AI ""features"", the quality of the content took a drastic plunge and can be borderline useless depending on the language you want to study. Don't waste your time."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent! It seems to be a very intuitive App. The interface is clear and simple to use, and the experience is so pleasant that it is easy to come back to and use every day, without it feeling like a chore."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The small words it gives you initially seem pointless, but if you stay consistent in going back to it each day, it quickly gets really good,and you start saying sentences,which i really enjoyed. From my experience of using duo lingo, you do have to stick with it. Wen Duo Lingo tests you on pronouncing new words. i wish Duo Lingo would show you what it means in English as I then have to enter it into Google Translate to find out. Please add Maltese to your selection of languages please."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,duolingo us really nice and easy to learn and do. But i hate that we run out of hearts but atleast we can erase our mistakes and earn more so i guess it isnt all that bad. You should download it because it helps us learn more. I know some people dont like doing something everyday but please try it. Its super fun!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"After having duolingo for a long time, I think it has to be one of the best language learning apps in the app store. It's really good at motivating you to keep up with your learning, teaches you important verbs, nouns, adjectives, and adds fun aspects to learning a new language. I didn't give duolingo five stars because sometimes the lessons teach you random things that don't really build up to the other lessons. I think that some languages are better to learn with Duolingo as well. I recommend"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"DO NOT TRY A FREE TRIAL! This app is deceptive and a thief. I was told I would be notified before my trial was over, then I would be charged and it was going to be a monthly charge, instead not only did I not receive an email or even a app notification my trial was ending, I was surprised to have been charged with a $90 yearly subscription i did NOT authorize or can afford. Absolutely unacceptable, fighting for a refund but this is predatory with their use of ads to funnel you to a subscription."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is useful but I am literally just getting flooded with ads all the time. It's so frequent to the point where it's so annoying it just makes me want to get off the app sooner than I would if it had a normal amount of ads. I can get that they are trying to make money, (kind of the only thing they care about with this app, it's income) but that doesn't mean they should be showing you an ad everytime you finish a lesson. (So basically every 1.5-3 minutes.)"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, great app to try to remember some basic words/phrases. However, I do not appreciate one difference, as an Andrion-phone user. My girlfriend has an iPhone and she has some extra courses (for example, she has music-course whereas I have nothing. moreover, she has an extra-vocabulary notes and I have none of this) I don't like this kind of thing, so I'd like to make it equal for everybody"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Feel like this app is a very good way to learn a language. But I don't like the fact that you have to play the game every single day. I have stuff that I have to do and sometimes that stuff requires me to not have my phone and a lot of times it ends up being a day that I don't have my phone in which then I have to either pay 400 gems or I have to use one of my freeze streaks. I think it would be better if this streak was how many days you actually played on the app. Otherwise this is a good app.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Easy to use. Teaches practical language right away. You need the full version to practice though (I have only used the free version so far).
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was already fluent in French before trying duolingo for Spanish. I have been doing a little Spanish daily for about a year. I have used some other programs for variety, but right now it's only Duolingo. I consider myself advanced begginer, but recently started the spanish podcast and found it surprising how far I've progressed. Not perfect comprehension, but enough with slow spanish. I have gotten this far with the free version and am considering getting super duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"l love that the exercises are so interactive from listening, to speaking. Also repeation is important for learning languages. A great app !"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,EXCELLENT- I Like this I can change the selection to the words at a slower pace and see the words in Spanish again and again! Thankyou Duolingo.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is amazing! highly recommend it, even if you don't buy the super version. I understand French after only 94 days, imagine at 365,! I will practically be speaking it by then!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great way to learn a language for free, but the ads are really annoying. One does have the choice to pay & remove them, however. There are occasional mistakes, sometimes in corrections & sometimes DL forgets one has already completed a lesson, or doesn't give the number of points promised. Overall, a good deal though."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really like the free version of this app. I'm very impressed with what you get. However, I'd like to see more repetitiveness with the simple words so that I can get it committed to memory!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app! I'm curious. Is there a way to keep the goals from automatically becoming more difficult? I'm dealing with a health situation that keeps me from getting enough blood flow to my brain. When the difficulty increases, it can leave me exhausted the rest of the day. I'm planning to let go of meeting goals when the new year comes because of this. It's difficult enough with the holidays..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Can be fun as well as educational. I marked it down a little for two reasons; 1- it's obsession for forcing daily lessons. You should be encouraged by showing the total number of days you have logged on, not penalised for missing a couple of days (when ill for example). 2- Noticed that at almost 300 days in, there has been no practice with numbers, which is one of the first things you need when travelling."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is such a fun way to learn a new language or to improve a current one! It's easy and super efficient, I believe anyone could learn from Duo because the app is engaging to any audience out there that would like to learn! It's an incredible way to learn a language and some things I like is how you can say a word or phare/sentence and Duo will tell you if you're saying the word correctly!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"the courses are reasonable and really do help you retain the words you learn. the app also introduced conjugations in a way I can understand. and may I add the leader board? that is the single smartest thing ever. I may not always have the motivation to learn German, but when I remember possible demoting in rank, I do my lesson right away. the app gets you to learn, and helps you to build good habits one way or another. I LOVE Duolingo!! <3"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great app that's easy to use. i like the challenges and promotional zones that keep you focused to keep learning.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Duo does not teach. it just quizzes you with very little explanation of right/ wrong. You have to use outside sources to figure out what you are missing. but it is worth what I pay for it (nothing).
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Has wayy too many ads, the streak things give me too much pressure and the leaderboards and leagues always gives me a notification when I fall a bit behind and pressures me to do more and more lessons to get promoted onto the next league and not get demoted into the past league. The app is good tho, it's good for learning I was just a bit mad when I wrote this but here's an update- it's hard to figure out how to do something in the settings like what"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is one of those apps that, at first glance, looks like it won't help at all. ads, hearts that you lose when making mistakes, and an optional paid premium to get rid of it. But so far, I've been loving the app, and it's truly helping me learn a new language, 10/10 would recommend it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am trying to learn Latin, and the repetition of the exercises really helps me with retention, which in turn helps to build my confidence. Gamification of the learning process makes it fun, and I find myself practicing more often than I would with just a book or video lesson (not that I won't supplement my learning with those tools as well). Language is difficult for me, so this app hits the target as far as I'm concerned!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Using AI for unhelpful sentences and putting translators out of their jobs? Shutting down minority language courses because they aren't arbitrarily important enough? Using manipulative tactics to try and get interaction and engagement? Just a few reasons I'm not pleased with the owl. Do better.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The quantity of ads has increased so you're spending almost as much time learning as you are watching ads it feels. As it's a learn how words sound app you have the volume up, then you get a blaring loud ad play and turns you off from learning all together. It's a shame, it's really quite a good app minus the part about making you not want to use it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,recently the audio functionality for listening has not been working properly. unable to proceed without switching apps and going back
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! honestly my favorite app to help me with different languages! but, a tiny problem is there is a short add a few minutes each time, but for sure do recommend!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"–ü—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç! It's got quiet a few languages to choose from and all the options are FREE! Duolingo won't get you to fluency but it's a start. It has vocabulary, phrases, audible phrases for you to translate, speaking practice (these are a bit dodgy), that are all included in the base app. If you are looking at starting to learn a new language Duolingo is a place to start. –ü–æ–∫–∞! Update: The heart system is not okay, removal of practice button for free users was dirty. Update was made to push premium."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Dear Duolingo you keep playing an add for Temu that freezes the screen in the add with no way to ""x"" out of it. Luckily progress has been saved but the last 4 times I've completed a lesson this add plays and I have to manually exit the app and re-enter. This is annoying and I'm not sure if itts an issue with Temu or Duo or Android or my phone specifically but it is souring my Duolingo experience currently."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"All in all this is a great app and it's free so you can't complain a whole lot, however it's quite irritating that it regularly uses a steak freeze even though I practiced. I don't know why it does this but it happens and it bugs me. Really one of the reasons I won't upgrade, I don't buy glitchy apps. But still 5 stars forthe free version. Update: The so just ate 100 of my points that I earned. It's supposed to give me something for that, and it didn't, it simply deleted 100 points."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been using the app for over 2 years now and usually love it. It keeps on crashing all the time, sometimes I can't even open the app, sometimes it crashes after I've done a lesson and then it doesn't recognise that I have done one and uses a streak freeze. Been happening for weeks. Very annoyed!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's good but there are a few downsides. first of all, you can only use the app properly with a subscription. You can only use the basic feature but you need to pay for extra lives and more fun learning types. The streak and level idea is great to get to your goal more quickly, however another huge downside is, that you can't really progress after some time because you can conclude most answering without learning. Also most languages are only compatible with english. Overall okay"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Duolingo recently laid off a bunch of people. That alone deserves a low rating. They've also removed helpful features that explain grammar. Why did you get that wrong? Guess. Duo Plus isn't worth it bc it makes you lazy. People who actually want to learn won't be happy w this app.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Better than expected. Find it great for the memorizing part of learning a new language, primarily for improving reading and listening (it also practices creating sentences, which might help with writing/speaking, but the practice is too simplified). Using it as a complementary tool for Japanese, that makes me practice daily due to it's good gamification. If your goal is to also learn kanji, I recommend turning off romaji/kana transcriptions, so that you're forced to practice reading kanji."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I have been taking the Japanese course and found it wanting in a few ways. Often times it will say the next questions will be harder. Only to have them be the exact same ones it was just asking. More infuriating though is when it shows no variety in the questions it asks. For most of a chapter/unit it asked me to translate minor variations of the same sentence. When the unit was about more than just that one thing.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love the app and will recommend to anyone who wants to learn a language happily. I'd only suggest that longer stories should be put in the practice section. Thank you so much
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I understand that super duolingo needs to have some cool features, but making lesson specific practice only exclusive to super duolingo makes it harder for regular users. When I come to a unit that's particularly hard for me, it takes me forever to pass it because I can't practice what I'm having an issue with. I basically finally pass it after I've memorized the lesson answers, which is usuless for learning the lesson I was supposed to be learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo utilizes a ""heart"" system that I do not believe facilitates learning. It is designed in a way to feel like you are harshly punished for making mistakes, even though those moments are most critical for learning. Duolingo may be a good way to learn basic vocabulary and phrases, but it is not effective at teaching advanced grammar or helping one understand normal conversation in a new language. And the only good version of the app is a paid subscription to circumvent the above grievances"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,i absolutely love this app .... i love learning languages and this app rocks when it comes to learn language with fun ..... i have improved so much in the languages I learn and the info that it provides about each chapter is awesome..... a great app to learn something new ... on top of that it provides so much for free is for real awesome
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is very interesting app to learn any language very easily as You can also check your performance. I highly recommend you this app before learning any language. üëçüëçbut sometimes it shows offline...ü§î
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Enjoyable language learning! Would be better if they had lessons regarding things like gender of nouns, the basics on accents and how they change the sounds of words, etc. It's fun though and a much better use of time than scrolling on social media. I do wish they would give you ten free hearts each day (you lose one heart each time you make a mistake) - or lower the cost of the super subscription. Try it! You can learn a new language for free! J'aime Duo!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Really good app, actually learned good stuff from it but the only disturbing thing about it is the heart recharging thing. It takes 4 hours for just a single heart! For a person that practices everyday, it's quite too much. I know there are other ways to earn hearts but I don't always have time or patience for that so it would be even better if duo had a more fair hear recharge time."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Ive been using this app basically since it was started, and its gone downhill sooooo bad. I dont mind paying, but its gotten more expensive for less. They used to let you use gems to buy different thing ( duo costumes, different little lessons like a romantic sayings lesson, you used to be able to buy boosts) and now you cant do any of that. Its lost its charm, and i swear sometimes i get 2 of the same lessons in a row. I miss the old one"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I'm actually not happy with Duo because they caused me a 50 day streak ;I could not connect even when I had a good internet connection. But I won't deny them any Star. I acknowledge them as the best language learning Appüåπ
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,it's not a perfect replacement for a language course but it's a very helpful tool to complement your learning and for free you really cannot complain.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been a paying subscriber for a couple of years now. Starting yesterday it started complaining that I wasn't online; when I left and came back it might load my progress but if so it would say I hadn't practiced at all. Today it's even worse and is stuck not loading the next lesson. I'm obviously online, I'm writing this review. And web browsing and everything else works, just Duolingo is broken. Everything works but this. Uninstalling."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The free version helps a lot of people I am sure but they really hold back features that are really necessary and to get them you have to pay.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I used to love Duolingo but since the biggest update it seems to have taken a downward turn. I used to like repairing the broken lessons, it meant you could brush up on things you had done a while ago but since the update there seems to be no good way to review older lessons, the new practice/today's review repeats itself so much, it only reviews the last two lessons I had done so anything before that I haven't seen for dust and there is no good way to refresh the previous courses :("
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app so much. it's been helping me learn Spanish and it helps keep you on track by keeping a personal streak. Very motivating and fun.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is generally good to help me remember the Spanish I learned. My biggest complaint is it appears that the coders translated everything a word for word. For example, to ask a question, the coders put it exactly like you do in America. Pronoun goes before the verb. In Spanish, the verb always goes before the pronoun if you're asking a question. This is incredibly frustrating because if you do that in a country that speaks Spanish, people will look at you weird."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Avoid at all costs, i have lost place in the leagues because it jeeps losing my daily updates. Was a good app, but recent updates have been bad. Now when I do lessons between 6am and noon or 6pm and midnight, it forgets and I lose my steak or double points reward. Fells more like they want to make money fro. The app , by selling you points, and not helping you learn the language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Awesome! Currently I'm learning German and Scottish Gaelic, and although Scottish Gaelic is a little deceiving sometimes with the way they sound and how they're spelt out, Duolingo can easily help me learn and understand the words! Thank you!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Easy access to knowledge!! I've been on Duolingo for YEARS now and it's never let me down. Even though there's a paid version now, it does not affect the general courses, it doesn't stain the premise of FREE learning, you can pay if you WANT to, but it's not required, so that's amazing. I've improved my English through the app when I took classes and now it's how I'm teaching myself Korean since I can't afford classes for a while. GREAT app, GREAT content and it's always getting BETTER. ily Duo"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used to really like this app and completed the whole Spanish course but the new updates make it almost unbearable to use. Ads every couple of minutes, running out of hearts means you can't carry on after a few mistakes, all the unnecessary gamification like rewards and leaderboards that no-one cares about. It's totally ruined it"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a little rough and it teaches you sort of how you would speak to a child, but builds up alright. Be patient with yourself and trust your instincts. I'm lucky enough that my family wanted to learn so we got the plan but I remember learning the free version was sort of difficult because I couldn't practice my mistakes as often. That killed most of my desire to even keep trying. If you can jump that hurdle you should be alright. Not enough space for full review."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"very easy to navigate and use, with minimal adverts. I am learning Spanish, which I have never learned before but have gone from zero to having a good grasp of the language. I would definitely recommend it."

Now it's extremely buggy, doesn't work without high-speed internet, has a huge download size and constantly nags you to use it (notifications worded to pander to 7 year olds and peppered with emojis). More and more functions are shoved behind a paywall even though it already has a lot of ads. You have to click through about 6 non-skippable screens after each exercise. This app is not good for your mental health"

I can not emphasize enough how much of a MUST HAVE APP this is! Pros: you can 100% learn from Duolingo without paying a cent, the courses are fun and effective, you can learn whether you have 3, or 30, minutes /day, learning a language has helped me to be more involved in deeper conversations, on various topics, already. Again, you need to get this app!"

And the support never reacts or answeres. Even when I reported a critical bug of music that just starts playing out of nowhere - no reaction, no bug fix. And I was thinking of buying a paid version because the concept of the app is great. But the support is very poor with zero attention to mistakes they have."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's free & the ads are ok. The order they introduce vocab is generally unhelpful if your goal is to use the language on a tourist setting. They also have a bad habit of throwing big new stuff at you with little prep. Often I'd like to self direct things & they don't allow for that‚Äîe.g., having trouble with similar words or Japanese characters that their testing avoids pairing b/c failure slows you down (the limited hearts). They don't teach pronunciation explicitly. But it kinda works? I hope?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It's good but I want the profile photo as my gallery photo like the old version of Duolingo I hope they bring that feature back... Than it should obviously be a 5 star and also the updated version of Duolingo is not so good...
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it's a good app and all things considered I've learned a lot. it's not perfect, but it's very enjoyable and if you give it the power, it's consistent learning tools help keep it in your mind"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They changed things around and now you're stuck to a set path. Frequently asks for answers that were never taught. Counts things wrong that are correct. Makes you do speech exercises that it then doesn't hear correctly and counts those wrong. I would not pay for this app. Use the free version and first, then find a better app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"broke my streak of 80 days and uninstalled despite having a year subscription, after learning about layoffs in relation possibly using AI. I'm not against use of AI as tools to support/supplement a human workforce but I'm not going to pay to help put people out of jobs. Also the learning experience in the app has been decreasing in quality. Most lessons are fun but half of the exercises barely explain"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I really recommend this app because it explains it well and starts off easy the better you get the harder you get to where it shows you how to pronounce the word too.I found out Duolingo from a family member my family is Mexican so it's hard to communicate with some of my family members but when I found a out this app it's life changing I'm able to communicate now and have a conversation with my family in Spanish.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have the family plan so it is a whole lot easier to rate but, if I didn't have the family plan, I would rate a little lower. But Duolingo is a perfect app for beginners because it's actually fun. Unlike some other language apps. Lastly, it's actually effective. It's not TOO fun but not TOO boring. Overall, great app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"was skeptical at first, having already learned a 2nd language through school and overseas travel. however I love the Duo methods and interactivity in a game-like manner. I'm learning a 3rd language since nearly a year and feel like I've progressed much faster -and cheaper - than I would sply with lessons every week. Repetition, context and regularity of practice are key to progressing, while I only spend 15-30 minutes a day, max."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Can't recommend anymore after the changes. They say they keep progress but I got pushed very far back with stuff I learnt a long time ago. So I now have to do 20(?) questions max 2 wrongs to skip units. Units that mostly contain stuff I knew a long time ago, but also some things I have not been introduced to. I can't reasonably redo a bunch of units to learn specific words they hadn't taught me in the old style though. Like lipstick or whatever"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"There are many great aspects to this language learning platform, however the way it is competition based detracts from the learning. One who is competitive may choose to use the loopholes to score points on information they already know to rank higher on the leaderboards, rather than actually learning the next lessons. This app would be much better if it was based on competition with yourself than the whole world. You decide. This crippled my learning and eventually I left the app all together."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The pressure to pay is enormous in this app. The timed challenges are impossible to finish without paying and the adverts for the paid subscription are never ending. The improvements to the app are still outweighed by this. I only have experience with Spanish, but the learning is only developed for travel or study. If you only want it to holiday, and you can overcome the boredom, then the app could be a good way to learn some basic to moderate Spanish, but don't get your hopes up."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is really good for learning a language, or at least it's been serving me well so far. I understand that ads may be required, but the rates at which the ads show up is quite ridiculous. I tend to finish a lot of lessons in under 3 minutes. And having one ad after each lesson is too much."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've used duolingo on and off for years, but it's gotten really bad. Recently they started firing their human employees and just use computerized translation. You can tell. Don't use this app. Study the language in a serious way instead. You'll learn to communicate with real people, you'll get better results, and it's much more rewarding. I promise."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"An excellent tool for learning a new language. While there have been some changes to their format that have caused slight disruptions to my learning, I also ultimately felt that the changes were improvements, and evidence that they care about their product. Using the app free doesn't limit you too much, but the subscription appears to offer enough and be economical enough that I expect I'll still pull the trigger on that, eventually."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Duolingo often has the little owl pop out and say they teach endangered languages like Navajo. The Navajo part of the lessons is FAR less comprehensive and thorough. There's no voice to hear or repeat beyond the first lessons. Additionally the AI bias towards the basic sentences are extremely skewered towards a view of the Anglo-Saxon idea of what a conversation in Navajo is compared to the basic sentences taught in other languages. I guess that to learn other languages is ok but not Navajo
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is an excellent language learning app, earning it a solid five stars. The gamified approach makes learning fun, and the diverse range of languages is impressive. The bite-sized lessons are perfect for busy schedules. However, occasional ads can be a minor inconvenience for free users. Overall, a highly effective and enjoyable language-learning experience."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've completed all levels in Greek and my learning has completely stagnated. Daily lessons on legendary are a chore, it's the same phrases over and over, lesson after lesson, day after day. No variety - it's just plain boring! Please Duolingo, if you actually read this, I want some new Greek content, something challenging. I appreciate it that it's not a hugely popular language, but you have over 1.5m Greek learners, in the top half of courses! Superduo subscriber but my renewal is cancelled."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo doesn't lie when they say they have the best education in the world. They really truly do! I'm taking 3 languages at once time on Duolingo and going at the pace I need to. And that's another good thing, you can go completely at your own pace. I say you give it a shot. Duolingo is completely free with absolutely no fees or payments!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's very helpful to learn language in duolingo but it's so annoying when we do the same language over again. Like let's use Spanish. Pan =bread. I have to learn how to say this every day. Other than that it's wonderful
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Easy to follow. I'm learning quickly. I wish some of the badges had higher goals as I reached the max levels quickly, but that doesn't get in the way of learning the language itself. I like that you could work on several languages at a time if you wanted. I've been using this app daily for 65 days now. It's had no notice bugs or problems on my end. There's room for improvement with the challenges and achievements but will continue to use this app regardless."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great app - I love the animations. The best thing is the Widget that turns red and angry when you are in danger of breaking the streak - much more motivating then pop ups
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The personalized practise levels are quite pointless, the words Duolingo suggest I have difficulties with are the easiest ones. And nothing like the mistakes under ""my collections"". If I go back a few units to practice words I know I have difficulties with suddenly Duolingo only gives me easy challenges and stuff I know. Don't pay for Duolingo if personalized practise is a feature you were hoping to be useful."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I previously wrote that this was an excellent of program but I have changed my opinion. There are many inconsistencies, errors and just outright bugs that make this program at times frustrating. I've written and reported many of them and nothing gets done so I have dropped my five stars to three anything's continuous they are I will drop them to one star. I am a college educated speaker of English as my native language trying to study Spanish. Emphasis on trying."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a really good way of learning languages but I don't like that ads for super Duolingo keep popping up I just don't want it other wise it's a good app.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,on of the best of for learning languages. currently I don't have time to start a course so busy at my work. I started learning here along with my work. next year I will moved USA job purposes. its will help me a lot of my English learning
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,the way the lessons are presented make it super easy to remember and I can't believe it's such a quality service for free. I got the super Duolingo but the free teaches just as good
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,absolutely perfect app for the learners to make more understandable on new words and make you to can get 4skills easily. I strongly recommend it.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Fun at times. Disheartening when you have to sit through a whole ad to get credit for your streak. The amount of times I have finished a course, put away my phone for the ad, close the app, and then not get credit for the day because I didn't watch through the ad is really annoying. It pushed me away from using this app as it keeps building a negative association of doing work and still not getting the reward, after receiving multiple notifications throughout the day."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I recently started learning Japanese with Duolingo, and I couldn't be happier with the experience. The Super Duolingo subscription has taken my language journey to the next level. The additional features and benefits are well worth the investment. The app's gamified approach makes learning Japanese not only effective but also incredibly fun. From the well-structured lessons to the challenging exercises, Duolingo keeps me engaged and motivated."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"a fun way to wrap your head around languages. wish they'd start at greetings instead of random words, but getting into the rhythm, you quickly pick stuff up."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The computer version is way better, it gives you something to read to help with ""why is it like that?"" and I just couldn't easily find that on the app. It also lags a little so you make mistakes that aren't your fault, the app just lagged and didn't insert the word you put in. Overall, meh. I'd use the desktop version over the app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's so fun to play and I'm learning at the same time. If I just opened YouTube it wouldn't help 2 as fast as Duolingo is helping me. The only problem I see right now are 1 the hearts:you have to practice just to get one heart and 2 it could use a little more laugeus. But overall it's really good being able to customise yourself, play games a see the adorable characters."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! it really helps people who might be struggling with speaking or practicing spanish. I started using this last year and everyday in Spanish class we do 15 mins of Duolingo before working. it boosts my mind and gets me in the Spanish zone! it takes stuff slowly which makes me learn better! I would suggest getting this app if you are interested in any language, even if it's not Spanish. If you get correct answers this app recognizes that and celebrates it! Get this app!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,doulingo is the best app to learn different languages but now these days there are so many addes it interrupt a studies also but there is a premium think where we have to pay money and then there no one will interrupt you so this is a very bad choice to earn money I think this is a bad decision
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Unfortunately it does not offer grammar training, only vocabulary. This makes it hard to learn a language properly if you don't know the basic grammar and tenses already."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's so bad with the AI translation. Too many mistakes and sentences that don't make any sense. Also they remove the ability to communicate and learn from others.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Becoming unusable as as soon as I open the app it starts playing a silly tune which I think is from some advert that has opened at the same time and then carries on playing even when I come out of the app and have to force stop on the app for it to stop playing the tune on my phone
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Constant requests to make family plans or join up and pay. Long lame ads that advertise programs and things of no interest to me. A incredibly stupid heart system where you can only make 5 mistakes and wait ages for your hearts to recover. If I am watching ads, the hearts system should restore faster Next, I have poor vision due to an accident, but you have to do typing exercises and word matching, which I find slow and hard. So speed exercises are pointless and hard for me."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"For what reason would Duolingo update their App only for it to glitch all through. And painfully reduce the time for tasks to be completed. I gave you five starts before because, despite what anyone had to say, and the fact that I had flagged several words with no audio of which was not corrected, I was having still a wonderful experience regardless learning my Chinese course. But no, you went ahead to spoil it all with this unnecessary update. Correct it real quick, else I will keep coming back"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Pretty smooth app with a lot of different gamification and social features to motivate you. The quality of the content varies a lot between courses - eg popular courses like Spanish and Japanese are quite well designed, newer courses like Vietnamese are clunky. There are some annoying features like you can't drag and drop word elements in sentences, if you miss a word like ""now"" you have to input the whole sentence again. Overall Duolingo seems best for upkeep rather than learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it is a great app to learn the basics and for increasing vocabulary. you can practice your speech, but I don't think it is accurate at picking up mispronounciations. there is also a lack of explanation as to why you use certain tenses. overall, I am happy with it, as it is a fun aid to learning a language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love duolingo! I am learning more german, and I think it is useful that it does challenge you, and it is so much fun! It also has a little icon on the top,a little notebook, so if you ever forget how to order something, or forget what to say, that is also very useful! Duolingo has been helping me a lot, and I can't wait to learm much more! I give this app a 5 star! Versuch es! (Try it out!)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Challenge accepted. Can be a right pain and has been slow lately, but it gives us access and information on other countries and cultures. No matter how it performs, it's a guide to follow.. Edit. App no longer shows your awards target in Achievements. Regularly freezes and animated characters no longer work or sometimes even appear."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm learning Portuguese right now, and within two months of practice, I learned how to order food, describe people, and more. I'm branching out to learn Spanish now since Portuguese is so similar. This is most fun I've had using a language app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"great app, but getting XP is kind of hard. Plus, you have to wait hours to get more hearts, on the positive side it makes it easy to learn languages."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"NO SOUNDS IN MANDARIN COURSE! I HAVE CLEARED CACHE, RESET THE COURSE, UNINSTALLED THE APP, CLEANED THE PHONE, REINSTALLED THE APP. ITS MISSING! I cannot report these bugs through the web form, because you have errors!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is my favourite, I'm writing a research about it in my academic studies. Thanks to all the participants and teachers for their constsnt efforts for improving the app. I just wanna share my opinion about the legendary league, I didn't like the new update of the legendary league, it was better when it was all together in an 8 lessons portal and with three hearts for each lesson, apart from the 5 hearts for the other lessons. Now the three hearts are gone, and it's not in one portal!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I enjoy going back to the beginning in Polish and reviewing what I've learned so far. You get easy points and the repetition just reinforces my memory. At 64 years of age it is very challenging learning the crazy words and how to spell them. I hope I am creating new connections in my brain to help me remember in different ways.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love duolingo. Learning a language has never been so fun. challenges, leaderboards and friends make it an enjoyable way to reach your language goals, maintaining a streak makes sure that you practice at least once daily. And if you're competitive, being promoted into the next league for having gained a lot of XP feels like a great achievement. My whole family uses it, we all learn different languages, and it's a great new conversation starter."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Everything is good but please change language barrier..we want to learn that language within the same text as of the language as well it's vry annoying and difficult at the same time.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, but what is annoying is it will give you an answer wrong even though it never told you that was a possible answer. Or when I new word comes along it doesn't teach you first it will just assume you know and give you the answer wrong. I have almost missed my daily streak because of this."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Gonna have to take a star down because I'm heavily disappointed. I was wondering why I kept missing my lessons everyday when I had the widget right and front of me, and today I finally almost lost my streak. And what's the issue? The issue is none of the reminders, or the widget, works."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Some of the exercises are very repetitive and not very relatable. I would prefer a useful travelling section for holidays rather than endless drilling around students and universities and green t-shirts
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The newest update to the achievements made it unable to keep track of your progress towards the next level/stage in any of them. Also the art was changed. They look super flat now and the color palettes just seem weird. And from what I can tell, that's all they did. How is this an improvement? I don't understand why they made these changes that make the experience objectively worse."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Obviously it's one of the best and most well known language learning sites to ever exist, but there are still random bugs here and there. also the expressions of the characters are minimal. Were they removed in an update? They don't clap and cheer when you get a question right like I remember..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"the app really does its job correctly, it teaches you languages you want to know, the only complaint I do have is that you have lives, and you have to wait four hours to get one back, but other than that I think the app is great at what it's intents are"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"There's a bug right now I think, where the conversation tab ""speak"" is not working. The app is great but buggy sometimes. I'm learning Korean on here and mainly trying to understand the alphabet before I move on with deeper lessons, and I thought of a suggestion. Could you guys add an option in the mistakes tab that lets us pin any amount of them or unpin them so that we can go over some mistakes a lot more until we feel confident about it"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The strength of this program is that it is fun. I do not expect to become fluent, but if I keep it up, I will have a good foundation to build on. It builds knowledge slowly, and combines Chinese characters with their sounds and meanings. It also does a pretty good job of judging your pronunciation. You are constantly active. The cartoon characters they use engage you. But you have to do it every day, or your progress probably will be limited."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,it's a great app for learning new languages and I would suggest it to everyone learning a new language but however in some cases there are different types of the language you are speaking and this app doesn't teach you those different types.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've experienced this app for nearly two months and it's actually not bad. Struggling when tried to learn English (for Vietnamese learners) due to some Vietnamese grammatical issues, otherwise this app is pretty good for new learners who use English as the basis language to start learning others for living, traveling, working, etc... or maybe just for fun."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I have enjoyed learning with Duolingo; the only thing I would improve is to have more translations included when you get certain exercises correct... Sometimes I'll get the green screen without any translation of what I just got right. I feel like it would reinforce the learning if the translation sentence was included on every correct screen.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a great way for you to start a new journey by learning a new language, Duolingo even allows you to purchase super duolingo, But it allows you to try out super duolingo for 2 weeks! This app is seriously great!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You have to close the app completely when an overly loud ad pops up, if you wait and close the ad the app is completely blank and cannot be used. I miss the old educational duolingo, that one was actually helpful in learning, if I could afford to just go to Mexico and start learning I'd rather do that. This app has turned into a cash grab and data miner, pretty sure they've payed for good reviews cause anyone I've ever asked about using this app has long since deleted it because it's so trash."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This last update was not a good one. When I do a lesson, it does not advance so I have to completely get out of the app, clear it out of my phone, and then go back in. Everytime. Please fix."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"absolute fun and meanwhile, I am also learning a language. Really love the interface, the UI, the interactiveness and the how it's less intimidating and more fun."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I do appreciate and recommend this app, but in order to be a 5 star app I feel it needs some more features. For example, after I get an answer correct, it would be very helpful for the app to remind me which conjugation was used (i.e. passato remoto). I also wish it was better at learning what I have trouble with and prompting me to review that. Sections to drill hundreds of most common words would also be great. Thanks for all your work on the app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a fantastic language-learning app. It's great for beginners and offers a variety of languages. jeeps you engaged and motivated. It's effective for building vocabulary and basic grammar. However, it may lack depth in conversational skills and advanced proficiency. Some translations and sentences may be inaccurate or unnatural. Overall, I highly recommend Duolingo for language beginners."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I love the platform and all it provides. My only problem is that sometimes I can't even log into Duolingo as it will never load. Including data and WiFi connections.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Came back to Duolingo thinking there would be improvements but it's become more frustrating & still doesn't give practical phrases. Expects you to perfectly write & spell but lacks in conversation. Doesn't teach the why of language rules so easy to make mistakes w/ harder languages. It also constantly freezes up after completing exercises and doesn't give credit or rewards so you basically have to redo & forfeit lives lost. Shame as it has a great selection of languages. Not worth paying or free
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to be the best app out there with the ramp up and lightning rounds being great ways to review. Now Match Madness has replaced lighting rounds and is horrible for learning. No review of sentence structure, and rushes for answers with no comprehension. Help and feedback have not responded once!!! The target practice is so repetitive that nothing helps me review what is learned. Very disappointed in changes!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm sure paid version is better, but the ads in the free version are very annoying; and the push messages get old after a while. Between the two, it almost makes me want to use a different program. And I'm not even certain how much I'm learning. After 6 months I can only pick out little bits of what people are saying when I listen to them speak the language I'm studying."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It helped me so much it is very good but I got confused in the 2024 thing for super duolingo. It says for no ads. What is the problem is I never had ads on duolingo. Still it is the best way to learn languages. Thanks for suffering to read this!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very dissapointing! Started out as very learnful and fun. With goals and challenges for me, and the ability to practice. That is not so anymore. It is getting less and less fun and certainly not helping me practice. You are actually making me hate this app! Paying for an app, and it is not a small amount, I would think that there was someone I could get answers from. But this is not so with you. The next step is canceling my subscription."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"definitely a best way to learn new languages while playing. wish that teachers could teach us like this appüòå.... but anyways it is the best app ever I love it. definitely download this app if anyone wants to learn new languages,it's just perfect!!üôÉ"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Super Duolingo ""Free"" Trial.. when I signed up for the trial, I was told that I would be notified 2 days before the trial period ended. I thought it would be a push notification from the app (like most trials) But I woke up to a Google Play Receipt for my subscription to Super Duolingo, along with a CHARGE OF $89.03 !! I do NOT want Super Duolingo and I CANNOT afford a $90 charge. I got an spam email to my shared account with my sister and never got a notification to my phone or from the app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo's focus is almost solely on the teaching of reading skills. This is to the exclusion of what is required for conversing in a language. When incorrect answers are entered by the user, no explanations are provided by Duolingo to assist in learning. The app rarely provides grammar tips, and there is an absence of the teaching of basic language rules, conjugation charts, etc. Duolingo is essentially a partially interactive dictator."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Ive taken a few different languages on here, i even started learning latin and idk why but it's so fun!!! anyone could learn on this. once you keep on track with it, your skills will sky rocket! I was watching a show and I could even understand what they were saying üò≥ .. way cool. then there is my italian, and french after that!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Download this app a few years ago to learn Spanish but I uninstalled it due to decrease in motivation and the way the app taught the language in just the first couple of lessons. I reinstalled it 4 days ago to start learning German and I'm already seeing a significant change. I'm more motivated and really enjoying the teaching experience the app provides. I dont enjoy the consistent ads but I'd say this app is overall worth trying! And maybe one day Id love to see if Duolingo add ASL if possible
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love that they teach a word and then give it in context. Then there are several different questions (new language to English, English to new language with multiple choices, English to type it out, matching games etc) to help cement the new word, its spelling, and its meaning into memory. When they teach you a new group of words, they mix in the old ones to keep them fresh. In settings, there is an option to turn off the shrill bell that rings when you get an answer right. Great for kids too."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Eveything was good until a week ago. I praticed my 60th something day and then next day, it said i didn't and put a freeze on that day. One time, ok. Then yesterday it happened twice. I have to redo 1 lesson twice to achieve my 72th day streak (again, cuz I did once and my progress disappeared). And today it disappeared again, I am still at 71th day. I have to refill my freezer with gems for such an unreasonable bug?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Like the repetition of words and phrases. Enforces the learning. I hope it builds into a more complex learning

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"If you want to learn a language in a fun way , this is the right app for you. I downloaded this to learn Spanish and this has been very helpful for me. The way it makes us learn languages , especially the points table and achievements makes us extra competitive. You could also get a streak by doing a lesson every day.This makes us not to skip a lesson(wow!). The only drawback is that if you don't have 'super' Duolingo , then you will have to do majority of the stuff by giving away your gems."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Im am simply shocked how such a popular app can be so poorly designed. Sure they made the whole thing look like some cutesy video game so kids (and tiktok gen adults) will find it not too boring, but the structure is ridiculous. Teach you first then ask questions? No that is so 2005. We just have you press colorful buttons and guess. Keep guessing wrong until u get it right. They lost me when the translation of Gracias = thanks was wrong then 2 mins later the translation of thanks = gracias"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love the way Duolingo helps to learn a language and how useful the widget is as a reminder but it really frustrates me when they update the app and move topics around. So I'm told I'm learning a new word when I've already learnt it in the past because the subjects have moved. Also some of the sentences are utter nonsense.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,lots of ads and very basic sentences repeated. grammar points are not explained at all and you are just expected to realise the rules. best used alongside other learning.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"enjoying using this app so far, my only gripe is that the lives could come back just a little faster. There have been times where I would have tried to squeeze in another lesson but didn't because I was low on them and didn't want to lose progress, however I think the lives also help to make me concentrate more so as not to make mistakes and lose any."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Fantastic learning app. Would give a 5 star review if they programmed in a volume mixer or equalizer in order to avoid blowing out our ear drums when we finish a lesson by making the volume of the lesson equal to the volume of the ads or making the volume of the ads equal to or lower than the volume of the lesson. Please, please fix the issue with the volume. Either the ads are too loud (especially that spanish one with the guitar riff at the beginning) or the lessons are too quiet."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love this app. Now it's all about money. Everything is geared to you buying gems or hearts. I paid for a yearly subscription and worked my way to the highest league. I couldn't afford to reup the sub and now because I'm handicapped I just lost a year of work because you can't compete with people paying. The lessons aren't effective anymore either. They changed everything to each lesson being once where as before there was tons of repetition and practice, no longer."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Worst language app ever Started using this a year and a half ago and it just gets worse as time goes on. No explanations for anything. No grammar. Sometimes no translations. And if all that wasn't bad enough, they've completely closed the forums. So if you have a question, you're out of luck. You have to google the answer. Good luck learning a language that way. I learned more in ten weeks with a real teacher than I did in nine months with this app."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I am enjoying the app although sometimes I find myself trying to get points for the leaderboard instead of actually focusing on learning. I also wish the new features would roll out on Android at the same time as iOS. My friends are playing with new features that I'd like to try out like music and math.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It is good for learning but I feel like half my time is spent scrolling past screens. There are 10 second ads after every 30 second exercise. App constantly has extra screens to skip through (results of exercise, daily quests completed, claim reward, try lightning round, create a profile, try plus for free, get a heart by watching an ad, select a streak, etc.) Please just let me complete an exercise, watch an ad every third time, and then bring me to the next exercise."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I did not follow through with another Spanish language course, but Duolingo is FUN! I look forward to my daily lessons. The topics build on themselves in a logical manner. You actively participate in every lesson, whether it's speaking or translating from English to Spanish and vice versa. Every lesson provides an opportunity to hear how the sentences are pronounced, with options to listen to the words more slowly. Even the quizzes are fun!"

My points (and probably also the points of other contestants) are updated in the leaderboard with huge delay (I mean at least minutes, sometimes 20-30 minutes are not enogh for an update). Just today I noticed that once my points were correctly updated, a look at the leaderboard 2-3 completed excercises later, showed the points I had at the start of the day (less than the poins shown at the previous look).

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"this is an extremely helpful app. no problems what so ever with it. I have been watching anime with Japanese subtitles for awhile now, and if you have, too, this app will help you learn based from what you already picked up on. if it is too hard for you, maybe you need some prior experience, but for those who have prior experience with the language they want to learn, this is a breeze."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"it suppose to be free of advertising but they lie, it is not. Also they try to charge you more to learn by often requiring to buy hearts. they don't do refunds so if you buy it you are stuck with it. Also they are impossible to get into contact with and don't respond to emails. that charged my account twice and had to go to my bank to get the double charge back. I will not renew when my year is up because I don't think they are honest"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Extremely engaging and a great way to learn things by heart quickly. Personally I like to know the grammar rules too so that I don't have to learn everything by heart, but there are plenty of other resources for that. It would be very convenient to have a grammar summary for each section in the app itself though. Or a way to enter them yourself, like notes for a section."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Too gameified, doesn't promote learning as much as earning points. (Top of the leaderboards spam voice practice to get points, which can even be cheated so the app does them for you) Language recognition is worse in the app today than it was 10 years ago, and if you care, it promote ""woke"" stuff like articles about ""black Spanish"" and the ""Latinx"" meme. Fun game, I got to the top of Diamond League. There's surely better apps for learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy the learning modalities, but talking about sheep and rabbits in the office fixing computers over and over is unnecessary. give us more realistic sentences, more about the language's culture (German).

"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Play to win. Used to be a really good app back in the day now just a way to harvest money from their customers. The introduction of hearts and a completely linear path saw to that. And match games are physically impossible once you get so far also. Every update they change the length of the modules so any progress you make feels worthless like a game of snakes and ladders. I payed for super duolingo regretting it now. To top it off I'm stuck with this ugly melted logo for the app.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's free with adverts. It's okay. Some languages are much better supported than others. There are problems with most courses. From time to time it announces there will be no speaking exercises for 15 mins for no apparent reason. It's a shame as there's not enough speaking exercises and too many fiddly placement of words.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It gives a more stress and depression due to telling th√© correct answer to US but when we chose are write on the blank it tells wrong to us and this is not a very superb app to learn but good to understand.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,this app is so much better than others in my opinion because it helps learn language in very fun way. Also it doesn't allow you to jump on next chapter until you pass their test which will be revise for current chapter and it really helps you to learn with more focus so you can complete your lessons and move to next chapter.

Duolingo do you cover other areas of learning besides languages???"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Duolingo the last 4 years and more. The app, the experience etc. have changed quite a bit, mostly for the good, but what has remained consistent is the ability to help me learn languages with quick bite sized lessons. it's so easy to fit into my day even if I'm super busy sometimes. The reminders and widget are helpful. I can say I'm fairly confident to speak on Korean and Spanish, thanks to this cute (but scary) owl! I can also say Owl in atleast 7 languages too."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is a great way to learn different languages and keeps you doing it every day but is fun so it isn't boring and you look forward to doing it. I love this app and I have learnt so much very quickly and I have so much fun doing it.

I had Spanish in high school and a bit in college, but never spoken fluently. I did not try to learn Spanish again for over twenty years, but now I'm intermediate and my pronunciation is much better than it was in high school. My only complaint is that I would love more speaking questions. I also looked it when the podcast was linked to the app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been studying Japanese on my own for a month now. I can say that Duolingo is great for vocabulary & learning the basics of Japanese grammar so far. The only thing I'd like changed is how it teaches Hirigana, Katakana, etc.. After a few lessons of getting to know basic sentence structure, everything seems to halt & you're met with quite a few alphabet lessons before you continue. Adding small random alphabet tests within lessons would be a great way to break this up."

Also, chances to double your points. I'm no longer going to Spanish classes, so this keeps me going. It does have some South American words, but the grammar is the same. Also, when in mainland Spain, if you say the South American word instead, they know what you're saying. Just like we understand Americans. My husband also uses Duolingo"

It doesn't accept word which is given to you as part of sentence. To make it better, it's very complicated to contact support. And it's a huge battery drain! Over 500 days of testing..."

I feel I cannot even express my appreciation for this learning tool enough. Free to use for all to learn more about communicating with each other! Really, it makes me wonder why more people aren't learning from it! It's worth every minute versus what I might be doing on social media. This should be everywhere and everyone should try it once. Even though the base is free, paying for Super Duolingo is well worth it!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"While the gamification provides a quick start for absolute beginners, that's also where it ends. Duolingo's system of teaching Japanese is terrible. You practice whole sub-sentences as if they were one word without understanding their structure at all. So you'll be able to repeat Duolingo's sentences like a monkey. But you won't be able to construct your own sentences, because Duolingo does more harm than good by intentionally obfuscating the grammar."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very good app for learning. But the app is starting to act up ( I can't hear some of the words or sentences during chinese lessons to be able to answer the question). Also, it would be better if we had the option to not learn how to read or write, but instead just focus on how to listen and speak the language. But overall, it's a pretty good app. It just needs a bit more work to make it perfect."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Language professionals and know-it-all dorks will tell you that there are more comprehensive and 'serious' methods to learn a new language but it turns out that this is a fun and easy way to build learning into your daily routine. Whilst not perfect it provides a great way to learn whenever and wherever *you choose to. If you're realistic about your goals and resources then it can be a real help.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,unreliable - it often locks out. Bad that it's not Spanish but instead Latin American. plenty of words that are wrong if you're learning Spanish Spanish. similarly too in that it's American English and not proper English.

The only downside is I do not having a person to speak with in real life, so it makes it a bit tougher to speak fluently.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo used to be amazing for learning because you had a community of other learners and native speakers that you could discuss each example with. They removed all discussion boards and keep making changes that make this app worse and worse. Used to be highly recommended, but I no longer can in good faith. If you want to learn a language, look elsewhere. Duo is no more than a flashcard video game where you practice basic vocab. You won't learn the nuances of grammar and how to actually speak."

I just wish it gave more listen and speak ones where you listen to what it says and say it back. then it would be 5 stars üåü keep up the good work if you're learning a new language‚ô•üß°üíõüíöüíôüíú
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"One thing duolingo is doing well is keeping you engaged, returning and learning. Sadly as someone living in a country of which I'm trying to learn the language, I have to mention that what you learn language wise isn't necessary very helpful. I can say stupid things like ""the rhinoceros is my pet"", while I still lack the vocabulary to do something as mundane as asking for the way and understanding the reply."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"great app for learning languages, however i have had trouble with it not hearing what i'm saying properlywhen it asks me to speak into my mic. otherwise i think i've made significant progress in learning my language and the weekly leaderboards really keep me motivated to keep practicing so that i can get high placements."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Was a decent program for basic language concepts. With the current layoffs and their insistence on using AI it's hard to support their program any longer which is a shame.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Duolingo on and off since 2014. The older I get the more inspired & motivated I am to learn new languages, and Duolingo is a great starting point and a helpful tool to have accessable. Keeping up with + learning 4 languages at the moment (at my own pace), has been so much fun and much more productive than ""doom"" scrolling social media.. Lol. I highly recommend this app to anyone looking to learn or refresh themselves on language(s). Even 5-10 minutes a day is a start!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Constant music now plays over every screen. It plays over the ads, it's loud and it's annoying. Oh, and no more suggestions on the keyboard? What's up with that?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"doesn't quite teach a new language, due to the lack of grammar lessons, and doesn't quite explain why certain words are picked above others. but it works well for reinforcing the learning from actual lessons!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is good application for learning german Language. Bcz the system of this app is totally different and learning Language is easy &smooth. I appreciate them who create this application for the glob people.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The good: frequent reminders and rewards ensure you stick with the language; an excellent discipline tool The bad: their audio recording system often overlooks mono-syllable words and penalizes the user for it, it frequently gave me credit for saying words that I hadn't yet, and it marks me wrong for breaking nonexistent English grammar rules (I'm learning Korean). I have screenshots of the latter. There is no reply to requests for help Verdict: stay away unless you need the discipline support"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is an amazing language learning app I will give it 5 stars but there is a cheat in the game in the talking lessons when someone taps the microphone then listens to the text again the system will think you said it and let you pass please fix this cheat.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it's pretty cool, nice, and helps me learn. I'm learning Japanese, so that I can watch anime without using subtitles or putting it in English. and so I can have convos with people who speak it. but I kinda wish that they would let you redo a lesson. I can't remember all the words just like ""that"". so it would be really nice if Duolingo could make that happen. overall, from my experience, it's really a good app. I also love the duo memes! have fun w/ duo, I def recommend! <3"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,it's okay. but I don't like the pressure. also if I translate a sentence slightly different it's counted wrong even though it means the same.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Have to admit that the new learning system is slowly sticking to me. Practices are easier this way. Back to five stars... It would be nice if you could ad theorie at the start of a new learning line (like meervoud) so we don't have to learn by mistakes. Update: I can't use speech because I don't allow Google to access my microphone.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Allowing mistakes, more than five, is only possible through purchase which leaves learning stagnant for those on a budget. I enjoy the app, but dislike the restrictive nature and feeling punished for making mistakes. Edit: After about two and a half months of using this app I'm moving on to a different app geared more towards grammer and not penalizing me for mistakes. Thanks for the couple months. Salome."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Ive studied many languages through school and uni...I find this a good way to learn the way to speak a language in a way that is usable. I wish they had Afrikaans as a language to learn though. we have so many Afrikaans people on my country, it would be nice to be able to say few words."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it's been very helpful with its daily reminder and motivation. plus, correcting every exercise after every fail attempt. I've learned so much, which I recommend that others try it,even though it has ads,almost every time the lesson is done, none of the less, it is very good ."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo used to be great, but since they made the big update more than a year ago the experience of using Duolingo has gone down dramatically. You are forced to complete large sections of repetitive, monotonous lessons irrespective if you easily understood the concept. Previously you could choose how much time you spend on each topic, now everything just feels like a painful grind. I started hating doing lessons because it felt like I learned very little for the amount of time spent"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Hi Duo Developers. I am a paying Duolingo customer (Family plan). For the last few months, spoken exercises have been broken. Tried reinstalling, the app has mic permission, I can see the waveform animating as I speak, then I get the ""we won't show speaking exercises for 15 minutes"" message and it skips the exercise. Also, my first lesson of the day is getting lost. I did a lesson this morning, but this evening Duo tells me I haven't. I am loosing progress and it's frustrating. Fix, please?"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Please, I am begging, stop changing the structure of courses and moving me to random places within the new ones. Used to be a 5 star app for me. One star for overcomplication and unskippable ads. Revert to last year's format and stop the unskippable ads and we'll talk. In its current state, it's honestly really frustrating."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Overall, I like this app. I like that lessons are bite sized, and there is a wide choice in languages. However, I find the sudden use of many new words challenging to remember. I have also found that the lack of verb tables makes it's so hard to remember the verb endings."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Fun way to learn a new language. Feels more like a game than a language lesson. Interactive UI is easy to use and motivating. I compete with my friends on who gets to the highest league in the language of their choice. I myself need engineer level language for my studies but my skill level was below beginner. Now I'm finally able to raise my skill in swedish.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it's great. duolingo helped me learn Italian easily, and I'm glad it has so many options for languages and that you can learn multiple languages at one time so yeah great app!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Duolingo may not be perfect for language learning but this will keep you exposed to your target language and make learning fun and easy. I know I sound like an ad but this is true.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm learning Japanese and it is going pretty good, I like that they added the kanji section, but I don't like the ""path"" system and that they almost forgot about the theory of the language in the summary of each level. Now it's just a bunch and examples and that's all. Also I would like to have the meaning of the word in the ""first time word sound exercises"". One of the best apps to learn by repetition though. I pay the premium and I'm quite happy with it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app is okay if you want to learn a language for free but it has done glaring issues. For one it doesn't teach you anything. Wonder why you got something wrong? Too bad you've just lost a life. Basics such as grammar explanations are non existent unless you actively search for them rather than being taught them before the actual lessons. Also you will be presented with conversations you will NEVER have in real life. Also also Duo will pester you everyday to keep up your streak.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,this app is very amazingü§© I like it when Duo teaches me how to do Korean. but you guys still have to fix some stuff. some audio's seems confusingüßê. when I say it right in the audio it still says wrong. but there's always the next time and can you guys decrease your hour of Hearts? it would be very appreciatedüëç. id say like 2 hours for a heart to come back. thank you for making this app!!üòÜ I started Duolingo somewhere in May 2022.

Duolingo is the best i learn more than 20 wrds a day,I have been taking french calsses but their were so boring i really didnt feel entirdained i felt so bad that i spent the 6hrs in class and i never got anything,thanks to duolingo all i do is study now i speak 5 languages all thanks to duolingoü•∞ü•∞and 1 more thing i hade problems differenctiating (un,une,),(et,est) they were so confusing and i didnt now when,how and were to use these,thnx."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I usually don't write reviews on apps but this is an exception. I'd say it's a great app. In the language I'm learning, I used to only know a few words and that's it. This app has taught me to read and understand a language I had little experience with. I can understand people walking by me speaking. It is really cool. The only thing that bothers me is the 5 hearts, but even that can help motivate you from making mistakes. I say if you are debating on getting the app, try it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Love the app, about to hit the 365days streak. The reason for 3 stars is that since the update about a year ago, learning is incredible boring. I remember when it was possible to have multiple lessons ready to go, there were levels, and you had to have enough stars for the next lesson. Now it's SOOO boring, but still useful. Why did you update ? I used to be a premium member, I'm not gonna give money to be bored to death doing 6 lesson with the same thing over and over."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app! Grateful for the lessons and reminders. It's a great way to learn the basics while supplementing with additional media and exposure.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, even paid for the ""Super"" but I haven't been able to load in for days. Keep getting stuck on the load screen. I've uninstalled and reinstalled several times. I've restarted my phone several times. I've reported this to ""customer support"" several times. No change. Wasted money"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've enjoyed the interactive program. its fun and easy to use but also creates a good environment for learning. its actually really helped me to get a real taste to challenge myself & learn Spanish. I also believe its tapped into my memory recall & I'm aware its made a positive difference to my mental cognitive function, just as the research shows. Great stuff Duolingo, I will keep my 11 day streak going."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Some translations are wrong. In my Korean course they call the word for green, blue. Also there are only senteces & words but no explanation. For example the Korean word for THAT is Guh. However Koreans also use it to mean THE. The worst part is they never respond to any questions; so you can't communicate with them. They do not fix problems. You will need other resources than this one app to learn properly. It is free but to use the penalty free SUPER DUOLINGO it will be $89. up front."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Being very interested in learning a specific language, going from zoom with a teacher then wanting to learn more words and keep on top of everything this app really surprises me with its ease of use and most importantly it is very accurate. Highly recommend. Only down side is how much the subscription is, but in the end, you want a great app. You should pay that little extra üôÇ"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Uninstalling Would enroll myself in language course online on different online platforms. Laying off people and using AI for translation. That's why people have been complaining about incorrect and contradictory results.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have changed my rating, and I thought you should make streaks optional. I have heard many people struggling to cope with this very mechanic. Same goes to me; I feel demotivated if I lose a streak (not because of skill issue, but more likely on hectic timeslot) and it will suck if they will just uninstall the app because of it. tl;dr MAKE STREAKS OPTIONAL In general, I loved the app visuals, but please, heed my call, Duo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Decent app for practicing a language, very game-ified but for me that works to keep up motivation. However since a recent update it freezes a lot at the conclusion of a lesson, and while restarting the app works, half the time my XP or bonuses aren't added which is very frustrating for the gaming aspect and has tanked my motivation to keep trying."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The speaking exercises worked for the first lesson I did but past that it doesn't register the words I say at all and it causes me to lose all my hearts every day. I don't have trouble speaking so I know I'm pronouncing the words correctly, and I've seen others online have the same issue."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The app itself is good but they try and trick you into clicking the wrong thing and subscribing to Super Duolingo. They make it sound like Super Duolingo is a monthly subscription you can cancel at anytime but then they take around ¬£60 out of your bank account for the entire yearly fee which they say is none refundable. BEWARE! Con artists
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It helps and teaches you what certain words mean but I need more help with the meanings. If that makes sense. you'll see when you download it.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is great I am doing so much better at learning French and other languages with Duolingo. it even reminds me to practice every day I love it it pushes me to do my best except it keeps telling me to get super Duolingo an that cost money
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love your approach to teaching. Simplified and easy to grasp, even easier in Super. Looking forward to subscribe to the monthly premium. Keep up the good work!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"""Adequate"" app. Doing Korean. I see a lot of inaccuracies in translations, unnatural phrases, and incorrect grammar in both Korean and English. Some audio isn't very clear. Not sure how other languages are but the Korean course needs improvement. Second edit: finding more and more inaccuracies especially regarding articles (a/an/the.) Exercises are way too repetitive. Needs more variety in terms of question type and instances of sentence patterns"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Lessons become very tough quickly. Not enough vocabulary review. Need more practice with verb tenses. I would like EVERY sentence read back to me in French so I can hear the language and read it at the same time. Writing & spelling come too soon. When learning a 2nd language writing comes last. And spelling in French.pffft! So many of the letters in words are silent. No lessons have been given on where to place the accents. Fortunately, these errors aren't counted wrong. It's free, big plus!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love Duolingo because it has helped me to learn more French and to say it fluently and I love to win and it's quite fun because normally when I'm learning French at school it's really hard and annoying so this really helps me be more confident and it always gives me lots of tries to Never Give Up and I love the face of Duolingo how to buy parents say if I get good at French I can get like a Stanley Cup and I love it because I can get rewards if I do really good it's just like the best thing üëç
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I find dulling to be a great opportunity to learn languages with a relatively easy interface and prompt information to ensure your mistakes can be used as a lesson to help.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is easily the best language learning program I've ever used. it teaches useful words and phrases that make it easy to engage in a conversation with a native speaker even when you are still in the early stages of learning your language. the user interface is easy to navigate and makes learning a new language feel like you are playing a game. I would recommend this to anyone looking to learn a language outside of their own for whatever reason. 10/10 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êA+ 1st place & totally top shelf!!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I can't see the leaderboard or do lightning rounds and had no reply to try and resolve the problem. That's really dented my motivation, because for me the lightly competitive nature was my favourite part, I also found the lightning round helped me with fluency. Also my version has no testing your pronunciation facility. After my initial enjoyment of the course, I'm very disappointed now, especially in the lack of any solution or response. I don't feel I'm getting my moneysworth."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"not too bad, too many commercials. they push Super Duo which costs money. you can't do a lot of lessons, reviews or correct mistakes without Super Duo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Please include the gender of words in gendered languages like German when you teach new words. Also include the gender of words in the words practice feature of Duolingo. It should say ""Der Tisch"" instead of just ""Tisch"" like it does at the present."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My original review was 4 stars. But I have changed it because the last couple updates have ruined the app. I play daily as I am planning to visit my son in Japan. I got moved to a second section and I am unable to go back to the first section. I had just started learning a part of that. Now I can't practice. Also I have now 3 times spent my ex points to buy power ups when I didn't want to. The new matching game is impossible to defeat and I used to consistently win with out using power ups
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tried to join SuperDuolingo, instead of taking monthly took the whole amount off me and didn't upgrade app - is still without extra features and with hearts. No response two days on for resolution and I'm out a chunk of money for nothing, but they took my money quick enough! when you do trials it updates to SuperDuolingo immediately so I know it can easily be done. Not impressed and waiting for refund!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've loved this app and used it for a long time since I'm learning German so I can study abroad, but I saw the duolingo Music and Math options and I can't access them on android. Please fix this."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Artificially slow and geared to make you THINK you're learning. I can see why people like it. It's technically sound, looks good, and has rewarding sound effects. But it's not teaching Japanese, it's forcing you to learn slowly so you feel satisfied and feel rewarded. There is very very little spaced repetition. On with the next thing, who cares if you remember stuff from last week? It won't test you on it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I use Duolingo to learn Arabic and Turkish and it's wonderful to learn with this app. One thing to keep in mind is that Duolingo, the nature of it being an app, will not give you the in-person hands-on learning experience of a study abroad language program. But for what it is, it does an amazing job at it, I personally use it to maintain my level of Arabic."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is amazing for Spanish learning user and some other languages I say this because in other languages like Vietnamese it's isn't as organized as Spanish is however duo does teach you to say write and hear things correctly I would recommend this app for people interested in learning a new language
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a decent app for learning a language. Locking progression behind ""hearts"" is a very frustrating and annoying model. If I just want to do one lesson to maintain my learning streak, why do I have to take a break and come back because I missed one exercise too many? It makes me want to use the app less if I spend time running through a lesson just to reach the end and miss ONE question. Then I either have to SPEND money to keep learning, or retry in X amount of hours. Frustrating."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo has been helping me learn French for over 100 days. I really enjoy the fun characters, and the different kinds of activities mean you can learn more, without getting bored! 5/5 would recommend!"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's really good at gamifying language learning. I'm terrible at being consistent with things but I've been learning Japanese and I haven't missed a day in over two months!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Its a very good app for language learning. Its only drawback that I think which is its has no local languages. If you include local languges its great benifits for users. I suggest that includes mock test also in learning languages it helps users more beneficially.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am a severe epileptic person, and lately ive been in and out of hospital and duolingo wont stop sending me harrasing and upsetting messages to continue learning. When all im doing is trying to recover from an illness i cannot recover from. Now i have tried to unsubscrive over five times. Sent them to spam. I havent deleted my account in the case things cool down. Mean messages still comes But duolingo should consider that people may have honest reasons to call it quits because life happens."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This game is teaching me, and I really enjoy it! There is an exchange student who came to my school just a month ago. She is from Europe, Russia, and she is Belarusian. Instead of just saying ""hi"" as I walk past her, I wanted to make her feel welcome by learning to say hi in her language. So, I learned with duo. –ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç is hello in Russian. I lost control and started learning more than just that! I know so much now, thanks to the game. I can fully communicate and understand her now. THANK YOU DUO"

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,it's a very good app to learn whatever language you want to learn and specially busy scheduled person can also learn from here bcuz it'll only ask you for 10-15 mins a day and I think that's very easy and effortless way to learn any skill.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Not the best for a first time learner for a new language. It's all over in the beginning. I feel like it's good once you know the language to learn a bit more and maintain a good level, but not for the beginning"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,no ads apart from trying to get you to get duolingo+.You can also freeze your streak if you can not play.There are a variety of languages to choose from. if you are not English you can select your language and you can learn with your language.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I think it's a pretty good option than reading out of a dictionary and I can learn when I have time. I like it a lot. I wish it had minigames or something fun to play and learn
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is honestly amazing for learning new languages. The exercises help me learn new words super quickly and I've also been doing so much better in school thanks to it. But please let my family go, I'm begging you ü•≤"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,sometimes the screen on my program is not fully come to the front of my phone and I can't answer the questions because it's blocked because it hasn't loaded all the way up there's also a serious pause involved when you don't agree for the in-app purchase
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's such a great app for learning new languages but -1 star because YALL REMOVED THE FEATURE TO SET A PROFILE PICTURE?! And now all you get is a poor choice of pretty ugly avatars. It'd be nicer if you were just able to set a profile picture again. I opened the avatar by accident and now mine is gone :( You guys should fix that!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A great app to keep you motivated to practice learning your language daily. The fact it's a game keeps you hooked, it's hard to imagine that it's also helping you!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A fabulous (and free) language learning app, many thanks for teaching me my native Welsh language along with Greek Latin and Spanish, why you may ask ? It's there to be used, learn and teach. Enjoy all the languages available, spreading the word to the world."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am learning French just for the fun of it. I have tried before with books and CDs but did not succeed. Duo Lingo, however, is fun. I have learnt much more in the past few days than ever before."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is an amazing app for introducing someone to a language, supplementing studies, or rekindling an atrophied language skill. I recommend anyone interested in studying a language, give Duolingo a try."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Widget no longer shows me if I haven't done today's lesson. It used to update every day to tell me but it just shows that I'm up to date until I press on it. Once I do, and then back out, I see the disappointed bird."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,great app!! it really helped me learn the language I wanted to learn! although I didn't give it 5 stars because of the reason that it doesn't teach you the most practical things in the beginning. But I would definitely recommend!! ü©∑ü©∑ü©∑
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It is difficult to get started with the free version and maintain as a learner due to the number of hearts, freezes, etc provided."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is a very useful application, easy to understand and use with so many fun exercises. I would've loved to publish a review in the language I am learning (Dutch). Ik ben enn man en ik eet broadüòÇ"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Just got cut off after 395 straight days I pay for my account. Sent an email to Duolingo and got an auto reply!! Asking me to submit another mail to purchase department. I have no clue how to do that. Apparently you don't get to speak to or get a response from a human being anymore. Very poor customer service! I'm not calling an expensive overseas number which probably has an automated system anyway. Very cross!!!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Used to be much better with far more expressions and vocabulary. I would NOT recommend Duo at this point. Seek alternative. Looking forward to my subscription being over so that I can seek alternative
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Easy to learn, especially if you stick to it every day for at least 10-15 minutes. Noticable difference after 2 weeks of steady practice."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is a very nice app! Just one small suggestion, add more languages like Sanskrit, as it will increase your Indian audience. Also remove some of the fake languages like, really, KLINGON? HIGH VALYRIAN? But otherwise, good job!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I noticed my social media screen time to be way to high and learned through a Ted talk how duo uses those *addictive* principles of socials to keep users engaged. I find it does a great job competing for my attention and I always feel better being addicted to learned a language than to my socials:) thanks!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very good app for learning.It is for free though and it encourages you to keep the learning day streak for learning the language. I'm right now learning Japanese and it's helping me a lot
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is great, but they removed the comments section, where one could ask questions and find explanations about the sentence. I subscribed to the Super Duolingo to see, but it's not working either. It was the most useful function of the app. There's no possibility to find explanations anymore. A bit disappointing..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am learning so fast and I can do the hard things in Duolingo and it only been weeks since I installed Duolingo. Duolingo is the best you should installed it, you won't regret it. Just kidding if you don't practice they will kidnap you and it's fr (if you know you know)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing. I stated learning Spanishüá™üá∏ a few weeks ago a learnt many new words. The only problem is the lives but other than that, it's really good, definitely recommend itüòÄ"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It is a terrible app with too many adverts, and it doesn't prepare you for it at all. Only written words and the tenses are presented as hard and confusing. It is an insanely overated app, and I recommend not using it at all. It is addictive and I would say it's better to do anything else. It is completely terrible and should be removed from the appstore. It removed my 219-day steak when I had 3 streak freezes for no reason ."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is very good üëç but the one thing is that there is no shona course [ my home language]. 2) Also there is no Afrikaans. Please update that, then it would be so helpful."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This provides a lot of repetition to help you recognize and learn a language. You can only go so far every day unless you pay for more lessons. It's ok for what it is and it takes a long time so be prepared to devote your time every day.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Beautiful, I love that there is a widget that literally just *shows* you your streak. That way you don't have to use a streak freeze or lose your streak. (Just so you know I think all the memes that are made about you is untrue, exept for the ones make lol)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Learning with duolingo is an incredible experience. This app effectively provides you with the language skills. I enjoy learning Turkish from it a lot.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Best language learning app. the lessons are beautifully designed. the reputation of words and tasks makes you learn the words permanently. thank you for this beautiful app.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Took the free trial and didn't notify me two days before it ended like it said it would. Just charged 100 dollars for a year with both Google and duolingo refusing any refund even though it's only been a day. I guess they can only make money by scamming?
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"A good grounding, but not really able to practice speaking enough, difficulty raises quite quickly with little reference, also topics are a bit unrelated to what a beginner really needs.."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Constantly struggling to play audio, ""type what you hear"" then nothing plays. Happens every session, and makes progress impossible."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Good to have when you need to get familiar with the language for example a trip but not very effective if you want to learn a whole language. Some of the recordings are just bad and very low quality for example every recording in the latin course is just bad while in other ones like french the sound is perfectly good. You should put just as much effort in every course not only the popular ones. There is a reason why they have less learners than other.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I like it. The app drills you to the point where you read in the language you learn and your brain immediately decrypts the word/phrase. Very helpful and easy
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"it's a good app for learning, I try to speak in the exercise and it doesn't work. Lately, the app has not been responding to my mobile data and am about to lose my streaküò≠"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app because this app helps you get your new knowledge.....Awesome software for effective learning of new languages....My favourite feature of Duolingo is that it tracks your progress really well.....
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I really love the Chinese course it's actually so good. But the Korean course I cannot say the same. Although I took the lessons I cannot say that I learned something except to match according to the sound.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Offensive emails sent to you if you miss a day or it's been a few hours since you used the app. You get called a loser, and quitter and it bombards your inbox it's the most annoying app. Also the lessons are really slow and waaaaaaay too many adds."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Love the app so that would be 5 stars but after purchasing family plan nothing I did actually added family members nor did I ever get a response from them to my raising my hand and asking for help. Exasperated, I asked for a refund and they responded. LOVE the app, just not the support that should be with it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it's helped me so much with general talking and writing! (such as vocabulary, pronunciation, conjugation and grammar) honestly I haven't found much wrong with the app. therefore full marks!!! üòÅüòÅü¶â"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've chosen to do 10 minutes a day Japanese. I love it. It's at my pace. The options to re listen, go slowly and undo mistakes are great."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is an okay app but if you shop losing it it takes you back to the beginning and does not remember any of your past progress which is frustrating.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Deleted my old review for a new review of the update: EVEN WORSE somehow. yay, we have new icons and graphics to congratulate us for every question we answer, but the entire app is still broken. I wish I had stopped using duolingo months ago, but instead I'm at a high enough streak that I don't want to just quit, so I'm stuck NOT learning a language and answering bad practice questions on a nonfunctional app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Changed to a 2star review because of your ad system. Love the app even though the purple text and sometimes pronunciations are wrong. But your ""super duo lingo"" ads replaying after I hit not now, allowing ads that don't have an obvious one click X (example: a play button or arrows to to access 2nd part of ad), and now you have to sit through 2 15s+ ads anytime you do something outside of completing a normal lesson is absurd. App went downhill at the end of 2023 but hopefully 2024 will be better"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"All this app needs is interactive notifications. When you normally recieve text via cellphone, there are multiple choice auto-responses within the notification to help speed up the process. Duolingo, I would truly love to learn new languages, but constantly on the phone researching other things- If the app simply sent notification games and passages in the chosen language with subtitles, it would be a breeze to multi-task and evolve the purpose of the reminder. An overlay of bubbles to do othe"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I tried a lot of language apps, but this is the only one I've stuck to because of the way they try and gamify learning. Plus it's free. If you just want to casually learn another language, this is probably the best app. Edit, over a year of regular use later, and this is still one of my favorite learning apps. Currently learning Dutch and French. I travel a lot and was able to recognize a little of the Dutch and French convos I heard even with only an average of 5 mins a day of app usage."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app, I recommend adding the widget to your home screen because it motivates you to do a lesson so you don't break you streak, and some of them are hilariousüòÅ"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"WHY DUOO Today I'd be going on a return flight and when I was ABOUT to do my lesson, it crashed. The system told me that I needed to update it and when i went here.. it only said ""open."" But overall, with the lessons, it's awesome."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The most addicting / fun app so far for learning in my opinion! I have A.D.D. but this app keeps me focused on it because its actually fun! I love competing with friends & trying to get a good score & in the shortest amount of time that I can. I really appreciate this app for its design especially because of my focusing issues, making this app fun is what has helped me a ton to not give up on learning new languages. I also love that its free but also has options to become ad free & more perks!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Recently the app has been full of errors and i see no improvement, even though i report them every time. Very disappointing, seems like the ai they are using is completely useless and makes the app worse by the day."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,So frustrated with the streak errors. On 3 separate occasions I completed a lesson. The next day I was informed that a streak freeze had been used becuse I didn't complete a lesson the previous day even though I had. It has been beyond frustrating. I reached out to duolingo about this problem multiple times and have heard nothing back at all.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"(Spanish Course) As a paying user, I would expect way better than this. No word lists, no structure, translations rarely given, correct answers not accepted. Progress goes forwards and backwards frequently after updates. How are you supposed to learn with no proper explanations? This app use to have translations, vocab lists, explanations within lessons... Now its all gone. I Will be cancelling unless improvement is made prior to my next renewal. Can no longer recommend this app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The combination of reading and listening, along with the variety of languages is very nice. The gamification components are good for competitive learners. One complaint they have made a few updates to the learning paths which shuffled the order words and concepts were learned which was frustrating for a bit to figure out what was introduced and what was moved to later in the path."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I've loved it for years as a tool to learn French. Duo is very encouraging and it's great having super! However to my chagrin the default English is American and not British. It would be nice to have that option as I have made mistakes because of it such as using cinema (movie theater) and holiday (vacation). Super Duolingo is helpful.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,They make it fun and the repetition helps information really stick. Making that small commitment every day makes it feel rather easy as well!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have used Duolingo on and off for 7-8 years, and as time goes on, both translation quality and feature accessibility have diminished immensely. As of 2024 Duolingo has laid off staff for worse computer AI translations. Unless you intend on microtransaction-ing your way through elementary language learning, you won't have vocabulary lists, fundamental learning features such as conservation listening and coursewide review modes, and every single lesson will inundate you with ads, costing focus."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is intelligently designed. It encourages me to do some learning exercises every day so as to maintain my daily streak. The app is not annoying, it focuses on encouraging a commitment to learning. I highly appreciate that I can learn without having to enter my credit card. I will eventually subscribe to support such a great product."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is amazing now that it follows the Common European Framework of Reference. I love the variety of listening, speaking, reading, and writing lessons. I can't believe how much my German has improved with Duolingo's regularly throwing in vocabulary or grammatical concepts that I have difficulty with so that I get them. I've learned more using Duolingo than I did in 4 years of high school German."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really like the lessons but I hate all the extra stuff like badges and hearts. The steaks would be nice if it actually kept track of your real steak instead of letting you ""freeze"". Simple stats like total days/hours, real streak, and accuracy that can measure progress in a straightforward way would be funner than all this made up stuff that makes it feel like a kids game. I'd give it 5 stars and even pay for the premium version If I could turn off all the fluff."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I think it was much better in its previous years, its layout was more user friendly, with helpful icons for subjects if you wanted/needed to practice a specific topic, it emphasised more on things you might say day-to-day alot more than it does now.. its trying to teach me about what ""the board of a company might get rejected by the stakeholders"", but I don't know how to ask ""where is the toilet"" - come on, I mean, I don't talk about Latin philosophy or medical procedures in my own language!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Great app but important features keep changing. I have paid for Super Duo with my partner. She is on iOS while I am Android. She regularly gets product features I don't. And they have just taken away the ability to read user comments on questions which was a significant learning tool for me. No notice or anything. Features just disappear overnight.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have been learning various languages with duolingo and it have been a best experience since last 3 years. Recommend every language learner to use this app for further polishing their language of interest
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duo is repetitive in a way that makes it fun and easy to keep learning with. I love that you have the option to select what type of learning you need to work on based on what you need help with whether it is speaking, listening, or typing. The daily streak on there is also a good way of encouraging you to keep at it daily, especially for retention."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love that it's free but the new format isn't for me. I like having control of what I learn and the stories made it easier to learn conversational parts of the languages. Plus, the limited access to gems along with the expensive ""cost"" of things using gems, makes it less enjoyable."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Ignore any review more than a few months old, since this app has changed a lot since then. It has become a language-themed game, rather than an app to learn languages. You can probably learn an easy language like Spanish or French, but not harder languages (like Russian or Finnish). It doesn't teach grammar at all, and only popular languages (like SP, FR, or EN) have some tips. It's decent for practice, or if you like to play games."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is Amazing. Its got really cool user interface. Its lessons are really easy to understand. I have to say though, I look foward to chinese course updates. Character languages are difficult to learn on duolingo. They've added a section for learning Pinyin. I wish they'd do the same for Hanzi. They've improved a lot since my last review. I still look forward to when we can have stories on Duolino Chinese like other courses."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Very helpful. Easy to use. Lessons are separated into categories to make learning simpler yet fun. You can even share your progress with others who use the app.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Nixed features of overall cheapskate decisions from the company make it no more than an entertaining game. No longer a good language learning tool. Have sent several dozen complaints in the app to crickets. I will not be renewing my subscription.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good but needs to be improved. Like I am learning Spanish and there are many confusions like: pez/pescado; vosotros/ustedes and many more. So there should be a section where we can find the answers of many confusion.But, The app is like a 5‚≠ê game. Some updates should come."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"useful to hear the language spoken. also to gain some vocabulary. no grammar explanations. pointless sentences like.. ""I am a cloud."" or ""The fish bites the bicycle."". Waste of time those sentences. if you have a native speaker to talk with using the acquired vocabulary, and to hopefully help make sense of grammar usage, then this can be a beneficial tool. if you expect much more than acquiring some vocabulary and hearing pronunciation, then you'll be disappointed."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love this app but it's also hard to make significant progress as it feels like the tree goes on and on. Also the guidebooks are never helpful! BRING BACK THE COMMENTS!!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The application is really helpful and I enjoy the exercises. But it's really annoying to see the counters (points and jewels) not counting all. sometimes it's just a refresh problem and it has to restart the application. I've reported the counter points problem but nothing was happened.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, this app is really amazing. It also gives free trials from time to time! not like other apps. it has no issues tbh. perfect app for every age! must try!!!!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I'm getting interested about learning Spanish and I know a lot a bit by the app called Doulingo. its Amazing to learn Spanish and all languages. its like you are at school learning it. but I'm getting good at it w a bit? si I hope you like it?
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is so good. They added characters to make it friendly and an owl (Duo) who helps you in studying new languages and they also kept a system for learning every day I won't tell you, download it and check it out yourself"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app! The reason I didn't give it five stars is because even though it's great, it's not perfect. Some of the listening exercises pronounced the words weirdly, and when you type, there were some different translations that confused me. Also, I get it, Duolingo needs to make money, but I really hate the premium thing."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Fun free app with ads. I would like a bit more explanation when doing exercises, but it will give you the concepts needed to understand languages."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I completed the entire Latin course, and it never taught any verb forms other than active present (with the sole exception of ""was born""). Also, the vocabulary was... strange; they teach you obscure words like ""weasel"" and ""lararium"", but they never get around to basic words like ""hear"", ""here"", ""feel"", ""door"", or ""goodbye"". Also, there is not enough variety in the sentences given."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It can be helpful in some regards, but the life system for mistakes is creating more stress than necessary. I get that they want to make money by making people pay for premium, but giving the user five mistakes is removing the entire use of the app. This also makes it more challenging to complete daily quests for no good reason, nobody is going to want to wait hours to gain their lives back when they could just use a different app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really love this app but Could you please include more African languages like Igbo, I've been looking for an app to learn igbo, my mother tongue, but I couldn't find the right one, nevertheless I know that if Duolingo includes igbo language üá≥üá¨, I don't need to look further."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,i like Duo. it teaches u a lot. and the fact it gives u challenges to not make the game boring. there is always another hurdle to pass and makes u want to keep going. i love this upgraded version. i can only see the app getting better and would 100% recommend it teaches u a lot in a short space of time. my only wish is that you allow us to buy double xp. üòä
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"been using it for 3 weeks now and it's pretty good. some of the translations are a bit off but I think it comes down to dialects (Norsk). The oral practice can fail often due to background noise so you should try to practice in a quiet setting. Overall, it's a good starting platform to get very basic conversational phrases but lacks in certain areas such as grammatical rules."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am currently learning Japanese through this app. I find it very engaging and I use it every day. The lesson are fun to do and I really enjoy the league system, this adds a nice competitive feel to the app. The friend system is also fun, I enjoy doing quests with my friends. Overall, I think that this is a great app and people should use this app if they want to learn the basics of a language. It is useful to learn basics of a language but, I have heard that it isn't the best to become fluent."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Non-stop ads and now a limit of how much you can use it. Expensive subscription which pays for fake reviews. Trying to learn German and its only pictures of people in turbans. I'm getting a book because these language learning apps are just garbage now.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Lately, the ads suddenly plays itself during the lesson, but only the sound/music. So the lesson is still in effect, but with the backsound of the ads, so i cannot hear anything else about the lesson because the music is too loud and it won't stop, it is happened so many time i had to force closed the app everytime it happen The ads is chrom valley custom game, please fix it."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been using the app for nearly a year now, and level of frustration has reached a critical point. Having constant changes in the app and rewards is not fun. Quality of the content is getting worse by the unit. I am past the middle of my Japanese course, and English translations are atrocious, make no sense and often are grammatically incorrect. They have taken discussion threads away, which was a major help for me, as well as simply fun thing to read. The content is getting more woke too smh"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"If you take anything from this brief review, may it be that Duolingo will not teach you a language. Trust it from someone who has studied seven. It is useful as a side project for learning vocab, but little else. It won't teach you grammar effectively (although for this it is better on PC, as you can bring up grammar tables and explications) and it teaches you the bizarrest phrases. My advice would be to do a course or to buy a grammar & exercise book. Duolingo is only a subsidiary tool."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app for learning new languages, and it's well done in terms of design. My one problem with it is that during the speaking lessons, it won't pick up on my voice at times, and I'll get it incorrect for not saying the full sentence despite the fact that I did say it. Other than that, it's a great app! Definitely recommend it!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app does take a gamified approach to language learning with its leagues system, but even that doesn't work well. Between A/B testing of points systems giving someone players an advantage over others and bugs which prevent your top 3 finishes from counting on your profile it's no wonder this app is on the bottom of most YouTuber's lists. But hey at least it's free."

"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Literally best app to learn languages. But, my only issue is that you get so much more when you use Duolingo on an Apple device and it feels unfair the amount of attention Duolingo gives to Apple devices compared to the web version and the Andriod version. Will easily change this into a 5 star if I feel like it's more balanced between the versions"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Its an useful app in general but here are few problems: 1. You will only have a positive experience when using a paid version. The app is designed to make your life hell if you want to use it for free 2. Even with the paid version it is designed to increase your using time by designing errors on purpose for example when I supposed to have 2x exp but it doesnt add to my account or when doing exam it rejects my correct answers so I have to retake them multiple time. Its frustrating
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"In terms of Arabic I can't see translation on screen very often, only Arabic and matching this with phonetic Arabic using Wrstern alphabet, so... often I don't know what the words mean. But I am still enjoying it. Thank you for the App ‚úÖÔ∏è"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"duolingo has greatly improved over the last few years, especially in the listening exercises. And I'm super thankful for the stories in some of the languages - they are super useful and great pedogically! Thanks for all the behind the scenes work you guys do that we on the front end take for granted - rejoice in your great work! thanks so much!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a app that will help you learn multiple languages in a fun way, It targets multiple learning styles. I would recommend this app for anyone who's currently learning a foriegn language in school and needs extra reinforcements that will make you go beyond. I think the app could be enhanced by providing content to read or browse through before interacting with the interactive learning content, the app could also send you notifications about new words, phrases, definitions through out the day."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Pushing off translation from real translators to AI to generate more profit and removing support for endangered languages when they specifically claim they are keeping endangered languages alive is false advertising. There are better, more ethical alternatives to what is now becoming no better than automatic translation. Goodbye Duo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"like the learning game, but find the constant barage of trying to get you to take a free period of time really annoying. The problem with that is that even though it's free for that time, you still have to put your bank details in... it should just be free from the start, and once the time is up, then revert to adverts or payment. otherwise, it feels like a sales trap."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I will update my previous statement made on X .. This is a rather helpful app , Depending on what you're needing to do. I highly recommend doing the trial & Super with it after the first Rookie section. If you are trying 2 learn A.F.A.P get super turn on ‚ôæÔ∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è ability in preference/profile . Just get all that U can from it and actually Learn .. I plan 2 do , French , Latin, Italian, Russ., & Japanese, Chinese. However, I do feel I may need to resort 2 bab or Rosetta 4 those.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A very clever set up! I have begun to practice on Duolingo in the morning instead of doom scrolling and it's working! Easy to navigate! Fun little memory games that help the material to stick through repetition posed as a fun little game. ""I'm too old to learn a new language."" This is a great start! So easy that children can navigate it! ü•∞üó∫Ô∏è"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Recent update removed the 2XP time left info from the Home screen (used to be available when you clicked a lesson). The word list needs to be easily accessible and exportable. I have learned 1000 words apparently but don't have a list that I can easily work with. There needs to be a way to mark an exercise as done or easy in the review section. The review gets repetitive very quickly.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There is a bug in the Spanish course that keeps deleting my progress- often bringing me back an entire section. I emailed about it about a month ago and nothing has been done. I've lost my motivation to use this app when I can't move forward in learning anyways, and I definitely will not be paying for premium Duolingo. Sadly I'm thinking I should start looking for a new language app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is one of the best language app I've ever used. During my time in high school, Duo helped me so much so that I improved in Spanish. I even recommended it to my classmates and their grades improved as well. Sometimes I might be too lazy to practice but the app always remind me that I can always take 5 minutes of practice."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm going to sound like a bot but, I never thought I'd learn a new language. this program turns it into a game with repetitive learning. the more popular the language the better contribution to putting the lessons together for us to use. just like with everything else this will only get you so far. you'll need supplemental materials or experiences for fluency. 10/10 and I do recommend"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely amazing app. The #1 language learning app. I recommend to everyone. Duolingo has such good techniech and programming to teach you the app in a very easy playful follow along manner. I love it, have been going for over 300 days. All is can say is download it now if you want to learn pretty much any language. You'll love it. It's also 100% free and you get all the features you need in the free plan."

Honestly speaking, it's fun, interested and very much helpful for the beginners, especially for school going kids it's really interesting and encouraging. But for me it's very easy..

"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"A nasty money grab app. You complete a lesson (takes about 3 minutes) then have to watch an unskippable 30 second ad. If you make 5 mistakes in a day you can't do more learning unless you refill your ""hearts"" by watching more ads or buying ""gems"" (with real money). It also constantly prompts you to join their subscription plan, which costs the same per month as premium netflix!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I love the app and play daily but lately it is very glitchy. I complete a level and it freezes before giving me the points or progress. The only way I can get past the frozen screen is to keep forcing the app to stop then re-opening it. So I'm losing a lot of points when it re-opens. Please fix!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love the app but I think that some small changes can improve it a lot. Like: 1. It would be nice to include Listening and Practicing in the achivements. 2. Adding vocabulary and grammar to the practicing section. 3. For the achivements I would add a progress bar because it can be discouraging not knowing the next milestone.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo Super was a mistake. Unlimited lives make your eyes glaze over. You can turn off unlimited lives, but the practice button to earn more is completely gone. Until you run out, and then you can click it once to gain a single heart, and then it goes away forever again until you lose the heart. Also Duolingo is REALLY subpar with teaching certain cases and grammar. THE discussion section HELPED WITH THAT, but it's gone now. Of course Duolingo has a reason, but they 100% made the app worse."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a great app for learning languages! It's fun because you can do lessons and read/listen to stories. You learn to understand, write and speak the language you chose to learn. However, I have to deduct 1 star because if you don't buy 'super duolingo' you have to watch Adds after every lesson, you only have 5 hearts etc. It's like you have to buy it or otherwise you'll need much longer to master a language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It doesn't accept good answers, when translating from Italian to French they want you to understand the implicit subject (Ils, Elles) and they consider an error if you do not guess it right."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The tournaments are full of cheaters and Duolingo does NOTHING about it. It's a complete morale breaker. Shame on you. The courses are very helpful despite this and I highly recommend it as a leaning tool but don't waste any of your money on it until they provide actual support. They aren't earning the money they charge for Super Duolingo. It's a bad investment. Stick with free and it will be more than enough.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,honestly I am a 11 year old learning french and I just started yesterday and I can already construct sentences in french try Duolingo it's the best app to learn a language but I honestly think Duolingo should add for South African languages but other than that Duolingo is such a good app DOWNLOAD IT RIGHT NOW‚ÄºÔ∏è
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this program for 200 days now and with the consistency I'm surprised at how much I have learned when I knew zero Spanish when I started. I'm having fun and then motivated to keep consistent and growing in my new language for personal interest. I am surprised at how I am also learning grammar concepts rather painlessly. However, the true test will come with trying to speak with natives speakers spontaneously"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This used to be better when they at least allowed you to look at a discussion people had done years ago. Even though I couldn't ask, I could at least look and see what other people had said as the reasons/grammar behind a wrong answer. Now it just tells you it's wrong with neither feedback nor a discussion, and expects you to figure it out. Often they give 2 potential answers in which either could be correct, and mark the one that's more fitting as wrong. The paid version is just as bad"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app could have been curated in a better way in respect with its response time and features, as sometimes the app freezes while playing the famous 'Daily Challenge'. It also fails to deliver proper audio lessons at times. But nonetheless, this is a great app, with a bit of bugs üêõüêõ, but I am sure that the developers will squash them at the earliest as possible, alongwith the aforementioned issues."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Using this to revive my previously good French OK for this purpose, ads can be irritating, but that's to be expected it's how they pressure people into paying to go ad free. More irritating is the use of US English, not only words, eg. check vs bill, but also poor grammar, and clunky translation that no native English speaker would use. It's almost as if I'm working in 3 languages at the same time, translate English to stilted ""American"" and then the American to French, and vice versa"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,such a wonderful app for learningüíØüíØ I think it Would be a lot better if we get to communicate with our followers just like any other social media app... Should help speed up the learning process if we can chat in different languages as well
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I really like the app and im learning Spanish and French and this app makes it fun but the only annoying thing are the hearts since you only get 5 then you can only make 5 mistakes before you have to wait 1 hour+ to continue but I really recommend if you want to learn basic languages. but to me it's also dumb that you can only learn certain languages
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Randomly decides to mark answers wrong, even when words are spelled correctly. For example in german it randomly decides the word lehrer/lehrerin is incorrect and that dozentin is right despite that word not having been introduced and the hint showing lehrer as the correct translation. There also isn't a way to set up any kind of vacation so if you take a week off you lose your streak. Dropped to one star because of the 3am notifications that I have full hearts. I have never done a lesson at 3am"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Really good helper app for language learning. Functionally there are very few issues - and the UI has evolved tremendously to remain modern and aesthetically pleasing. It's worth noting that I only study a couple of the less obscure languages (French, Spanish, occasionally Mandarin) so my user experience might be more pleasant than others'. I would suggest adding more features for listening practice. Other than that, thanksüëå"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Given 1 star because of all the courses they're no longer updating, including the one I'm taking. Otherwise, a good tool. Can't be your only tool for learning a language, but a great way to start/practice. The desktop app, where you must type on the keyboard, is by FAR the best for actual learning. The mobile app is a good way to be able to take it everywhere with you/practice on busier days. I recommend doing at least the legendary challenges on desktop and writing down the phrases you miss"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I don't like the approach how the process of learning of the new words in Deutsch organized. The words are given without articles! The app doesn't give no grammar explanation. Nevertheless, I'm already too involved and in the middle of the course. It gives benefits for learning in any case. But just an addon to the main learning."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,You can dedicate as little or as much time you want but once you get going you realize you're having fun and learning. Just start to plan who to practice with when you learn all these new words and phrases.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been using duolingo for more than a year, I personally love duolingo because of its cool interface and stories with cute characters, also the fact that it has weekly grammar newsletters and info. The only thing is that you get to a point in duolingo where they stop teaching you grammar and you have to figure it out for yourself unless you have duolingo max, and some phrases are repeated"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo recently erased a bunch of my progress due to an update. Despite paying for premium service, Duolingo has non-existent customer support so it's generally impossible to solve problems like this."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Not the best to learn a language, as you are limited to the same words over and over, there is very little reading, no writing, obviously, listening only applies to short phrases or words, and so on. I think the best thing of the app is that it encourages you to learn through rewards... and shaming lol."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's amazing what Duolingo is doing for so many languages. I tried it out with several languages and some that I knew before. The imperfections are only minor issues that seem odd in the translations to your base language. The target language seems to be on point. Progress is easy and fun if you stick to it. An example of a weird translation: Italian ""Vai a piedi o in macchina?"" -> Base Language German ""Gehst du zu Fu√ü oder [f√§hrst du*] mit dem Auto?"" (*was missing)"

You literaly have nothing to lose. You can thank me late!! Enjoy your language learning journey. Remeber to be consistent. Rome wasn't built in a day."

And you get on, you have 2 hearts, and it says ""next heart in one hour"" like what? I haven't opened this app in 5 hours! Also, why do you introduce new words, and when I guess wrong, you take a heart? And yes, I meant to say guess because when you bring me a new word in a different language, how can you honestly expect me not to mess up? 5 new words in one lesson and now all my hearts are gone.

My ability to speak Espanol is impressing my Spanish speaking friends. I was tired of having to have a third party translate for me & even though I have many Spanish speaking friends & have tried for years to learn the language It never stuck until Duolingo!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I enjoy Duolingo because it doesn't make learning a new language boring. It adds interesting elements and fun characters. it is an overall pleasant experience
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It becomes very expensive to get experience points. Basically it became a freemium application, if you don't invest money in it it becomes very difficult to compete against those who have the plus version. It became an application that encourages competition more than learning. Very bad."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,it's good you can learn many different type of languages. From this app we can learn while playing.one of the best app I have used so interesting and informative . Easy to use children can also use this while playing

It is a very fun and friendly approach to learning a language, and I've never tried to learn another language before. I'm 90 days into the lessons and am amazed at how many words I am already understanding. I definitely like how the app identifies your weak areas and helps you improve on them. You can learn a lot from this app!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"A very good app for learning a new language, although the Spanish is a little too south American rather than European.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"a fun and interesting SUPPLEMENT for learning a language. The fact is this cannot be the end all, be all, of learning any language, however, this is an excellent way of keeping your brain active by learning something new. If you wish to entertain yourself with education, try this. If you wish to replace a bad habit with something else, try this. If you want to learn a language, try this, but also find ways to speak with someone fluent, cause this lacks that nuance that comes with fluency."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This is a pretty good way to learn and practice a language. My only frustration is the speaking portion. My wife is Korean and even she cannot get some of the speaking parts correct. I think that part of the app needs to be developed more.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"it is decent enough, it's you can learn a lot but there are a lot of irritating features like the league's and leaderboards etc. I don't care what others are doing. They change my course a lot which is frustrating but I'm of the belief that it's necessary for improvement. I have used this app for a long time yet am still not particularly confident in forming my own sentences, just repeating set phrases parrot style, I've supplemented with in person classes. paid is only worth it if you hate ads."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Amazing app. This is one of the precious apps you would ever come across. Language learning is Fun and interesting. It really helps me in improving myself. Many thanks to the app developers and the team behind this work. Kudos to you all!!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Amazing for learning a new language! helps you so much and feels like a game! then you can add a fun widget that changes and reminds you to practice every day! the only thing is that you only have 5 hearts a day unless you go to premium. If you really wanna learn SUPER well then do premium but for my I'm just learning Italian for fun but otherwise 5/5
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good app to learn new words, but unfortunately the developers don't want to insert proper grammar. Many times I get the answer right just based on logic because all other options are obviously wrong and even a 5 years old could get it, otherwise many exercises would be impossible without real grammar. It doesn't take much to insert basics of grammar easily explained and more difficult options to choose from so that I would actually have to learn the grammar to pass a chapter.."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love the app! It appeals to my competitiveness with challenges etc. Certainly building the vocabulary! Only desire would be to have little explanations into the grammar and word changes or why is the phrase like this not that, rather than it just being spoken/writen phrases and being left to figure out the reason for changes. Still 5 star, love the app and learning far more than without ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The path is terrible and makes it where it is next to impossible to retain anything. On top of this it seems almost every time I start the app I am either thrown back multiple lessons because of new words added, or worse thrown forward for God knows why to where I have multiple lessons worth of words being used that I don't know. Duolingo aught to be ashamed of themselves. As soon as my subscription is finished they won't see another penny from me. Do yourself a favor don't download this app!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So I'm 2 weeks in to using this app and have to say I'm loving it. I don't give 5* reviews lightly. I'm learning Arabic from an English speakers perspective and I'm on Section 1 Unit 7, also doing the alphabet module. I have absolutely no problems with the repetition - with the timed tests and listening exercises its a fantastic way to learn in a pick up and play manner. I am subbed to Super because it's worth it if you're at all serious about nailing it down. Haven't missed a day since day 1."

Now in additionntonall my other problems, I keep having streak freezes used even though I've completed lessons that day. And now I can't even do my Spanish lessons. It's frozen and won't let me proceed. I've contacted Douling support almost a dozen times over the year and get no responces or solutions ever. At this point once my streak ends I'll never be coming back."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"A bloated mess of an app now. Far too game-ified and gimmicky so loading times are often painful and you get bombarded by endless stupid 'rewards' and challenges after completing a simple lesson. Rarely shown practise on words & phrases I struggle with, usually displays ones I breeze through. Many audio clips are spoken far too fast with bad pronunciation. App hangs and freezes far too often on Android. Too many nonsensical phrases of no use to anyone. Older versions were far superior."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Duolingo is amazing it is helping me with my Spanish and telling me when I'm wrong it is also fun it reminds you of your streak to keep you motivated. it also gives you rewards Duolingo is for everyone.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoy Duolingo. I'm currently taking Spanish, and it's great. They have a good consistency with repeating words and bringing in new ones at great times. I also love how you can just practice to get more hearts instead of having to wait, I think it's a great way to get people to practice and work on their skills. I only wish they had ASL, I've been looking for an app, and there just seem to be no good ones that you don't have to pay for, my only ask is to add ASL to the list of languages"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The app for Android is much improved compared to a few years ago when I first tried learning Japanese. It is more enjoyable and satisfying to use and I'm retaining more of what I'm learning.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like the fact that ..they implement new and exiting ways to teach you the language.. especially for me who has a short attention span this comes in pretty handy ..overall great app haven't experienced any adds, which I am thankful for"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Awesome game keeps you returning. Turning 3 years of only 15-30 minute sessions into genuine learning through reps, reps, reps with vocabulary and sentence structure. (If only a way to practice More speaking, would be greatly beneficial)."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Removing the word prediction has slowed my progress in app, typing is slower and I also don't need to memorize spelling for my particular learning needs. Let people choose to use it or not."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,it's good for getting the basics and some of the incentives to stay engaged are nice. There are a few cases where the things are not listed correctly and/or the leaderboards can get annoying. But if you pair this app with other learning methods and immersion it's worth the use.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Such a fun way to learn a new language but giving it a low rating because there is way too many ads which really takes away from the app experience.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been using the app for years, but it's getting worse. I miss the old learning tree, now learning path is extremely slow and focusing too much in grammar than useful phrases for travel. Only new good features are the lessons for learning non latin alphabets. However they are adding too much effort in useless features (ranks, feeds, xps) rather than adding new languages. Also, I really dislike that they say to help endangered languages, but they hide nice courses like Guarani and Esperanto."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"apart from the occasional bug and the slightly B tier support for languages I'm interested in, I really like this app. It's engaging without being overbearing and lets you get familiar with languages at your own pace."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've tried other language leaning apps an Duolingo has been my favorite. I love that there's a free version. I have been learning Spanish for over a year and like how you learn by listening, by translating from Spanish to English and vise versa, and they introduce new vocabulary slowly so you don't get overwhelmed. It's set up well."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Too repetitive - when you get the same answer right 10 times I switch off/bored and then get the answer wrong! Different sentences would be helpful. Maybe practical/everyday phrases. Some of the English sentences are incorrect. Not sure about learning American words and Brazilian Portuguese....otherwise a good basis....
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been a super subscriber for 18 months or so. The worst thing about the current iteration is the shameless efforts to get people already paying $80+ per year to spend extra money by making the special event games unwinnable. You have to buy gem packs to give you boosts or forget it. It seems every major update over the past year has been intended to squeeze as much money as possible out of users. Every time there's a significant change to the app, things go downhill. Don't waste your money."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I believe this is a five star app for how much you can learn for free but I'm giving it four stars. The app had an update early this year and it completely changed the layout. Now it's confusing to find previous clusters of useful learning material because you have to scroll so far back and check every lesson name. it was much easier before.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've used it for a year. It changes a lot, but unfortunately not for the better lately. On many occasions I've reported a bug that was ignored for more than a year now. It resembles mostly a game and beware that it is almost unusable with ads. I've learned a lot and feel like I can start learning properly now on my own. Cheers."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Duolingo for three years learning Italian and French. The app is very well made. You get to learn languages by answering questions, listening and talking. It includes brief explanations on grammar and rules but most of the time you'll be doing small size lessons that will build up with time while scoring points and competing with others as incentive."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"LOVE this app, the only thing I'm having a problem with is sometimes it won't hear me when it tests ur pronunciation and causes me to fail and lose hearts. That might need looking into."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The web version allows to change the order of the already placed words from the word bank. I want it here too! Why ""practice"" button is teaching me the basics, when I am already on section 3? One of super Duolingo's selling points is unlimited hearts. What? I already have them without the subscription. Also Why all of the new stuff in the unit is taught only in the last 3-4 levels? I want to learn new stuff, practice a bit and then skip the rest of practice. (I learn German from English)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a primary and basic language learning tool. In my view if you want to learn a new language, you can get the basic idea about a language from here, nothing else! if you want to master the language, I am not going to suggest you this!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am loving Duolingo. I got the family plan now my 4 kids and one of their friends are learning new languages, Spanish, french, Japanese, Russian and German. The courses are so engaging that they are all sticking with it. I will be renewing my annual subscription."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great for extending your vocabulary. Listening and understanding is hard particularly with some of the voice tones. There is a lot of repetition, which I get if you're learning, but if you keep getting 100% right is boring. I'm thinking of giving Babel another go. Also a warning this is Brazilian Portuguese not European. Despite the negative comments above Duolingo has improved my understanding of the language more than anything else in the last 2 years."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Not enough grammar, just a ton of vocabulary thrown at you. Also a lot of topics are not relevant, esp for travelers or people spending a fair amount of time in a foreign country. For example, a whole section on Kings and Queens, I mean seriously, what use is that to anyone in this day and age? Also a lot re. education and school, most of us are not going to school in Latin America, we need to be able to converse about practical day to day stuff and that is not covered anywhere near enough."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have learned SO much Italian with Duolingo. Now I can finally go to Italy and understand how to speak and what people are telling me. Duolingo might be a viral meme on YouTube or TikTok, but I have actually learned a language from it!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've learned so much with this app, and the day streaks have become goals for me. I go on quests with my friends, and now I (and my friends) feel comfortable enough to speak Spanish everywhere we go. I learn so much! I call it Babble 2.0, because not only is it free, but it's better than Babble, and Babble works! With duolingo, I can effectively learn quickly, and in a fun way! its breaking language barriers for me and my education to come. when my family joined, they agreed with me too! :)"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A great app that will help you to learn first words of your chosen language and help you to start speaking it if you are persistent and follow the playful challenges. And these challenges are really making it feel like you are playing some game, pushing you to learn harder to achieve more, to get to the next level. It is very interesting, not boring at all. Some may complain that there is a lot of repetition, but I found it useful to help me actually to learn the language - to master it at B1 lv"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It used to be good. You used to get good tips and could read the explanations others have on why the right answers were right. You used to get actual feedback. Now it's all gone, either removed entirely or locked behind a paywall. Duolingo, you can't tout that you want to make education free and accessible to all if you're only going to take away the actual educational parts of your app. That's now how this works."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Duo for almost three weeks and find I am thoroughly enjoying it. I find the timed speed tests are not a true measure of my progress due to the questions that require a typed response. There is no need to have us type out those answers. Please consider revisions to this. Other than that, I believe it's worth the price. I find it does freeze often and I have to stop and restart the app. Sometimes even have to restart my phone. I am on the paid version."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Solid in a lot of ways, with a wide variety of languages, but the hearts system effectively breaks this app. Before, the premium gave you extra stuff, but the hearts system is designed to actively stop you from practicing if you don't pay. If you can find your language on another app, use it. The app also helps you improve a little, or practice what you've learned on a better app or actual class, but is certainly not sufficient to give you a major improvement in a language, in my opinion."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"i like how it encourages you to keep going with notifications! and if you're anything like me, you won't do something unless you're told or you just forget, so I really like that! you can also get a great start on any language you want to learn! you can also learn more at once. I'm learning German and Russian! it makes it easy and almost like a game. it's a great app and I recommend it for language learning! -berly any adds-"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"the app has been glitching lately. I will finish a lesson, but it will freeze on the last page where it shows me how many points I earned. it stays frozen until I force exit the app and reopen it. when I reopen, it shows my missing hearts from any mistakes I made in the lesson, but it does not show any points I earned and does not even show that I completed the lesson! super frustrating."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is still a good app for learning, but it is not as good or as fun as before the update. It forces you to learn in a linear path and not be able to bounce around to topics you might want to review. Also, having no lifetime option for a subscription like other language applications is unfortunate, as basically a 2 year subscription could have been a lifetime for something like babbel or Rosetta. I still like the app, and it has helped me learn a lot, but it has lost what made it great."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've genuinely found duolingo helpful in building basic vocabulary and solidifying more complex learnings (things I learn by interacting with natives) later down the road. In other words, duolingo has been like a door-opener and a comfy carpet under my feet as I go along my language learning journey. I've heard other apps are more ""effective"" at teaching, but my belief is that the most effective way is the one that keeps you coming back: good-vibey Duolingo üíñ Keep up the great work, duoteam!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,is very helpful and amazing because it's also remind you to take lessons and it takes your test regularly good platform to learn languages it has almost all languages to learn
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Out of boredom I started the English course, my native language. I was horrified by the quantity of grammar mistakes and app errors in the lessons. It made me immediately regret all the years I've spent learning languages on Duolingo. Needless to say that I definitely can't recommend it anymore. It also has gone woke ‚Äîin case that's important for you."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"duolingo has helped me learn Japanese, German and Chinese! it's a great way for beginners learn from scratch and for people who know more words in a language you can click the other buttonüòÄ"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Reducing my Rating to 1 Star in response to lay offs at Duolingo to replace translator teams with OpenAI. This is a pointless cost cutting maneuver to replace hard working humans with machines that are based on stolen information during the training process. Would recommend AGAINST using this app if you feel strongly about HUMANS getting paid versus AI replacing jobs.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Using the app for Japanese. It feels like a great app for learning things, though some of the language is awkward overly-specific translations of how people use words colloquially. I've not gotten far enough to see if they show how those words are used in other situations, but if somebody doesn't get very far, they might horrendously misuse some words. Overall, though, this is a great tool for learning. It's the first app I've used that gamifies language in a way that's actually motivational."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,the lesson structure can be confusing and unpredictable and the pushing of premium features is a bit tiresome but good overall.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is an amazing app to use when starting to learn a new language it keeps you engage by having a streak and the lessons are fun to do and with super there's way more you can do like what I think is great is practicing the things you failed so you can ace it the next time. So I'd highly recommend this as your very first language learning app because Duolingo also has every language as some only have a few like some only have Spanish French and Italian but Duolingo has all of those and more
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is a comprehensive linguistic tool to get familiar and to get those important habits required to learn a foreign language. I was hesitant at first but by incorporating this app to freshen up my Portuguese, I feel more confident every time. I find the grammar, pronunciation, vocabulary, writing, and oral practices helpful and well paced. You get the knowledge and some fluency depending on the effort you put in it!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"You removed the ability to see what sentences mean when you get them wrong and with the removal of the discussion functionality, no context for the more obscure languages such as Sottic Gaelic. No way to review vocabulary words already learned and am memorizing phrases to pass the test rather than learning how to think in the language. Not good for practical use of the language in conversations without addional resources. It's a game."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I miss the ability to hear the pronunciation on each phrase. There used to be intro lessons for each new subject, but those seem to be gone now, too. Gaming and repetition are great, but if there is no explanation on word placement, then it loses some impact."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Duolingo is an amazing app to learn new languages and it's very good at keeping you on track and having you learn every day. I've installed Duolingo because I've made a goal for myself to learn all 11 official languages in south africa and I'm busy learning Zulu. But I just wish they'd put more work into Zulu. I've learned Dutch on Duolingo to start with an easy language because I already know Afrikaans. But when I compare the two in my learning, Dutch has a lot more work done on it than Zulu."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Enjoyed the experience up until there were no more leagues to get promoted to. Kind of took the fun out of it for me. If the developers could add more leagues that'd be great. But otherwise, great app"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The mascot is very cute and keeps changing when i haven't done the lesson. I quite enjoy using Duolingo to learn Japanese, but I hope that the user still can adjust the difficulty based on their ability or can choose the level of difficulty for the national examination after answering the get started question."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This latest update is awful makes it even more confusing. sometimes it's impossible to understand what the speaker is saying. the enunciation needs work. Typos need to be adjusted, with spell check it gives you wrong answers, something they need to work on. Plus the annoying characters take away from trying to learn. The voices used to learn from are so bad that even google translate can't understand them. Also each lesson dropped from 20 points to 5 points which makes it even harder to enjoy."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Made 3000 XP, work of almost an hour, but just wasn't added to the leaderboard. Sent a bug report, twice, but no response whatsoever and I'm a PAYING Super Duolingo customer..."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have been using this app for about 10 days. I am dyslexic so I have always found reading difficult, and because of that, learning a 2nd language in school was near impossible. Buy with Duolingo. I have learnt more in the short 10 days than I ever leart at school. I have ever recommended it to a friend whose child has used the app to improve their school studies."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"While the app is easy to learn, I found that learning the alphabet, there's no translation for the words I'm learning. How I'm supposed to know what they mean if I can't know their translation? I constantly need to translate into an outside app."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,So far so good. Lots of repetition and a steady slow pace which makes goals achievable. Having fun.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've thoroughly enjoyed being on Duolingo for the last 407 days! I am on the regular Duolingo but it gives me a free three day stint of Super Duolingo from time to time. You can take on as many languages as you would like. I started off with Spanish and Portuguese and now have 9 total languages I dabble with. It's a really fun app that makes me excited to learn. I like the leaderboard and making it feel like a game. I travel to Costa Rica a few times a year and this has helped me get by.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this kind of language learning. It gives me chances to listen, talking and the exercise is repeated over and over! Those exercise can make me memorize many kind of words better. However, there is one of my language is yet to exist which is thai. I understand the difficulties but i do hope to learn it by any means.. It's hard to learn it by myselfü´®ü´® All in all it was the best language learning app ever!!"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Core language learning is pretty good, but higher level lessons obviously e demonstrate neglect and need more maintenance. Everything else is a dumpster fire, trying to upgrade accounts to a family plan is like pulling teeth, and bug reporting functionality is completely broken. Needs a lot of work, and ripe for someone to come along and do it better. Stop trying to make the widget happen. It's not going to happen."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Everything is straight forward.I like to do Duolingo in the night,but this stupid streak thing ends right at 12:00.Three extra freezes arent useful if we cant get more for 100 days.I have tried many times to keep my week perfect as possible but dont have access for hours.If the deadline was at around 5:00-3:00,it would be a lot easier,but it isn't.Keeping track of all our mistakes until we pay to fix them isnt helpful either.Overall terrible learning app and is only fun when you get stuff right."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"What I'm about to say isn't happening for the first time. I completed my lesson for yesterday but today my streak freeze was used to secure yesterday, as though I didn't complete a lesson.

"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Just love the app - bite-size learning of a new language in a fun way, meaning that progressing is completely achievable and you can go at your own pace."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Learning language is so easy in this app and it's also fun learning language in this app. This is the best language learning app in the world. Even if you miss 1 day learning language in Duolingo, he/she will send you notifications to continue your streak. The best language learning app ever"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I betcha that you will find no better app to learn languages than duolingo. It has a game-like design and contains leaderboard, power shop, podcasts, streaks and more to keep the learner couraged and steady towards his/her goal. And, man, the legendary levels are awesome. Lingots are multiplied and turned into gems. You have this app, internet connection, an account and Click, Game on. And the best part? The app is absolutely free of cost, though still there are some optional purchases."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is fun and a great way to learn different language vocabulary. Find someone to practice speaking what you learn, and you can definitely learn a new language."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Edit: it's been 3 year damn. Still can't speak any of my picks but I can say ""I like books"" in Chinese and Spanish now lol. Being unilingual is really inconvenient so here I am. It's a good intro to languages so far. There hasn't been a lot of explanations grammar wise, its mostly memorizing phrases, but I havent gotten too far yet so I'm hoping that changes. I'm glad gaelic is an option too, I havent seen a lot of language apps with it. I'll try it after the Spanish course."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been a long time user of Duolingo, I use to sing its praises - but I can't anymore. Over the past few years every change and addition to the app has limited users ability to communicate and get clarification on things that might not be adequately explained through the lessons. Even in their more popular courses often times this is /needed/ because either duolingo itself gets it wrong - or just doesn't explain it. Since going public, its gone down the drain"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to enjoy this app when i first started it in April 2020 and getting back into my German again but now, it's a complete different story. Always crashing, always freezing, constantly moving stuff about and i can't stand this pathway layout thing that has been done to this. The old layout was way more better when you could pick and choose when you could unlock a few more subjects each time you passed and completed. Change it back to the way it used to be."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoy duolingo because it really helps you with your language/s. also if stuck on a word just press on it and it will help. you get daily rewards like gems üíé and you try to get a high streak. Duolingo is really helpful for school and even when your at home and bored. it really encourages me to go on duolingo and I try my absolute best. After a lesson, it will go over the things that are incorrect and it really helps. Thank you duolingo."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,ads get in the way of learning and the heart system of only allowing you to get a certain amount of activities wrong is detrimental to learning the languages. Needs to do away with the in app purchases that restrict learning if you're not willing to pay. The app prides itself on being educational and free but then hides behind a paywall if you get too many questions wrong.
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very friendly and clearly guided path as you get to learn your language of interest. I highly recommend Duolingo and urge anyone who hasn't tried it to do so. You'll surely enjoy. Keep it up Duolingo üòäüòäüòäüòä
"March 24, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,My biggest issue is the difference between the app on Android and Apple products. I barely get gems for completing the daily tasks and I am constantly getting 15 min boosts in the gold chest. I've always been getting so many boosts that just keep stacking on each other and on iPhone you can save them and use them at later times. I want to have those options too!
"March 24, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This is a fun new way to learn a language. I recommend anybody try the free version even though there are lots of ads. I like that it's not too difficold yet. I seem to be picking it up quickly
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Now the third review I've left in the last year. Every single time I've docked a star - Duolingo has now become the embodiment of platform decay (can't use the other term here). Offline lessons, used to be a premium feature - removed over the last 2 years. Forums, a vital piece of any language learning resource, ESPECIALLY one with Duo's reach? Archived in early 2022, now deleted entirely. There's no reason to use Duolingo anymore, look into the competition."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app... is simply unbelievable. From the animation to the fun learning style (called the Duolingo way) everything is so robust, so complex, yet so simple and effective that I would never want to quit on my streak. Duolingo has offered such a long list of languages to learn and there's so many types of questions to answer, and they all give you that bit of ""YES!"" in-between your lessons. My only complaint is that I learn new words only 1 entire lesson later. I wish I could learn them faster"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love all the different ways Duolingo teaches a language. Also, they do friend quests where you can complete lessons with friends for gems which is nice. I like building perfect streaks as well because they have cool animations for milestones and similar things you reach. In general though, the app design is just very appealing to look at."
"March 24, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I got the free trial and it was a fine app and all, I was learning 2 languages at a time. Once the free trial ended tho it was ads after every lesson even if u backed out of them. Since some exercises used voices the ads would be just as if not way louder (scummy). Also u are only allowed to make 5 mistakes a day before the app doesn't allow u to learn anymore which is dumb. Either allow ads or the limitation, not both! Not worth it unless u subscribe BUT they only let u sub for a year MINIMUM"
"March 24, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Changed my rating from 5* to 1*, because the lastest update is extremely annoying and not as fun as it used to be. The app refuses to open on my pixel phone. One of the characters is a girl wearing hijab and there are many sentences about religion, which is a trauma trigger for religion traumatized people like me, a middle eastern women. I wish there was an option to scape any religion related images or sentences."
