"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is being more and more strict about making a user switch to cloud. It is getting so difficult to manage the storage specially when all the Google photos are also counted under 15GB free space. To download a set of backed up photos on phone, you can only do it one by one. I spent last 2 hours figuring out how to do it, but they have already made life so much harder. Looking for another app to manage photos from now on."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Still a good app, but shows a full screen update message every time you open it (exactly 1 month after updating). Also, if you have cloud backup disabled, it sometimes nags you to enable it, and to skip it, you have to restart the app, as saying ""NO"" to it, it will take a random amount of photos and upload them to your cloud anyways. Can you kindly stop with these intrusive messages? Your app works fine as is. What about an option to select the default screen on startup (for example: Library)?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"First of all: 15GB of free storage is amazing. I can easily backup my entire gallary. Depending on how often you take pictures, it does fill up eventually, but at that point it's only reasonable to start paying for more. I wouldn't recommend using it as your only storage for super important photos/videos, as it definitely isn't immune to viruses and glitches (I've lost huge chunks of data twice in the past 5 years). That is the only reason I don't give this app 5 stars."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Once again the latest ""update"" has made it worse. The wrong location is showing on photos, when I try to rectify it, it doesn't work. This was once a useful tool for photos but yet another update has made it unusable. Why keep trying to fix something which was absolutely fine until you decided to ruin it with utterly useless ""updates!"" I might give it a higher rating if you stop messing with it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Because of the recent update, a bunch of my pictures changed. Some are blurry when they used to not be, some look pixelated, and the new way of storing multiple shots in one stack is so annoying to sift through. I hate how you it's not compatible with any app on my Pixel, and I hate how stupid the storage system is. If I download a photo, it takes ten minutes to find it. I wish they would stop making changes and just let my photos be."

Update 18.3.24: I got a response from Google which had some suggestions, and I do appreciate the quick response (thank you), however, the issue is still a problem - if a create a new album, even though backup is turned off, the photos in the album get backed up to the cloud"

Every time I try to clean my storage, in the storage cleaner, there's only the option to delete, but no option to share. Before deleting any files, I want to share them first, then delete. It's really important. I've been struggling with this problem for a few years already. Every time I find the largest video file, I need to exit and start looking for it in the gallery to share it first."

But there's two things about using it which frustrate me to no end! 1. No 'delete' option for individual pictures/videos, or the entire 'memory'. 2. No 'move' option for the files/memory, if I want to create a folder or move items to an existing folder. These functions would allow me to tidy my files up a little each day; instead, their absence just causes me daily frustration instead!"

I'd rather use the memory on photos than on apps, thanks. // Edit: Yes, I have automatic updates disabled.

Now it's all preset buttons and you can't slide the live editing controls, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?? Uninstall and reset the app to original version, end of story. Updates only make the ads work"

The progress bar gets to varying progressions for each video before saying ""can't download video"" with no error code or further explanation. It wasn't doing this for the first couple days I had the extra Google storage, and lack of device storage definitely isn't the issue."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,When Google got rid of Picasso for your Google photos they traded the best photo and editing program for one that is completely inadequate. They need to bring back Picasso or design an app similar to it. With Picasso it made organizing (and later retrieving your photos) a snap. Also editing and naming your photos was easier. And did I mention the ease of √©diting. Also changing the order of your photos and albums was a breeze. Gone are the days of common sense and customer satisfaction.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Love and hate it. Love the app itself but does not work well with other apps. Hard to share to Instagram and other apps don't recognize that you've sorted them including the physical location. Can be very frustrating Edit for goodle: it's not a downloading issue.

Sometimes I've had to repeat the caption three times before it would stay. How many times do I have to repeat myself about this problem before Google will fix it? 03/13/24 I just added captions to 40 photos of which 16 disappeared. When are you going to fix this Google???

It looks a bit clunky and I find myself tapping where things used to be. It's a bit annoying. Also I'm not a fan of these annoying forced app updates. Nobody wants an app to take up MORE space on their phone! There is NO REASON why I needed or wanted to update this app.

Anyone thinking about ordering from Google photos,can be assured that it's quality photos and it's fairly priced too. ENJOY"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Lots of dupes. I think when I got a new phone it started uploading the same photos like thousands. All same name. Should be a cleanup to remove the dupes without manually having to. Also allow easy transfer from photos videos to upload to YouTube so we can offload some space. It is super difficult to do this now from drive. Like you have to use a computer and download the file local to upload. Terrible experience.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is awful. It keeps auto backing up my photos when it's set to not do that, and it always keeps auto uploading them even though I click don't. Today google alerted me that my plan was at 16gb/15gb because of that just randomly. Earlier today that was sitting closer to 2gb used. When I went to clear out all the photos I DIDNT want auto backed up, it deleted them off my device. So I can't even save photos to my device? Apparently I need to pay to keep photos on my device."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Does most things well, but to not allow you to simply mirror flip an image is asinine. Most selfies are taken backward, so it would be very handy to correct the image. Every other phone I have had included options to flip images vetically or horizontally, and for all the things Google does really well, this is an embarrasing and frustrating omission."

Really frustrating to have ads for a product I pay for constantly presented. Google's response doesn't correspond to any of my issues Redesign is terrible, ads front and center, no way to disable highlights which I don't care about, or the location sucking maps features. Also apparently Google didn't even read the review"

I have a problem that when I'm adding multiple pictures to an album I have to re-sekect then again just to archive. There is not a single ""button"". No option to add photos to a folder and in the same time to archive them. It's primitive and has only very basic options. I'm wondering how productively people can use it to manage their collection of photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Whatever's happened in the most recent update has knackered the ability to add text to images in the editing features. I can get the words on the image but controlling the location and sizing has become a pain. Assuming this is investigated and fixed, it would be nice to see the text autofill the box size fully rather than just on height. Otherwise it's a decent photo storage app and I'm quite happy using it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Mostly good, but I have 2 main issues. Navigation to albums is made more difficult that it needs to be; or should be. Instead of a single press to get to an album menu (navigable from the bottom bar) this app desires that you should navigate to library, and then select on all albums if the album you seek isn't within the first handful of options. Not good. The app also keeps begging me to ""backup my photos to drive"", despite having selected no. Remember my choice, and stop trying to steal data"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really wish there was a way to redownload backed up photos and videos in bulk. There are many gallery-cleaning apps that allow you to go through your camera roll and swipe to delete/keep items, which is something I really need because I'm running out of storage, but they can only access local files and the majority of my images are stored in the cloud instead of my device. Alternatively, if the app had a built-in sorting feature. Except for that, it's great!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is useful, generally, but it does regularly get stuck and doesn't back items up. You will initiate the process and it will just sit there loading in your task bar. This week I restarted my phone 3x and did a full shutdown 2x hoping it would fix the issue. I also cleared the cache. Finally deleted the app and downloading again to hopefully be able to back up my photos and save space on my phone."

App doesn't see this folder when I open 'photos on device'. No clearing cache or restart helps. So I've picked all the photos and selected ' upload to Google photos'. Where are these photos now ???? In the Photos tab, everything is mixed up! Uploaded photos and photos only on my device are shown. And not is the correct order. This app is an embarrassment."

When I go back in and edit the highlight video the sound is fine again, but then after publishing the sound becomes more and more out of sync throughout the video."

One major bug I've encountered that hard-locks the Google photos app, is using the Audio eraser feature on a Video Boosted video.

Response to Google's resonse: I've tried all your suggestions and nothing worked. None of the so-called experts solved any of my issues.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"An okay app but deliberately uses underhanded tactics to push unwanted features. Best example is the backup feature. Turning off automatic backup means receiving reminders to backup regularly. If you decline the backup a second screen pops up repeating the offer; accidentally hitting the wrong button commences the backup with no way to cancel. To undo the action one must log on with a computer and delete items individually (no ""select all"" present). Sketchy practices from a sketchy company."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Really annoying app, first, what dictates a photo being in the ""Photos' section and not the Library? Feels random and I don't feel in control of it. Second, when I turn off backup I did it because I wanted to, why keep asking to turn it on? Then when I say I don't want to back up, it then prompts again to back up manually with a load of images pre-selected, I'm pretty sure I said no?! Nowwhere in settings to stop this. Pretty infuriating."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The best photo app! The fast and accurate search facility is superb and can cope with my many thousands of photos. Editing and enhancement is good too. A better way of managing albums would be useful. I have far too many albums to scroll through and could do with a away of quickly sorting and summarising them. Hard to add a photo to an album when you have hundreds of albums to scroll through. A quick album search at this stage would be handy.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I was really disappointed when I found out tagging is not allowed. This feature is really basic and all other apps have that. We have a lot of images and we need to find them fast. That's what tagging is for. Not a lot of time is spent on making the app. It's just made for money. :( Update: you cannot even email any photos by tapping share. It's getting worse. Update: you can't even copy a photo easily on this app. Very unorganized! Getting worse! It deletes your photos without permission. üò≠
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Buggy and intrusive. If you only want some photos backed up, forget about it. Even with cloud backups disabled, Photos will still crawl through every folder on your phone to find photos, then back them up to the cloud without your permission. There is no way to disable this. For Google Home devices, photo frame capabilities are very problematic. Albums will refuse to update when more photos are added. Newer albums won't even show up as selectable."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is ok, but the search capabilities are very limited, coming from Google. Advanced users should be able to create more capable searches, such as finding pictures taken by camera X or Y, or finding pictures that are in the intersection of 2 albums, or searching the difference between albums, finding pictures that count towards your quota vs not, filter by backup quality... These are a handful of examples that I've needed in the past"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I had initially rated the app 5/5 in 2021 when all I did was view photos quickly. Now even with a premium membership for storage, the features I have access to is very very limited. The edit functionality takes ages to download the video and render it. The inshot Integration is an epic fail. I feel like I'm not using a tested product. I'm a PM myself and these are basics before a release! Please don't make features available only on paid services and not try the user journey yourself once."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"FFS - please just give us an option where we can indicate that photos are being backed up, just not by Google, so this PoS app stops annoying me with pestering me to switch on backups! It's a photo gallery app, not a hotline to upsell me shite that I don't want. p.s. thanks for the bot response that failed to understand the issue entirely."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the organizational aspects and memory reminder function of this app! Most of all, I love that no matter what, with this app, I know anywhere any device I will be able to access my photographs. None of my photos will be missing, out of order or damaged in any way so that I can't open them again. That is key to my peace of mind regarding my personal memories! I am also an award winning international photographer. I take thousands of pictures every year. Storage space matters! I love you!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"No longer syncing, I use to love Google photos now I hate it. For the past few months I've been struggling to get my phone to sync. It' a basic function of the app to automatically upload and store your photos securely in the cloud. It just doesn't happen anymore. I've read everything all over the internet to try get my backup working again eventually it started working when I disabled my face grouping which is really sad because it took me years to set all of that up and now it's gone for good."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Painfully appalling to use. Maybe it's just me, but I don't want to delete a photo off of my phone but I do want to delete that picture off of the storage, yes I turned the sync off. Its just a horrible app to use. Endlessly convoluted and slow. Edit: In typical Google short sighted ness I have been given a link to see how to use the app better, but it is not a click able link. Doh."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Missing simple tools that would really help organizing. If I select a bunch of images to add to an album that I want to then archive, there's no way to either ""select all"" or ""archive"" from within the album. But if I go back to the main photo list where I can select ""archive"", everything I had just selected must now he re-selected, again. This is horribly cumbersome if you're trying to clean up a lot of photos. The app also isn't currently maintaining my device folders. Hoping that's user error."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App suggests - at #1 position for sharing a photo with - someoneI do not know. After some research, I found out that I have exchanged one email with her back in 2013. not a contact, not in my Wi-Fi. CREEPY! Looked her up and we both may be living in the same city. As such, it's conceivable that she is close by, but that and the fact we exchanged one email 11 years ago, is not enough. Apps built in feedback tool cannot be accessed from relevant view. official support emai listed is dead."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Absolute garbage, takes forever to load photos doesn't properly display folders, doesn't allow for a streamline view, instead you have to scroll forever because some garbage feature that clusters by date which you cannot seem to change in settings. I cannot believe this is the default gallery for this damn phone. Absolutely horrendous app, constantly prompting you to pay for more storage when what it offers at a baseline is God awful. Would not recommend, would never recommend."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app gives me the tools relive those memories. As if it just happen yesterday. My suggestion is to gather all the picture you wish to put together. So,You don't have to scroll around trim snd delete. You can always strimlined this manually. The app will sort your pictures automatically strickly use as for preview. You can always trim,replace and add your pictures as your personal preference when create it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app sucks. I hate it. Theoretically you can see all the pictures on your device but, in practicality it mixes them up in a bunch of folders so you can't find them, why not at least have 1 option t just look at all the pictures. No, it wants to sort it all poorly without telling me, and today, it doesn't let me even look at pictures, only select them for sharing, I just want to see the text on a photo I took, not send it to my mother in law."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have Google One subscription. When I open my photo from the Google photo and choose magic eraser, it will give a loading page for about 3 seconds, and then the app is closed. This is disappointing, as the core feature that I want to try after purchasing the Google One subscription is the magic eraser feature from the Google Photo. Please fix it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Can't believe you guys got rid of one of the most useful features of the app - the map. It was super easy to find a photo if you knew where it was taken, by looking at the map and picking it out from the location. Not surprising though, Google always kills off the most useful features. It's like you get pleasure from it. You guys were cool when you had the ""Don't Be Evil"" motto."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Getting really tired of my photos backing up and deleting from my device despite me telling it not to. Half tempted to delete the app. If I wanted it to delete my photos, I would have turned that setting on! When they delete, none of my apps can get the photos unless they have Photo integration, so I have to go back, download again and then upload my photo on the other app. It's infuriating. I can't even get an answer on how to stop it from Google support!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've used Photos forever. This last update added in something affecting sharing and now I'm getting bombarded with spam/phishing invites. I'm getting multiple notifications a day from complete strangers trying to get people to download something they've shared. And there's no option to turn this off. Edit: let me just report the numerous requests I get a day from throwaway/bot-generated emails, that will fix it, surely"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Edit 3: photos don't sync across phones even if I pay monthly (to access a BLUR FUNCTION which is behind paywall). Edit 2: impossible to move pictures from a phone folder to a SD folder. Guess you gotta pay for that storage if you wanna make sure to keep your pictures! Edit: they force this in your phone, you have to deactivate automatic sync cos it's on by default, and now you gotta pay for extra storage. Worked fine until this update. Now it's super slow and doesn't let me erase pictures."

No, this trash app put them in a folder and not the main album. The memories tab is also useless and shouldn't be forced. I don't care about several random Facebook photos from five years ago being spotlit for no reason other than the date. Also, transparent PNGs end up in a weird black box instead of transparent. Don't respond."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Why does creating copies of photos set their time and date to the current time and date instead of their original time and date? Pretty nonsensical behavior that messes up your gallery. Also, too many photo adjustments force you to ""create copies"" instead of saving over the original photo. As soon as you use certain sliders, your ability to save goes away and you have to create copies. The web version doesn't do this, so it's a problem with the app version."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is one of the best apps for photos. Live album is too good. It recognizes photos from the camera store and organises in the album without an error. I have my kids album and anytime i click a new photo it is able to to select her pic and add to album. Update : One more feature should be added. It should segregate photos which are not part of any album. It will be easier to clear clutter.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is probably the worst thing to happen to androids since the standard gallery app stopped coming predownloaded onto the phone. With the standard gallery app, every photo you take and download are put into the same place for you to go down the list, the date it was downloaded. With this app, there is absolutely NO telling where a photo will go once downloaded. There are so many organization issues, I can never find anything, and have even lost an entire ""album"" üôÑ of photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like it; sharing is good. BUT I wish Google allowed more storage. You can fill 15GB pretty fast. I also wish Photos didn't keep trying to ""back up"" EVERYTHING from my phone! I want photos on my phone's SD card kept separate from the few I manually upload to Photos. Worse, if you use Photos to delete a photo on the phone, it doesn't go into (restorable) phone trash but a weird Photos deleted folder. And DON'T hit the ""eject SD card"" button in Photos! Just use a homescreen shortcut not the app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Backed up photos disappeared all of sudden today. All of my backup photos from earlier was deleted. Older photos not found and they are not in bin or archived. It's like those photos disappeared. Very disappointed as I have been using Google Photos from a long time and there is not proper support to contact the team and get this issue resolved. Many memories and photos suddenly disappeared it's no use to keep using this app.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very limited functionality, no ways to copy/delete photos in bulks, no ways to filter or sort photos properly (can't even filter pictures not associated to any album). UI is very minimalistic and unclear without any real control over your storage, with some functions not working at all. All this vagueness is to push you into upgrade your plan. Very disappointing app from Google."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Updates make experience continuously worse. Live photos don't function properly and can no longer be shared or saved as videos even if uploaded correctly. Detection faulty and still cant search based on where the photo was uploaded from so devices and folder all become jumbled. Also belives screenshots are taken by the camera so if automatic backup is turned on all screenshots are uploaded.

Then the latest update broke the fuctionality of some basic tools. - text tool is now unusable and freezes text in place refusing to move, rotate or resize. - mark up / pen no longer functions. Occasionally i can get it to do some pen strokes but it draws straight lines on its own wherever it so chooses it seems Bad update. Please make older versions openly accesible."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app had the potential to be the best photo and photo storage app on the market but as per usual Google built a minimally viable product and then gave up. Gripes? You can't search albums when adding photos to them, making this app useless for anyone with 50 or more albums. Which is anyone that's had a phone for 5 years or more. So basically everyone. There are numerous other features missing like embedded albums for organization (folder structure), private cloud folders, etc."

I have tried every troubleshoot the internet provides without a fix. I contacted Google - they don't monitor that email. I posted in the ""community."" No response.

I couldn't delete or edit any photos and had to uninstall the app for it to function. This app is made by the same company that makes both the OS and the phone itself.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,A labyrinth. What is the point of having this app and the Google Gallery app? They are so siloed it's an incredibly frustrating experience trying to simply locate a photo you've edited in Gallery to print in Photos. Want to download all the photos in an album? Well apparently that's too much to ask. You have to download them individually. It's a mess.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is the best way for me and my partner and my family to keep our photos together, given there are so many, and also allow us to show each other what we've been up to. The editing features are self-explanatory and fun to use, without being too advanced - although I'm sure they could be advanced but I'm not fully aware of how to use that particular part of it. I love this app because it allows me to look at photos across devices, it's simple to use and really just the perfect photo app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Can't stop the backup of screenshots, which is extremely annoying. No longer shows as a deselectable folder in the Backup folders menu.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,love the app but it's extremely annoying that I am now getting spam messages in photos app...yall need to get that locked down...it's an app for photos not spam. there should be settings where we csn turn sharing all the way off so we don't have to receive random messages like that. I have everything turned off and I still get them. I don't like the sharing feature at all.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I used to be able to take a picture and draw lines on the picture using the markup editor tool. I'd use this for marking off item on my grocery list and it worked good even when the phone went into sleep mode. Recently I believe you made changes with an update and the markup feature now doesn't work the same. When I'm using it and the phone goes into sleep mode the app loses the edits and/or has problems and makes the function non useable.

And if that troubleshooting step was not 100% guaranteed to work, the level of pissed off I would be is immeasurable. Fix this app!!"

Previously RAW went to a separate folder, you could choose not to back it up and easily delete them whilst keeping the jpg. The newest dumps them in the usual folder, no ability to stop them backing up but worst of all, no ability to bulk delete RAW whilst keeping the connected JPG -you need to go through each photo in turn and do it manually.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Can't download multiple photos when you can do the same functionality in laptop. Basically defeats the purpose of backing up in Google if you can't download into your phone when needed. They expect us to go into each photo/video and then download. Instead of selecting and downloading just like in browser. A big miss by the product team. Specially when considering the Google native phones use this as their default app for photos.

I can't hear Korean, and it's really annoying."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Pictures are separated by month, day, and yearr. Making them easier to find when showing or sending them to friends. Books, collections, videos and other content can be placed in super easy yo use folders. So you don't have to scroll through all of your pics to locate the one you want."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If you create an album, it's completely invisible to your actual phone system. You can't upload things from these ""albums"" into other apps. Also, they will just completely disappear. Oh, you spent a few hours compiling thousands of photos into an album? Too bad, Google Photos just completely removed the entire album!!! Actual garbage. Let me choose if I want the album to be a PHYSICAL PHONE STORAGE album or a completely inaccessible figment of an ""album""."

They are not in bin or archived. It's like those photos disappeared. Very disappointed as there is not proper support to contact the team and get this issue resolved. Many years of memories got lost and it's no use to keep using this.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Still Not worth 1 star in latest update everything has ground to a snails pace cleared cache etc using Android 14 sharing in conversations impossible now even from WiFi fix needed asap Click on an existing conversation to add a new photo used to take a second in can now take 3 hours to load the existing conversation. Happened day after update. Same with scrolling through pics. Everything up to date on Android 14 plenty of memory. Tried eventually app started a 24 hour re back up there is a bug
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Needs more editing options but I love having an app that stores all my pictures and reminds me or suggests what I should do with them when space is getting low. And for the family plan the storage is fantastic. I can recover a lot of images and memories if I ever need to and I'm pretty satisfied with how Google photos works.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great features, fluid UX, and tons of editing aspects make this one of the most well rounded photo gallery apps on the planet. Add in a Google one subscription and you've got access to even more features. Really good job Google üëç My only gripe is with the video features, most people may not upload movies but I use my Google photos gallery to hold my digital library of films. I'd love the option to add closed captions or change the language as long as the file is present. Great app otherwise."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Can't stop upload. Tried forcing stop and disabling the app. No good. Demands the upload (the computer I no longer have) be completed. No help online. None of the suggestions worked. When this app was working, it wasn't all that good either. You're always in the dark as to weather the photos are backed up to Google drive. They may be backed up in a hidden folder. I have the backup switched off but it still back up to the Google drive. You'll find out when you run out of space and need to log."

It solved the issue, but now, as it resyncs all my data, it has duplicated EVERY SINGLE photo and video attached to my account. This issue is exclusive to the mobile version of the program, somehow?? My desktop version does not show this issue thankfully, but this shouldn't even be a problem in the 1st place... duplicating everything smh..."

I had TCL phone prior and it was no problem, I had Samsung before it was no problem...... now I'm using pixel 8 so much Artificial Intelligence involed just to keep my photos within my phones own storage, I waste so much time just checking my photos and videos.. it's unreal! So much glitches. Now I'm having a buyer's remorse."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,There was a pop up on sync in gallery which I accidentally permitted. Now all the photos that were on Google photos are on my one plus device as well. This is annoying as all the photos that are deleted from gallery are automatically getting deleted from Google photos even after back up (back up is automatically done). Trying to figure out a way so that my gallery is not loaded and my photos are safe in Google photos.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Utterly terrible, as is usual for a Google app. Terrible layout, terrible interface, appalling lack of customisation, no sorting options, albums not easily accessible, separate and unrelated albums merged together, tile sizes not adjustable, button navigation unintuitive, constantly pushing subscriptions to this and that feature. An absolutely awful app that fails miserably at its most basic mission."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like being able to use this app to view all my photos across my device, and selectively backup my photos and share photos to friends, family, and the public. I don't like how the app keeps asking me if I want to backup all my photos from my device. When I say I don't want to (because I only want to backup my decent camera photos, not everything else), the app pulls me away from the main page to ask if I want to backup select photos ‚Äî something that I'm already doing. -2 stars for this."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Well, deleting this app now as I am starting to receive mass spam and phishing messages in my Google photos app, just like what's happened in Drive and many other Google apps. Google needs to really up their security with these or we need a better OS for Android devices, security has become really weak with Google apps and services over the past 3 years, which is why I've been obsoleting their apps as more vulnerabilities come into play....maybe stop messing with AI and fix your platforms."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Truly an amazing app. I've been enjoying different features on it since I got to know about it. The most interesting part is that the app is free, yet, with great features. It also enables one to maintain privacy, keeps memory and saves space on your phone. Even if you lose access to your devices, the backup feature got you covered."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Shared Photos and Backup not working like before. One photo was stuck on getting ready to back up, rebooting and different network connections did not resolve the issue so I just deleted the picture. Shared photos with my partner are set to autosave but they don't save automatically. If I do save them manually, it will appear for a few seconds then disappear."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Google search is fantastic. Google photos not so much. It is very tedious to organize as it doesn't have a simple alphabetic option to sort albums. AI doesn't recognize people very well either especially over time, such as kids. Basic search functionality is missing. Quite disappointing actually."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app brings good memories at the right time (When it asks you, if you remember a photo) things that I've forgot about-especially dates of images just brings light to me-just like a few moments ago and prior to today. It also makes nice collages and plays music in the background (that sometimes I don't want to hear-if around others or if I cant handle the noise).. overall, it's a good app üëç"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Once you run out of storage, it is an absolute nightmare to clean. All my galleries are linked together for no reason. I can't get my personal gallery out of my school account, I can't delete photos from Google without them getting deleted from my phone's gallery, and there's basically no settings to change any of this."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The backup though. I need to be online just to watch and look at my videos and photos. It really hurts. Fix it. Not because it just save in the cloud that doesn't mean it won't be there in your device. It will be good if it will just backup but also not remove it from the device just like files saving in google drive, the file just save in the clouds or drive and then notting happens in the file I mean it doesn't get remove from the device and can open it just in that device."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app doesn't make ""copies"" when downloading different things, you can be downloading a kitten picture and because it's file is the same label as the puppy picture it deleted the old ones even though their seperate aside from that. Instead of getting rid of a photo with the same label to use the new one, it should register as a double or just not be deleted in general. I've found this app useful but when I discovered this massive problem, I felt like photos failed to do it's job; Storage."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good tools and edit options (as an amateur!) but misses 2 key features for me: (1) ability to select which albums are backed up (rather than all or none) and (2) action options by album, e.g. delete all photos in album from device, download all photos in an album to device - currently these have to be done one at a time, such a waste of time."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Very good until your storage runs out, it will push anything into getting you to upload photos and upgrading your plan. I stopped using this and switched to photosync backing up locally to PC or Mac. Never delete your local photos once it's in Google photo cloud, you will have trouble backing them up somewhere else later. if you're on Google paid plans then this app is excellent."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This was a functional app until it stopped showing photos that weren't backed up. I store a lot of random phone wallpapers on an sd card; I don't care if I lose those, but I do want to be able to see them to pick a wallpaper. Removing that utility makes the app superfluous. I'm deleting it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why is are all downloads excruciatingly slow? 5G and wifi are the same results. Also why does it keep making my phone get crazy hot? Also a backed up photos only filter would very nice. App keeps downloading photos back into the cloud even after I already deleted them and turned off backup, why is this? Finally why can't I delete JUST the photos in the backup? I have to go through hoops to keep it from trying to delete off the phone storage."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Missing Shared Partners!! Please return that option! The entire top row is missing from view and I used to be able to go into my partners shared photos and they used to download automatically to my side. Update: I know how to setup up sharing since I originally had it active. My post was about the fact the option bar at the top was missing! It has now since returned and I can see my partners photos.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"So, i use this app the most when looking at my photos and downloaded stuff. But I'm very frustrated because I went and did the 'free up storage' thing for the Google cloud, but it deleted stuff of my phone completely without review. No where on the pop-up screen did it say things would be straight up gone. My entire gallery is gone on my phone with like less than 10 pictures remaining. I'm still gonna use this app, but if I'm cleaning it up, I'm doing it manually."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I bought the Pixel 8 pro for features like video boost. I'm extremely disappointed to find that a 2 minute video takes several HOURS to upload, a couple more hours to become available and after all of that waiting, I can't share these enhanced videos. What an utterly pointless feature and waste of time."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Another example of scummy google software design. Photos are automatically synchronized across all devices. Disabling backup does not prevent synchronizing and will download all photo stored previous stored on google account on new device. Deleting photos on Google account will result in photos being deleted on all devices. I assume it's a design to encourage buying storage space from Google.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Backed up photos disappeared all of sudden today. All of my backup photos from earlier was deleted. Older photos not found and they are not in bin or archived. It's like those photos disappeared. Very disappointed as I have been using Google Photos from a long time and there is not proper support to contact the team and get this issue resolved. Many memories and photos suddenly disappeared it's no use to keep using this app
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Asks to back up your photos. Fills up Google Drive. Asks you to pay for more space or delete the backed up photos. If not, you cannot recieve Gmail or edit Google Docs since they use Google Drive space and it just got filled. When you delete the backups, it deletes the photos from your phone too. If you only deleted old photos, or big photos like it suggests, then you probably wont notice they were deleted. You better have backups. I know multiple people who lost their photos from this."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This app is OK but could be so much better. Feature requests: - RAW photo editing a la Lightroom for when I upload photos from my mirrorless camera (or DSLR for some people) to my phone over Wi-Fi - Combining photos into a collage - Finer control of image adjustments - More sophisticated text controls like fill and stroke (making memes?)
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I want the geniuses at Google to know that this app is the greatest thing since sliced bread. It's the perfect way to back up my life memories, and the ""suggest to archive"" feature is good at figuring out which photos might be unwanted. I wish there was an option to delete duplicates or similars, though. How is there no way to mirror a photo?!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Best described this application is a safe way to use photos and store on your typical device or computer with a free 15gb of storage for your personal use and if you need more you have options to buy this at the convenience of your own budget. There are great systems in this world and it's always great to take a picture and not to worry about the things depleting your character so I think the Google photos application has great potential for its user interface with all of its own tools.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Stopped backing up with 80gbs free, that I pay for to have extra every month.. they are pushing the 2t on me when they won't even let me use the 80gbs I already pay for.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's nice that you can scroll to a specific date. Minus one for nagging me to update every week or so. Annoying.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Im sorry if im beginning to sound like a broken record, but i have to say the same about this half baked app. If only Google could finish the job just once... This app falls way short in almost every arena.. Sharing works, but the controls are weak... if you like sharing, youll be happy because with G Photos, it's a challenge to prevent a share. They did a good job with the share to/from G Photos. That function is simple and without problems. Again, security is almost non-existent."

Worst gallery, waste of time and money"

This is rediculous please stop such things.

But BEWARE, deleting pics from GP ALSO deletes them from your phone (how does that even work?!), so I recommend storing elsewhere first. Insidious app imo."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Edit: the response shows that the dev team doesn't even understand the concept of file management - the problem is that the file structure I back up is not maintained in Google photos! They just go to one giant unorganized space. The file management in Google photos is atrocious. I.e there is none! It makes literally no sense that my photos are in folders on my phone and then they just go to one big messy blob when they're loaded to Photos. Makes it impossible to find anything

I don't want to give access to all the photos on my device, but the app doesn't work otherwise. I don't want to backup, yet get many pop-ups to do so. And if you do (e.g. by accident), then you run out of storage and are asked to pay for it. Then there's no way to undo the backup, you have to delete photos one by one, making sure they aren't part of your albums. You'd think a Google engineer could calculate space required in advance."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Edit and update: previously I said that my photos were lossed and taken by this app. Which is partly true. I found I can access my photos only on this app now. I use Google gallery most of the time because of my this taste for this app. Now my photos have been removed and now I don't have much of a choice.

Photos on Chromecast don't so all info on ambient mode (yes i make sure all the location and date data has transferred to photos) spoke to a patronising person on the chat function about this.... Its something Google did in a November update not something I did. Just tried the new highlight function that's been touted as a new feature in android.... Doesn't work. Just sends you back to the utility screen. Why can you just sort it. Transfer to apple
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"How does such a big company like this make something so messy and skewed!? What are the Product Managers thinking?? It's confusing in so many ways. First it should be clear when you delete photos, you're deleting them only on the cloud but keeping them on local storage, or the deleting from local storage but keeping in the cloud, or deleting universally.. This is just one of the many annoying things. You cannot sort photos according to their size, or at least I found it confusing to do."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Annoying overlay every time you open the app to upgrade to the newest version of the app. Updates aren't small, but are frequent and have no noticeable improvements on the end user side. Can't remove location from a photo (your help page instructions do not work) tagged by camera. Can't do things like delete all photos in an album, or rotate multiple photos (rotating even 1 reuqires a ton of clicks)"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Photos has a button to free up space. Really should revamp this awful button. If you don't know, freeing up button literally takes every photo off and out of any folder. Also, I am unable to find photos by face recognition.

I can send to print shop whatever I want or print myself on my equipment."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is absolutely terrible on the Google Pixel. Not only is it impossible to find photos, but the way it saves them also makes it impossible to use this app in any cohesive way. The way albums are created and photos are downloaded is so non-intuitive it will make you insane. Going back to Apple because of this and this alone. Sad."

If a shared picture was downloaded i have to go to camera roll and keep scrolling until i find it to be able to copy or move to another folder. 3. Does not provide a full functionality on my google phone. I had to download google galary to do certain things like create a new folder and easily navigate between them. 4. Shared pictures don't show geo info, it should be optional"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Dislike this app! I don't want Google managing my photos, spying into my private life. It rearranged photos which were managed just fine before. App wants to create albums, tag, ""share"". I don't want any of that! Lost access to my SD card. Phone wants to format it, i.e. erase. I'm taking back control of MY photos. New phone, new SD card, transfer all pics to safe storage, then restore old phone to factory settings! Google is like a clingy girl/boyfriend that won't go away! Microsoft too!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It is a very confusing service. I want to pick out some photos for a collage for my class and half the time the ability to scroll quits. There are so many look at this day folders in the way. And I have no way of separating photos based on what they are about. It would be nice to have a folder for work and one for vacation but no it's all or nothing. I have been trying to find photos for two days and downloading them to the computer is also hit or miss as sometimes they don't download.

So after all that work combing through hundreds of pics and figuring out dates and names, I have nothing to show for it. Yes, I still have the photos but now I have no way of getting those names and dates again. Thanks, Google."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Just updated, honestly I think photos are updated far too often. My biggest issue with Google photos is that I can't share my favorite pictures directly to my Facebook page. I have to send them to my Gallery first to download the photos and then I can upload them to share. Seriously I only use this app to save my photos and organize them when I have the time. Takes up a lot of space for what it allows users to use it for."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If i could rate it lower i would. Most anger enducing app ever created by man. It syncs your photos from your device onto your google account, including the deleted ones to use as much space as possible and then it demands that you pay or you won't be able to use your gmail. It offers to ""free up space"" and when you click yes it irreversibly deletes all your DEVICE STORED PHOTOS AND VIDEOS instead of the google ones. A cherry on top is the fact that they don't have a download all option."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I don't mind that it stores my photos. I do mind that it wants to backup my photos all the time and then when I run out of space it wants me to buy more space. Then when I empty my phone, it is not emptying my Google cloud photos. Photos. Either not user friendly or just complicated. I want my photos and I don't want to worry about how I'm going to get them back. And I certainly don't want the app wanting to charge me for something else. Google, you make enough money."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Google Photos is a commendable app, offering seamless photo management and storage. Its user-friendly interface and automatic backup make it a reliable choice. However, enhancing privacy features would be beneficial. The ability to move entire albums to the locked folder, rather than individual images, would significantly improve organization and user control over sensitive content."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Backup settings ignored and pics uploaded without permission. Pics then analyzed and used. Forcing deletion only moves pics inti bin and if that is deleted to the pics remain within the cloud. Poor security and lack of data privacy fundamentals. While the app is free it only consists of basic features and cumbersome UX despite regular ""storage"" updates. Now I know what the intensions are. Pixel phone offer quality and genuine android features? Apparently not. Never again."

Doesnt even have a flip image option with the paid version . I despise that instead of displaying the dates or saying ""on this day last year"" it now just gives vague descriptions of seemingly random unrelated pictures. . Why did anyone feel it was necessary to do this when it was perfect exactly how it was ?! Revert back to an older version and fire the team working on this"

"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Just, nah. Limited vocabulary here. So. Nah. It could be a bit less invasive. It is very limited. Storage needs updating. I'm an editor, and I need storage without breaking the bank, to pay you what you clearly deserve, but can't afford, therefore I don't have storage, and I can't afford to subscribe to higher bytes. Therefore my photos are in the clouds and out of my reach for impromptu edits to upload. Mouth full. I'm going back to bed."

However despite leaving phone on charge and with WiFi on, it still only backuped a few photos and stopped. I think it may be screen lock or other issue causing it to stop. I am sure how to fix.

But this app is not at all consistent. Hence why I'm using another gallery app from google that acts much better. It becomes frustrating whenever I delete an photo from google photos it gets off my device, but when I delete a photo from my gallery that's more prone to not being removed from both platforms and only one. It's not consistent, especially when coming back."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,No control over what is backed up There is no option to select only certain folders. Google keeps sucking up every stupid screenshot and whatsup meme. It's become useless. It also keeps turning on original size for uploading instead of reduced size. I'm currently paying for extra storage. I will be taking my files offline and cancelling as this service is not working.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Backup with google photos was the worst decision I have ever made in my life. Pictures that were placed into albums are no longer in their respective albums. A single photo takes 5 minutes to download within the app and gallery outside of google photos is disorganized as well without a change even being made.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Update is worse than before. Everything that didn't work before still doesn't work, plus it's more difficult to see and edit texts with pictures. If I have to read two obscure articles to get the thing to work then it's clearly not intuitive."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Doesn't make it clear that when you remove images, you also remove them from your phone.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I just had to come here to give my review. I HATE Google photos. I just needed it to back up a few of my photos but they have made such a bad trap to not let anyone escape from this. Now I wanted to get rid of the Google photos but it doesn't let me download multiple photos on my device directly or delete them on Google photos directly without affcting my device. They have deliberately made this part complicated so that no one can escape their trap for paying them money. I have wasted my time so
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"A google backup feature that I don't use is pestering me to pay for storage that I don't need and seemingly can't be dismissed.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have turned on the camera folder in the backup folders in Google Photos, but the screenshots taken in Google Photos are also shown in the camera folder only, meaning the screenshots are shown in the camera folder only and get backed up, whereas I don't want to backup them. So whatever screenshot I take in my device, it should be visible separately not in camera folder, it should have a separate folder and have an option to turn on or off the backup of separately screenshots."

I think I'm not sure because I can't find my photos anymore! Fix this garbage man!! How is it possible I lost pictures I was looking at and it only kept 3 from that time period?
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Combining raw files with jpeg is ridiculous. Having a separate folder was so much better. I could backup what I wanted without using all my storage space. I will have to find an alternative to Google photos.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,THEY HIJACK YOUR PHOTOS! DO NOT USE! THEY HOLD YOUR PHOTOS HOSTAGE! There is no native way to download the full resolution photos from this software other than Google Takeout. That system is HORRENDOUS and doesn't allow for any sort of splitting of your portfolio of photos - it's all or none. It's impossible to tell if you got them all AND it separates the Metadata from the files. They're doing that to force you to keep increasing your data storage subscription because you can't back them up!
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My big problem is that upload to Google photos is on by default. I was barely able to have room for emails, and when I turned auto upload off, then tried to delete the photos that would not fit on Google photos because it's less than 10gb if you use gmail, it also deleted them from my phone! No solution yet but I feel like I can't take pictures anymore even if my phone has 500GB of space because Google photos has a teeny tiny amount of it. Honestly, if upload was off by default, it would be fine"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app.But there are some problems. When you delete some pictures, they go to the trash right? Even if I delete the pictures in the trash, they say it's backed up and won't delete from the trash and my memory of my account is very low from this problem. But not bad. Keep up the good work developers. Not saying that it is too bad. I hope I didn't hurt anyone's thoughts. And I have a small request can you increase the GB space? I need it a lot.Those who are reading this review, it's good.Thanks."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This is a really good app to store your pictures in the cloud as well as edit but the editing features need updating majorly. I want the same features that I see in these apps of just pictures editing because the limited capacity for filters and blemish markups etc R none unless you pay for them and they still really suck please update your picture editing services thank you.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,for the most part I love this app but it seems to be getting worse about notifications every update. I never know if my shared photos have been seen or the likes and comments don't show up until days later and it's becoming quite frustrating. I have done all the troubleshooting and uninstalled and reinstalled countless times please fix

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"UI workflow for basic operations have become more convoluted and annoying to use over time. Myopic focus on continually chasing ""improvements"" to the interface while they fail to realize that the app is no longer competent at its basic functionality as a photo gallery.

Didn't change or did anything since and it just resolved."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Your Google Photos App is slow, Google Album does not add pictures until after 12 tries adding 1 to 2 pictures at a time, after adding pictures and then choosing Options, the App deletes all pictures and the entire Album, so you have to start all over again. Then after the Google Photo Album is completed, it is almost impossible to add any more pictures and it takes up to 11 attempts to add by adding 1 to 2 pictures tures at a time. Your many people need to fix, test, and maintain this App."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Accidentally freeded up space on my phone because of the garbage ""Free up space"" button that I though would free up space on the Google Photos. Now all my photos completely erased from my phone, and there're also some photos that I like even it has a bad quality or blurry. Probably leave -5 star if I'm able to and then throw this app to the trash can if I don't have photos there. Rather lost my memory or phone than backing up my new photos or videos to the app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very unhappy with a recent change they made. They used to allow you to sort your photos by the people in them using facial recognition. Now they've changed their policy so that you have to let them collect you and your family/friends facial data from your photos if you want to keep this feature turned on. Very dispicable tactics, they want to force people to relinquish their privacy. Disgusting."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Cannot export Google photo is fine to use until you want to export photos to your hard drive. There is no easy way to take out your photos, not to mention by albums from Google photo. The Google account takeout way is hard to use, and broken especially when you have large volumes. It's impractical. Do not use Google photo as your sole storage. At least don't put your photos to it's cloud and delete your local copies."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I question the honesty of Google. It doesn't matter how much data you delete, it says I'm out of space, pay now for extra storage. I smell scam. Going forward, Google Photos will have to be a very temporary holding place until they can be downloaded to an external drive. I have already turned off media backup. Extortion seems to be a method of making money for Google. Pay up, or no more email. 2/14/23 update. Deleted and cleared data not recognized as gone. The extortion attempts continue."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's been buggy for months. I just did the update and now every time I try to open a folder with files so I can work with them all it does is try to load and load and load and load and load and load and load and load but the song never ever load. Minutes is garbage so I can enter the photo and I just gave up. I can't do anything with it. Every single product you have just keeps getting worse and worse.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google Photos is the best photo app on the planet and I really enjoy making special effects pictures and videos. My ONLY argument with this app is when it plainly states on the app settings on the option (Clean junk for more storage) and that when you clean junk photos that the photos you choose to keep will remain in your (Google Photos Folder) But once I completed the cleaning process, every photo I chose were deleted and along with my favorite photos and that's the second time it's happened."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Google Photos is a great app, and I have been using this for years but now I have encountered some limitations that I hope Google can address: 1. Create albums within albums for more granular organization. For example, I could have an album for ""Travel"" and then create sub-albums for each trip I have taken. 2. Back up albums as they are in my Gallery (exactly with the same name) for easier photo management and navigation. I hope Google Photos considers these feedback items."

So when I edit and if I don't want the original, I have to go in to delete those manually. Wish there was an option to choose what I want to happen to the original every time I edit"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I have given 2 stars because of a reason 1. The photos app has a Potrait blur feature which produces a background blur after taking a photo but the blur does not give a bokeh effect around background lights when the photo was taken normally but when the photo is taken in potrait mode the bokeh effect appears around the lights. 2. The subject selection is not good sometimes it would have been better if there was some way to manually correct the subject selection by hand.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been trying to delete photos to make space but because I have a larger amount, I basically have to delete everything one at a time, which not only time consuming and tedious but also of course just like apple Google wants to charge for storage now.

Account is very much the same haven't changed and those photos are forever missing from birthday to other events"

Everytime I open camera and open the storage it automatically resets to backing up online even though I've turned it off.

Switching to iPhone?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Nice app to edit, manage, backup/store photos. Following two features should be added: 1. Rename photos and videos, mostly in backed up files which no longer exist in local device 2. While adding photos in a online folder/album in Library, local folders shall be displayed to fetch the photos easily. Not all local photos are available to add in an album."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,So many errors and lost photos. Sharing albums is a nightmare and I can't find a way to fix it without more errors. I try to delete photos now to make room since there is a 15 GB limit and I go back and they are NOT deleted!! Is this some kind of scam to get people to pay for the storage? I will be switching phones from the Google Pixel to something else more reliable. Terrible experience with everything.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,One way storage is fine until I can't clear it because I can't back anything up. I guess I just have to make sure the original devices still have a copy before I delete this app? Because it has no features once storage is full and I can't clear storage without a bulk download feature many might consider a necessity for an app like this. Edit: it deleted half of my photos when I disabled backup and sync before clearing space. Pointless to have the option if the app just deletes things anyway.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I mean it's OK. It's not the best app for ur photos and the 100gb trial is annoying why can't I just buy 100gb instead of paying monthly. Also I take no photos or videos for a day the next day it says I'm backed up...it's doing that so I can buy storage ..
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Settings constantly change locations and my setting are reset without permission. The result is lost photos videos deleted by this app on my phone because sync and such were reinabled without permissions.

Otherwise, this is a solid app that facilities editing for not-so-novices like me.

Those are photos I will NEVER get back. I was able to save a few by buying more space and looking in the trash bin, but it is still such a shame."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's difficult to control to stop backing up. The worst is you can't edit the photo and save over or have an option to save over/save a copy. You can ONLY save a copy which just takes more time and effort to go back to remove previous versions. I've never encountered this before. I will start using another app.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So I accidentally clicked the back up button because the pop is very intrusive and cannot be cancelled and ended up using the entire space. I then proceeded to delete the photos from the drive but, this would also delete the photos from my phone and nothing can be done about it.

Raw Photos used to be in their own folder. This made exporting them to a PC for editing easier.

I have noticed that with phone updates ALL THOSE ORIGINAL FEATURES ARE NOW REMOVED! For this reason I'm extremely dissatisfied with the GOOGLE PHOTOS app. I feel like GOOGLE has duped all early purchasers knowing those features were to be removed soon after purchase. I could go on.. like the lack of cases for the phones.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There are several issues I've experienced thus far: 1) The screenshot pop-up does not allow you to choose to delete directly after its taken - in the event it was taken by mistake. The only option is to ""edit"" it - you have to manually go back into your gallery to delete it. 2) The video functionality is very basic. You can't choose to change the video speed, for example - which is fairly standard across other similar apps. 3) Inability to take an image frame capture from a video."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Most pathetic app google has introduced. Let me tell why I said this. 1. Deleting photos make the original file get deleted from the mobile. So every Ineed to delete some files I had to login to web browser or another device. And then delete it. 2. Once you save a file to cloud (in any quality) you cant change it later. Due to that most of the people have less storage in their gdrive. 3. No option to exclude video from auto backup. I think Google is deliberately doing this to sell their plans

"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's bewildering that Google Photos unlocks features based on the device you use, not the subscription you hold. Having a subscription should grant full features access regardless of the device. It's disappointing to see limitations imposed this way, undermining the value of a paid subscription. Google should reconsider this approach to ensure subscribers receive the full set of features, across all devices."

This is absolutely pathetic, didn't expect this from Google. Atleast they should give the option of ""delete only from cloud"".

"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The built in tools are basic unless we upgrade. But even the upgraded version is missing the ability to RESIZE photos prior to sending. It's like they based the app on devices from the late 80's. The camera on my phone is a 64M camera and even setting it to use the smallest resolution it's still 16M which makes pictures at 3500+ x 4000+ pixels in size. The native 64M camera makes raw files at 75Mb each and over 12k x 16k in pixel size. And no ability to RESIZE means looking for another app.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Annoying bug: Sorting on the website does take the timezone into account but on the app doesn't. This means that the order of photos is different (and incorrect) in the app when you have multiple timezones.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Editing photos is impossible. If it doesn't freeze and bug out, you still have the clunky, barely manageable tools that are annoying to use. Not to mention the lack of organization tools. For a Google product this is atrocious"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Unable to send pictures since you took control of this app.. I still can not send pictures and have not been able to figure it out... I really hate how you have taken over the apps and make it so frustrating to get anything done.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I went from having all of my photos and videos saved to my phones gallery, to having everything switched over to Google photos. Now the storage is too full to receive emails from the gmail account, and any photos I delete on google photos removes them from my phones gallery with backup turned off."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Was stuck without internet connection. Went to look at some photos. Couldn't. What use is a gallery app that is useless without a connection? What if I'm out taking pictures in the countryside? Now I can't look at what I've taken until I get home. Utter tripe.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I would give this app zero. There are certain memories from over the years GONE! My photos and videos will never be recovered. I never deleted them ether! I dont know what happened, but it can't be fixed! Google photos used to be great until they weren't!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I swear if this app tries to get me to backup my photos in response to me slecting the option to not back up photos one more time, I will never buy another Google product again. This is the most infuriating application of any I've encountered."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Like the way it stores photos. I wish for the option to remove the date requirements. Cannot find arkives l.p. But all-in-all it is a good storage place. I love these pictures. Thanks I really appreciate the use of this system. The next one I get will be like this one and newer. This is the style that has captured my attention.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Backup management is garbage. If I delete a picture on my device, it doesn't delete the backup, so it keeps taking up space. If I want to delete the backup of a picture on my device, it deletes the one on my device too, even if it's in a folder with BACKUP DISABLED. I just don't understand. Edit: What a worthless response. I know HOW deletion works, that's what I'm complaining about!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Accidentally put some pics on it. Want them back. No way to filter which photos are on GP and which are on my device. Can only see them filtered if I wasn't to delete them. Putting them on GP is easy, very hard to take back off. So essentially Google is keeping your pictures hostage - pay for more storage or lose them. Scumbags. This why people use Apple."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Something fishy is going on with Google photos. I've just started getting crypto related scam messages in Google photos from people that I don't know. This is not the only app that's a Google app that the scammers are using I'm to the point that I'm considering deleting my Google account completely email and all. Google is becoming a monopoly with to much control over our phones at this point.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I would give it a higher rating if my photos/videos would backup while my app is in the background. My photos and videos only backup if the app is opened. This is a real inconvenience because I'm unable to use my phone without my backup being paused until I open the app again.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"When editing photos and using the pen or highlighter, they do absolutely nothing but cause me extreme frustration, because they do absolutely nothing. Fix the glitches in your program!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible. Continuous disturbance asking backing up even I click 'no' so many times, yet disturbing to remind backup everytime. I don't need to trust google for uploading my photos and I am not satisfied with this experience."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Pen tool doesn't work after zooming in on images. This issue isn't something I was dealing with last month so it's rather recent. I've already gone through all the troubleshooting steps.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It says you can share photos everywhere across all devices. And I have an iPhone. And it cannot share over iPhone. They cannot share over Samsung Notes. Cannot share over eye cloud and you can't even. Do any editing on it as far as. Typing or selecting that text b isolated so you could copy and paste the text.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I really like this app. Pictures come out really clear videos are great because you can stop it screen shot your favorite part of the video and sharing them with friends & family makes the best moments that's are more enjoyable to share.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Tried ordering photos and they already take forever as it is to deliver. I can get then done in an hour through any other place why would I wait two weeks. On top of that they are late and although tracking provided it isn't tracking.

That would be amazing! My problem is My photos are all mixed with portrait and landscape photos, and if I could search for only portrait pictures or landscape pictures, then I could separate them to a memory card for my digital picture frame, so I'm not constantly flipping my frame from portrait to landscape every picture."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,When I view photo thumbnails on pixel 8 they look fine but when I opened them to view the full sizes and it after a split second it adds extra layers almost like a negative of a similar photo is added on top. Super frustrating since it appears to be the viewer not the photo.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,We use the paid storage (2T) but cant play any videos even the one those are recent and Only 20 secs long. Not an issue with the network as tried with different network in different places. They are recently backed up video. It's better to save them in a pendrive than in google cloud.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall a pretty good app, stores my photos and I can't really complain about that an awful lot. 2 little nitpicks for me: a) I'd love to be able to copy a picture from my library onto my clipboard, super useful for when a photo you need is finicky to find! b) the ability to choose between camera photos and all device photos to be shown in the photos section Other than that, it's a standard gallery and does the job for me"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Does the job but it has started constantly bugging me about my online storage being almost full. My storage is currently down to 88% full but the photos app keeps bugging me that it is almost full. They are obviously trying to upsell me the extra storage which is an extra cost every month that I have absolutely no interest in. There's got to be a photos app out there that still shows me photos but doesn't bug me trying to sell me things. I'm willing to pay a one-time cost but not every month.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Google Photos is one of the worst photo management ever, even in their own Pixel Pro by Google. Download photos, none show up on this app. I download photos from my main photo backup on Flickr, NONE show up on Google Photos. This is the very reason I ended up returning my previous Pixel pro, and it appears I need to go back to Galaxy because their photo app and media management is superb compared to lame Google Photos. I have no clues why I am even paying Google for storage. Very disappointed!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Google have recently updated the up. For me, it doesn't load correctly, it's lagging. They've also changed the how memories appear. I hate it. Before they were all at the top and you could flick through. Now you have to scroll down and they've all become mixed! Why change something that isn't broken?? Give some choices to your users!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I HATE THIS APP. I don't want a bunch of complicated layouts and groupings. I just want a setting for a simple grid, all the same size, no moving videos and photos, I don't want to loose all my markers on favorites when I transfer things over, I want to SHUT OFF suggested memory's and similar photos of only 3 randomly selected grouped together. Group all similar photos or none The whole app is way too complicated and visually over stimulating. I 100% regret backing up all my photos to this app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love how Google photos has some very sweet options and tons and tons of storage space for videos and photos and a great application for memories! I love how you can print your photos and have them sent to CVS. With Google one and Google photos you can save however many pictures and videos you want and also you can make collages and blow up your photos. I like the fact that you can order a photo album with you pictures! And I like how you can make a video/photos with music! Love this app!!!
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I had 5 phones that got stolen and the 8 phones that I misplaced. Out of all them I have only ever recovered pictures from 2 of those devices. I had them stored in this app. I can not find at least 1000 pictures that I really want and yes need because they were of my daughter growing up and 6 animals that passed away, I had so many important special memories that I can no longer cherish. I really wish I could get them back, because my memory is not like it once was."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Horrible. photos are not stored properly. Many recent photos have disappeared or now show "" unsupported format"" even if format if jpg. I tried all the steps suggested. They did not help at all. Getting very frustrated. I take a photo. It appears for a few minutes just fine. Then an hour later it's just a blank square. I click on info and it says file note compatible. This never happened until the latest update. STOP UPDATING PROGRAMS THAT WORK JUST FINE. Updated only screw things up."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Typical, simple photo app. Very easy to acclimate to. The only issue is it being a Google app, once you're out of space, it's unusable.. unless you clean out a substantial amount of data, or you pay monthly for more space. There are other apps that you never have to pay for.. and you won't be forced to delete and forego backups."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've never had a phones photo directory be so useless and difficult. I need settings to permanently stop asking me to back-up my photos, disable ""Albums"" (I got folders thanks), and remove the memories tab from the apps home bar.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Decent app, but plz stop trying to turn this into a ""social media"", i don't need constant pop-ups telling me about random new features I don't care for, or a pop up telling me I've edited a photo every single time. This is a gallery app, stop trying to add random things that create clutter, or at least give us the ability to turn off those ""features"""
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It works because I pay for it. One thing that is really annoying is I don't have the option to overwrite what I edited and keep saving a new copy. I believe that Google is always finding a way to fill up your storage and then eventually you upgrade. When you download a picture from the Google photos online storage it get lost in your phone. Very hard to find.

After countless notification that I was exceeding the usage limit on Google Drive, I made a conscious decision to delete all of my photos from Drive and turn off backup. I don't want to pay Google for more space, and I already have a backup solution. Now, every time I open photos, I have to select ""no"" to decline turning on backup. This is asinine. I disabled the photos app and installed an alternate."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Recent updates are like forcing me to switch from pixel to any other phone with some other gallery app. Too much advertisements from google to use their subscription of cloud storage when my free usage is exceeded and if I turn off automatic upload it's prompting to turn it on again which results in the subscription advertisement problem. One of the major reasons I've stopped recommending pixel phones to others.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,For what only has to be a picture viewer is full of options that are totally useless u can't see if the file is online or local its just cluttered mess unfriendly to use it sorts items the way the app likes for me it's a random mess. And Im going nuts U watching images enhance with hdr click it away another so called enhancement why don't you get lost it ruined every picture I ever tried it om and I can't hide the damn annoyance
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Notification spamming to turn on backup for photos and videos is very irritating and manipulative. You can't stop the notification and anything related from showing. Extremely disruptive when you want to quickly show a photo in the said app and it shows the notification instead.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Being this far into existing and still getting stuck (""preparing to back up 26 items""...then never does) when backing up photos is unacceptable for one of the largest tech companies in the world. Especially when running with a fully updated, recent Android phone."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I like everything about photos in the Google account. The way that the app connects with other apps and prompts you for the choice in applications that you're working with makes things a lot easier to handle everyday tasks whether you're at work or not. . I wish I knew how to free up more storage with Google.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app allows me to take only 15 GB of photos then tells me I'm out of room and have to delete some files or my photos won't be backed up. I've got 250Gb of room on my phone, and I don't care about back ups. I just want to take pictures and stop seeing the stupid advertising to purchase more backup space for a monthly rate. Go away already. Let me use my phone memory like I planned."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I hate the popup blurry option, if I had wanted them blurry to begin with I would have taken them that way. Let users have the choice instead of having to deal with one more thing to close. Put it under notifications or whatever. Just saying but don't see it happening."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is not very user friendly. It infrequently uploads to cloud storage and will delete pictures from another app without permission (that I am aware of giving or not).

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Absolutely horrible. Very invasive and constantly corrupting the photos and videos. You cannot even open them sometimes. Plus now they change to edit and play with you own pictures. And always pushing you to back them up to who knows where
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I have no choice of which to save/not save..it's all or none. Same with deleting..it's delete a photo everywhere or waste valuable space.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very disappointed. I recently went from s20 to pixel, and if I knew about this issue, I wouldn't have gotten this phone. I had to transfer over 1k photos. Yes they were all transferred, but only saved though this app which is only online and attached to your Google account. I had no idea absolutely none are actually saved to this device. So if someone hacks your google account, you lose all your pictures too. And there is no way to download all at once. It will take me hours to complete. Shame."

The photos also come back after I deleted from my phone, which is very annoying, and I just have no way to disconnect or alter my google photo account to other folders in my phone.

My dead family members helped me identify many people in scanned photos and then they vanished overnight. Wasted effort and now my family members are dead I couldn't get them back. Update Feb 24.

I didn't had any more storage and the provided solution was to pay for extra storage.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,WARNING -Do not give this app any permissions. This is the worst app I have ever had the displeasure of using.

Once I get my photos out of here I will never use them again hopefully I can use my pixel camera and find a third party to handle my gallery and block photos from any of my future shots.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"WHHHY does this app have to constantly ask if I want to turn on photo backup? With no way to stop it from doing so.

Why can't I see the folders as they're structured on my device instead of laying every subfolder out so I have to scroll through them all to find what I'm looking for since you didn't at least have the decency to alphabetize them?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I think my explanation is pretty clear... When I transferred my photos from my old phone I lost all my albums.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I like the way it seperates the pictures into months & years. I like that you can order prints & canvas prints from this app. It's harder to organize pictures together in a group & add captions since I upgraded to this app. Sandra Huntley

"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"(Update: Error was fixed.) The app worked good at first, but I keep getting an error when I swipe photos up were you can move them to albums or see were they were took. It keeps crashing, then wants me to delete the app and reinstall it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Too busy trying to look at your stuff, that's why these photos apps lag, freeze up, like iPhones, they are eavesdropping. Gallery was mastered a decade ago there's no excuse for the poor performance. Stop scanning peoples images!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is awful compared to the galaxy gallery. Besides the terrible fact that it ignores decide storage so you have to pay for google drive space, it has almost no features and it bugs out like crazy. Everything takes longer to do, if you can even do it on this app, than any other gallery app. I am actually gonna trade this phone out so I dont have to use google's terrible apps."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Please add in-built app lock. Not Locked Folder, proper authentication Lock with Face Unlock or Fingerprint unlock. Also, please increase the base storage of Google Accounts on Pixel Devices and Add options to deselect Camera Folder, Videos altogether and more. Overall the App is my favourite Gallery App. Make the UI more smooth and Material You based."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I like the features, but I'm looking for a less buggy alternative that isn't limiting with storage. The storage limit is pathetic even with Google one membership. What is the solution? More money... the moment I find the better alternative, I'm switching over."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Constant nagging to backup online is getting so annoying. I've switched it off but you keep pushing for me to use it. If it's switched off I don't want to use it, end of story. So ditch the constant nagging to use it."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"IF I want to move photos to another folder, it should be to another location ON MY DEVICE, NOT to the shitcloud. Pop ups to ""back up"" photos to the shitcloud are irritating. When I say NO, it means NO, you creeps!!! I shouldn't have to keep telling the app NO. STOP trying to bad-touch my photos, google, they're mine, NOT yours!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"the photo thumbnails went from 4 to now 5 per line. they are so small that they are useless had to uninstall the update and revert to previous version. update.. the developers reply is a joke. if you have an article on fixing issues, just fix them. don't force the user to search for fixes"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This update breaks the ability to edit from within the camera app. It took.me a day to figure out it was this app that breaks it. Uninstall the update and it works. Please fix! The response from Dev team provided no useful information and gave me a non functional URL to read.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's been years since I've downloaded this app, and it's unfortunate to see that the biggest issue has not been fixed: Even if you say no to backups, the contents of your phone will be backed up regardless. This was a pain to deal with last time, so I don't think I'll be holding onto this app again for very long."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I would love this app so much more if the back up to the server was quicker. I rely on this for my job. Trying to access media from the desktop takes forever to back up. It doesn't save me when I have a deadline.

No way to get them back, not showing up in the trash at all, nothing."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The portrait mode on the pixel 7 and onward is comically bad. We used to be able to disable it post capture, but it seems since the 6 that's not possible. I'm never using that again."

It still works without Internet and more than THIS excuse for a photo editor. trim,blur,crop,paste,&FX. Also youcut can combine videos. As a content creator I specifically recommend youcut to YouTube & Tic-Tok Creators."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is so annoying. Every time you want to have a photo on your phone but not on here it uploads anyways, which makes it literally impossible to have it returned to just your phone because every time you want it off this app it removes it from your phone."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Google photos has changed to many things an not pleased at all. A lot of of videos and pictures are going to be desinktive obslete just about every thing I have in videos and pictures. So I don't have anything left to see. Yeah it's not private and you even know it.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Changlog is not clear. Missing folders view.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Didnt even intentionally used this app. I find out my google Drive storage is full, it was google photos that filled it up. I deleted the photos without backup or sync even turned on, and it deleted them from my device losing over 5k worth of photos. Thanks, Google."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I have a suggestion for improvement. It would be great if there was an option to create security albums without the need for screen lock in my phone. This would provide more convenience while still ensuring privacy.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Nice, very convenient until you try to export anything, they make it very difficult to download videos and pictures directly from the phone and they want you to keep buying more storage, the same way they make it easy to save they should make it easy to download."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Absolutely Terrible! Can't move photos from folder to album and remove folder. Deleting photo from folder will simultaneously remove it from photo album. Anticipated better programming from Google engineers. Very disappointing.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The recent updates are destroying the usability of the app. In the photos section now you have a mix of images downloaded from social media apps and various camera photos. PLEASE LET US CHOOSE HOW TO USE THE APP. The photos section should be somewhere else not first thing to show in the app. Camera section should be visible first.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,A personal favourite. I only wish I could make my content shorter as I have over 7500 pics there and there's multiple copies of the same pic in different folders. ONLY WISH I COULD FIND AN APP THAT SWEPT AND DELETED THE MULTIPLE COPIES so I can get real with the amount of pics I have.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"How come when I tell my phone to update over GSM with no limits it still says that it can't update to the cloud and I'm still waiting on photos to update, I need these photos but I can't access them on my other devices and it wants Wi-Fi but I don't have any Wi-Fi to give it. I would like a way to not need Wi-Fi to upload my photos as the setting suggests."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Never downgrade a great feature away! ""Movie"" was gone. Replaced by a mediocre Highlight Video function which lacks the same intuitive editing interface and transitions etc."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I give this app a 5 star rating ! First of all, speaking as a person who is not computer savvy, the app is easy to use.

Thanks, Google photos, for helping me build my business! ‚ô°KC"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Introduce Folders and make the app work fast. It's super slow even with a flagship and good internet connection. Note- The issue can't be solved by us, the developers need to add folders and smoothness."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,App is great things work smoothly but I find 2 very important features 1. Video Filter: a simple filter to divide photos and videos 2. Bulk download on App we have on web/dekstop but missing on the app. These seems simple but would be very useful.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Usually 5 stars but nothing seems to works all of a sudden. Can look at pics but can't edit, sceen slows then turns white and it keeps telling me clear cache but that's already been done. Cmon google your the best at this so no excuses just please fix"

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm sick and tired of the same bugs for YEARS that I report EVERY time they occur through the in-app feedback mechanism with excruciating detail, and they never get fixed. It's infuriating. EDIT: 500 characters in a Google Play Store review is not enough to describe the various bugs, and this isn't even the right mechanism for those kinds of diagnostics. How about y'all look up the hundreds of reports I've submitted over the years and email me back, as I've said is okay? Reducing to 1 star."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Cant see location on shared photos. Having multiple Apps is pretty useless when they all connect to the same Google drive, why not just integrate all the features from the other apps into one? Except for yt."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Pure frustration. This app is so sub par compared to any other photo app. Why are you even charging for member photo features?? They rarely do anything to improve the photo. Why can I only use certain photo features with certain photos?? I don't need AI to decide which ones I can use! I want access to ALL features provided for ANY PHOTO. Why do I have to perform a special permission grant for my default photo app?? Why is it not just automatic?? Why can only some phones and OS capable of this??
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have a large amount of storage on my phone to avoid being harassed by online services. God forbid I have the option to keep my photos and videos. I hate Google and how they get to decide what I get to do with my data. They proceed to remove all my photos I downloaded from my computer and move them to their stupid drive. Then wonderfully enough, take away the feature to move them back to the phone. I have to download each one individually. I absolutely despise this company."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Generally pretty good ; a bit frustrating that the experience on the app differs to that on the web for the product. The skew feature could be made a bit easier to use (cough the gram cough).
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"[VERY ANXIOUS!] Just accidentally pressed free up space, expecting it to give me options from what Google imagines I don't want. Instead the Photos app seems to have taken it upon itself to delete about 500mB of data, but I've no idea what's gone, or why, or how I get it back, or IF I can get it back, or if I can get it back AS IT WAS, or how I find out what's gone or where it's gone FROM or.....

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Keeps getting notification that the app is not working every minute. Even the app is really not working. I forced closed it, disabled it and nothing works after the recent update. Fed up with so many notifications"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The usual annoying Google experience. Constantly asking to back up your photos somewhere you told no repeatedly. Collects data completely unrelated to the purpose of this app. You can't open in library tab directly.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Whenever I try to use the magic edit AI feature on the photo appon my Pixel 8 Pro it crashes. Given that the phone is being sold on its AI integration this is highly frustrating. I've tried restarting the phone, emptying the photo app cache and data, none of which helped"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Every other photo won't save after trying to edit/crop them. 'Error while saving photo' message. Everything up to date and on Pixel 8 pro. Restarting the phone and uninstalling updates made no difference. Bit rubbish TBH.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Im furious.... 1TB storage paid and i can't even download multiple photos to my device. This is unbelievable. One by one on the app?.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app. Easy to use interface, fast loading pictures, and sharable to many app outlets. I rated 4 stars because Id like to see a ""See more like this"" button for stylized pictures, and an easier way to group these"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I would give this negative stars if I could. I'm positively pissed off that this is what I am stuck with as a preloaded app by the phone I bought through my carrier. Out of no where it now wants me to pay for the option to edit my photos. I wish I'd have stayed with the Samsung Galaxy.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Google photos doesn't provide option to skip video uploads. If we delete the videos from Google photos it deletes the video from my phone as well.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So I'm biased with anything that ""Google"" makes cause I love Google and things they make ex. Maps, Lens, YouTube, and hopefully this yeah I'll be getting a Pixel phone, I think a Pixel phone and Photos will be the the ultimate duo for editing photos on the go."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"How have they not fixed the ""fail to trash"" issue yet? I just got this pixel 8 pro phone 3 days ago and I am disappointed that Google hasn't fixed such an easy issue but a super annoying issue. Resetting the phone every time I want to use Google photos or organize is brutal."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I thought that the ""backup"" option that's backing up the photos from my phone. I turned it off, yet my photos are still being backed up here... So what's the option that disables this, then?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Photo editer used to have it where you could see what you were typing. Now you have to guess at it. Also you could enlarge the typing or decrease it. Now you have to enlarge the photo if you want the typing decreased. Forget about marking things out. You again have to increase your photo and then hoping you dont make a mistake or else start over again. One swipe you could see what you've done. Now its a guessing game until you save it. It takes about 3 saves and 5 min to get it all done.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I dont recommend this app. I downloaded all my photos to my phone from Google photos, and the dates and locations are all messed up and incorrect. I tried 3 separate times and same thing happens."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Functional app but I am desperately waiting for a feature to identify duplicates and delete them. It seems already implemented in the app because it was proposed to me once when I installed the app, but no way to do it again."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I edit a photo and it won't save. Can't screenshot and send it. I'm so beyond annoyed with this since my business is based on my damn pictures. I hate android phones and all these BS updates that usually stop me from being able to do anything on my phone until I contact my provider.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Not a bad app, however wish Google would respect my decision to not sync to the cloud and stop asking me all the time. Why this process, following up a 'no' decision with a smaller list of photos... What about syncing these photos? Still no."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love a lot about it. It's easy to organize photos, share, and the memory reminders great! The things that bother me is not being able to search within an album and not being able to automatically add photos to an album only if 2 people I choose are in it together. Please add the options. Another odd thing is the photo it auto selected to be the main photo of a person is terrible. It used to be one of me with my eyes half closed and now it's a really bad photo of me from 20 years ago."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's good to keep track of your photos and videos. However there's 3 flaws i can think of right now: 1. The app keeps crashing when trying to edit photos. Even after clearing the storage it didn't fix it. 2. Sometimes when you are trying to move some pictures from folder to folder, it says there was an error moving this picture or video so you have to use file manager instead. 3. When moving photos and videos to a new folder (mainly large amounts), the photos are in random order."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Clicked ""free up space"" thinking that would delete duplicate photos etc to give me back some of my free allowance, but it deleted ALL the photos and videos from my phone memory!!! EVERYTHING!!! I didn't want that to happen and there was no warning that this would happen - not even an ""are you sure you want to do this?"". Absolutely devastated as I've lost around 3000 photos and videos in full quality that are now only saved in inferior quality. Thanks a lot Google!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Collages are unprintable! I love all the features on this app, but after spending a while adjusting collages to my liking, thinking they would make nice prints on canvas or in a photo book, I discovered they are too tall and narrow for any print sizes available. Furthermore, there is no option to just add additional background to the sides, so the pictures at the top and bottom of the collage are just cut off, either completely, or leaving the subjects headless. Could you please fix this?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love the app. It's generally easy to use and has good features. However, ot would be great if there is a way to filter the pictures in the all photos tab. For example to be able to see only photos that are not in any album which can make it much easier to delete the extra photos we don't need. Also, the video creator has so many glitches. For example, when inserting a video in it, sometimes it doesn't play it properly. It often takes so long time for the video to be finalized."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1. Long screenshots can't be backuped up which is ridiculous. 2. Easy in-app feedback feature was removed. 3. Still can't easy delete all the stored photos at will. 4. There is no way to sort files in albums. 5. There's no way to merge albums. 6. There's no way to select all files. 7. There is no easy way to tell if a file was created after free space in the apk ended.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"As a photo storage app this is great. Stores all my photos from phones, laptops, for free and depending on the quality you choose it can be unlimited storage. Its nice to have one place where all my pictures live especially since I have switched phones and switched between iPhone and android. I took one star down because the widget needs improvement. the size and formatting of the widget is poorly functioning. I may stretch the widget to fit the screen but it is cut off or too small."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The, ""edit,"" button for rearranging photos is useless, and Google appears to have no interest in fixing the issue. I can only move one image at a time and if I try to do more then a couple it just starts throwing them around to random locations after I try moving it. I've tried clearing the cache data and storage which solves it for maybe 5 seconds, before it breaks again. Please fix this problem instead of just blaming someone else for it. You're the brain here so show it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"No longer works properly. I like my photos to be arranged with the newest first. Some of my older albums are set to this. Any new album I create, changing the organisation to newest fails every time. I have deleted and reinstalled the app. I have restarted my phone. Nothing works and it's absolutely infuriating. This app used to be fantastic but now there are too many bugs and not a single fix."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Does anybody remember Google Photos from at least 13 years ago? Back then, the Photos app actually had the most wonderful editing options. It had frames and filters and you could edit certain parts of the photo you wanted to change. The frames were amazing. They had a whole bunch of film effects that did amazing edits, and then it all went away and they wouldn't even let us choose to keep the old version. Our phones wouldn't work without their shifty update. Tell me why?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have had this app since 2020. I enjoy all the features it offers. the albums are great for organizing and storing. The edit feature is one of my favourite. With over 6,000 photos,it is nice to know they are safe in backup. The collage feature is fun. Love the automatic picture feature. The pictures set to music is great. Google photos is a good app. So have fun with it. Love the new memories section."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Average at best for editing photos. Pretty much every photo editing app out there is superior, but even worse is when you try to edit a photo that's been backed up to the cloud storage and it tells you that it's 'Unable to edit. Check your connection' and doesn't even let you download it again so that you can edit it with a photo editing app that is actually fit for purpose. Nothing wrong with my connection. Check your servers, Google!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I used to love this app, but quality is getting worse. Today I bought a Pixel 8 Pro, setting up the library again took forever, basically I had to go to sleep and when I woke up it had finished. Not the best experience, it could do with some progress indicator or at least preview the latest pics, after all, the website doesn't need to do all that caching and can still show something initially."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am impressed with this app. It has seamlessly allowed me to back up my cherished memories ever since. The convenience it offers is unparalleled, with a user-friendly interface that simply requires common sense to navigate. Serving as my virtual photo album, I appreciate the meticulous organization of my albums and the effortless ability to locate shared photos with friends and family. The app is valuable now, and I'm excited for future improvements. It's definitely a worthwhile investment."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a great application for the goal it is trying to accomplish. It could use a few tweaks to the navigation and navigation settings to make it easier for editing my photos and albums and picture selecting. But overall keeps your pictures through separate emails and phone numbers and phones in between Apple, and Android; which is much more than what this app was initially intended to be but still could use a bit more customization for more advanced users. I can help make a tweak on the code"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There's two major flaws with Google Photos in my opinion - the fact that your photos are automatically sorted into albums/there's no way to browse all photos, and the Save Copy function instead of having the choice to overwrite the original photo. These two small details really bring down the user experience for me and I'd love to see Google offer a more streamlined app!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Each update leads to different parts of the app being rearranged. Please stop doing that. Leave it alone or allow the user to rearrange the app how they want it. I want a seamless experience but if the features keep moving around it isn't seamless. Also, the locked folder could be improved. If I put a photo in it I'd like to remove the photo from the gallery. That is the point of having a private folder."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I literally got the Pixel 8 Pro for photos and editing. Literally as soon as I find a new filter for scenery and equipment shots that's perfect, the filter tab is suddenly, and entirely empty when attempting to edit any photo! What gives Google?! EDIT: I've tried everything suggested other than uninstalling the app. I have folders that aren't backed up and I'm not willing to lose them. There was a security update that did not automatically install, but there has been no change since updating."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Since the last update photos taken with the Phone camera will show normally for about a second, then automatically boost the light sources in the picture. I could not find a way to turn this ""feature"" off. While some photos might look better with the ""enhancement"", the big issue is that the photos you see in the photos app will be very different than the same photos you share on another app. Please give users a way to disable this nonsense, or turn it into a tool in the image editor."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pixel 7 Pro. Mostly good apart from 2 annoying features... 1. When I view photos in landscape, there is often a dark bar at the top of the picture, which seems to be a left over from the menu bar. 2. When I add an album and the sort order is most recent photo, the album is created right at the bottom of all my albums and only moves to the top after about 5 minutes or so."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Are you serious? A photo app and backup app that does not let you actually download photos when you need them again? Are you trying to hold them hostage? You can only open and select and download one photo at a time?!!! And after two or three clicks to get there? What the hell are you thinking with an app that doesn't let you easily select and download multiple of my own files you want to edit and share? Insane! Now I have to switch back to OneDrive. uuuugh! Make good design decisions!
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Google Photos for 6+ years and it's my favourite photo app. In the past 2 years, I've had minor issues like: ‚Ä¢ Video rendering: Videos record well, but will be choppy & almost √ó2 speed in the app with no sound. Not a frequent issue though. ‚Ä¢ Markup: I wish there was an option to change the size of the pen/highlighter, (even if it was just a 3-size option). ‚Ä¢ Photo syncing: Adequate storage & connection, but won't sync (rare). Other than that, I love Google Photos!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"For just generic backups it works great but if you want any sort of photo management, look somewhere else. You can only scroll by month in your main photos tab which is useless when you're trying to work through vacation photos, you can't download images from a shared library directly (you have to save them to your library, then find the photo, then download it), and it's just a pain to download and organize photos into albums. These are fairly basic features - do better Google. I expected more."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If you're looking for an editor that 1) crashes the entire app when you try to edit a video, necessitating a full restart of your phone, or 2) hard crashes your entire OS/phone (mine: Pixel 7) when you try to edit a video, then this is the photo app for you! Been going on for weeks. Actively researching replacements, even if I have to pay. Edit: Google's responses are beyond useless. Most links provided aren't even real. Did extensive troubleshooting before leaving review. Trash company."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My photos aren't in the app. Some appear but 99% can only be accessed from my Files app. Sorting is just bad (no sub folders is a pain for someone with many pictures). When editing, you can only ""Save as copy"" so you have to delete the original after editing. The only feature I needed and used (adjusting pictures of documents) became premium and now I can only rely on the ""Automatic"" button. Wish I could delete this app but it's preinstalled. Gotta find a decent gallery app additionally now."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I LOVE this app, it's very easy to use and wonderful for my photos, not to mention a great and cheap way to store my photos, and keep them from getting lost. It's very organized, and has wonderful features such as letting you create albums to organize your photos even more than by dates. The only problem I have with it, is that when I try to use Face Identification sometimes it doesn't sense a face as being there, and won't let me pare it. I'd like to be able to do that. Otherwise, love it!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When opening the editor it takes about 30 seconds before you can do anything. There is a 'loading' line that goes across the bottom of the screen several times. This is on a pixel 7 pro!!! After it cycles and you can edit, everything goes smoothly and the edits are beautiful. Edit: Also the edit buttons change positions depending on what the program thinks you will use. Please just leave the buttons where they are, I can find the tools I need."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"2023 - I don't know whether I'm coming or going most times w/pboto app, BUT I found overall this photo app is better than most. I have to do a little more work trying to get the photos where I want them so I can find them with less hassle. When I do figure it out it works great until you change stuff. Just leave things alone (except where absolutely necessary) for awhile & give us a chance to do albums or whatever without another learning curve. Yet, I'm sticking with you for now!"

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is a scam. Telling you to back up your photos, only for it to quickly fill up, then you can't delete any of them because it will delete them on your device. Google should be ashamed and charged with fraud on the grandest scale."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely perfect. Without any hesitation, I recommend this app to whoever who mean photos/vedio/audio, and even documents saving and storing business."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Needs refinement for power users. Why did the way RAW files stored change? It used to be that I can go and pick HD versions and RAW files seperately. But now every app that accesses the photos has TWO versions of the some photo, jpeg and dng. Im on a pixel 7 pro, i am assiming this goes for all pixels. Good idea to store them together, bad execution. Let us seperate them again please. Also snapseed edits are not an album for some reason, it saves it with the same photo, making it hard to find."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Don't know what google did to this app, but when I take a photo, apparently if I try to view the photo too soon after taking it, Google deletes the photo!! This is absolutely horrible for taking pictures while touring. Photo often can't be retaken due to traveling out of range. Hate it!! Another example of an update being worse than the old version. Of it ain't broke don't fix it?? Leave things alone!!!!!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App won't open after asking me about backup options. I have a Pixel 8 Pro and I can't reach my photo album anymore. When I open the album, it asks me whether I want to have a backup on Google Drive, and I click on ""turn off backup"". After that, the circle keeps moving and the app just can't move further than that. I can't do anything on the app!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Unnecessary innovations driven by middle management need to ""add"" something to app to justify a quarterly review process and possible raise, namely grouping similar photos in unneeded, unrequested ""stack"" that adds work to the users' experience in finding photos."

Now you have to go to the Google Photos website, which is just slow and clunky. Such a waste of time ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Why are there absolutely no features for removing photos from backup but not from local device storage? This makes the app effectively useless (and actively precarious) to me and just locks me out of using Google services once I run out of storage.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"So much potential to be 5 stars, but some aspects don't seem to be fully functional. The locked folder doesn't work the way it should. The photo selection screen to upload pictures to it doesn't show all of the photos in Google photos. But that's the only screen you can use to send photos to the locked folder, there's no option to send a photo you see on a normal screen to the locked folder."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This is the worst experience that I have had in years. I CAN'T FIND my photos! Why in the world can't you make this a straight forward thing. I have no control over my own files & pictures. These devices are hooked to Google. Does Google have a stake in every company that makes phones and tablets? When the app takes and stores my photos, they should be stored in a folder that says ""Photos"" so I can just click on it. I shouldn't click on 1/2 dozen things to get to my photos! Change it!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Was great until it started auto enhancing all my photos and ruining the quality. Every time I take photo and I like it it automatically changes it with the HDR and ruins it and there's no way to turn it off

It's worse with every update. I don't need pictures from 2 years ago to come up as my recent. When I archived my photos. They're the ones that come more often than the ones I took a minute ago. It's backwards. It takes A Lot of time to get it to revert back to the other way. The download time is ridiculous too. It has fun features.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app works really well and does a great job at doing minor edits to the photos you take. I do think it was a big mistake to remove free unlimited storage for Pixel phones moving forward, it would have been a really nice perk to keep and entice more Pixel sales. Some of the newer features don't work very well, e.g. the ""Best Take"" feature force closes the app on a brand new Pixel 8"

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Why do all my videos and photos in this app look absolutely terrible when I go back to watch a video or look at a pic. It definitely did not look like that before Google got their hands on it. I'm not sure why I'm paying for this app and extra storage because you're mutilating my videos. If I have a 10 minute video shot in 1080 I have to sit through at least 5 minutes of blurry garbage and then maybe I'll get a few minutes of the 1080 before it looks like a blurry watercolor painting again

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"One of the most frustrating apps Google could come up with. Finding anything in photos app is a challenge, because if it's not a photo taken with the phone camera it'll automatically end up being filed in one of the library folders!! There isn't an option for having all jpegs and related showing up in the main view! If that wasn't enough the app will literally bully you into signing up for paid cloud backup.

After processing it, it goes from looking like a normal photo to an over sharpened, filtered, popped, image. Google never fixed this over processing issue when taking a photo.

Great memories. Great albums. Doesn't matter if I cant use this to do what I want with it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Avoid this obvious trap for your images. It will delete locally if you're not careful. Leaves no easy option to backup to phone as well once your images are uploaded.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"You guys simply NEED to let us zoom in and out in albums. My library is extensive, and so are my albums, having all my photos crammed in with no option to zoom out makes it unbelievably inconvenient to find photos inside albums. And the absurd thing is, we can already do that in the library tab, or the favorites tab, why not in the albums which is the whole point of Google Photos? Also, adding a ""select all"" option would be nice for management."

A great while back, at the urging of Google, I paid for the extra storage space because they were going to delete vast amounts of the stuff I had saved. Supposedly after I bought said storage I wouldn't have to worry it. Obviously that was just talk. A large amount of my photos have up and disappeared. Nothing like paying for something and not getting it, huh?"

I've complained about this many times and nothing seems to be done about it. The favourites is useful since I usually save a lot of edits on my phone and it saves me from checking each folder I have for the best ones. Please fix this for crying out loud.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Everything else good except photos backing up all contents of DCIM folder. Folders of DCIM should be separate so it doesn't backup useless FB photos and screenshots.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It's nice but I do have a problem with it. About a month ago my device was low on storage so I decided to delete some pictures and the app gave me an option of saving space which I agreed with and did but the problem's I haven't been able to see let alone retrieve those pictures and videos. I keep searching but can find none of them. It's really a big issue to me because there are over 70 photos and videos missing. I would like if this issue is rectified as soon as possible.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app doesn't always work on my phone, especially with shared albums. It takes ages (sometimes weeks) to upload photos in shared albums. Sometimes I can't view photos shared by my friends. And worst of all, I can't open some shared albums at all. It will be loading for days or even weeks, while my other friends can view them. I have tried to update my app and restart my phone but still with the same results."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"No practicality at all. Can't MOVE pictures from one album to another, only COPY them and then have to remove the photos from the one album you first copied. Want to upload photos from your phone? Doesn't detect all the photo albums on your phone, so good luck trying to get this app to detect them, only shows photos in chronological order so have fun scrolling down, don't mess up!

Edit: I've recently performed a factory reset which did not resolve the issue. Editing the date and time is not an options as I don't recall when the photos were initially taken.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,the old version is better. Better Better.. repetative updates simply clogs up the phone memory and slows it down. Why does a photo management app need huge storage to work?? Adding further: it keeps popping up the update app message. There should be an option to disable it. Nobody wants to go through a buch of tutorials to learn how to disable an app service. This is a mess! That's not what people use apps on Google Play Store for!
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I don't like photos deleted by Google that's for me to decide I mean why bother to take a picture to remember a certain time if Google is just going to come along and delete it. I'm not computer savvy so I don't know how to do a lot on my phone so why don't you just leave my memories alone or do I have to get an Apple phone to do away with Google

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't want the Documents options. The Documents options can't be changed or deleted or otherwise have photos removed from them, so what's the point?

They don't group them well and it's not impressive, it's creepy."

This app is terrible: no way to manage albums, no way to transfer (Huawei), no way to create truly hidden folders. Even deleting photos requires so much work. Perhaps if I had used it from the beginning, I would like it, as I know it has useful tools. But transferring when you have close to 10,000 photos on your device, which were previously well organised, is a time sink I simply don't card to do."

Google has the most bright and clear, colorful photos. There's different options too that's very useful , doesn't have too worry about unnecessary changes in features. I will always recommend Google photos apps and stand firmly behind it."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"why is google photos acting like a gallery app on the phone, it shouldn't show photos from albums that are not synced (set to be backed up). it shows photos from all my albums when I go on the app, just as it would if I was to go on the default gallery app and click all photos. stupid. it should only show photos that are already in google photos and photos that are pending to be backed up from the synced folders."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Really bad user interface. File management, album options, facial recognition, the whole thing is a nightmare. Google uses this app to lean into their AI and try to streamline everything and make it appear to be futuristic and advanced but this is a perfect example of how poor AI technology really is. I wind up with 6 folders of my dog, the AI thinking all are different dogs. I try and tell it to sort them together under my one named dog as I have no manual override. No use."

When I looked for the original photo... its gone! Other photos are also missing. Now I've noticed that TWO entire albums have disappeared from one android device but not a second android device. Cleared cache, updated the app... nothing. The main purpose of Google photos is backup. I'm a Google One customer and can't believe I'm actually paying for this."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Vile user interface. Nearly no features for managing your pictures beyond vauge albums. If I designed this system to make as many people buy extra space as possible, I would do this: Auto-backup all images on the user's device, but not organize them. Make it as difficult as possible to delete photo/groupings. Make it difficult to download specific areas. Have no downloading options. Use the UI to discourage going far back in chronological order. Push the Low Space Warning with every interaction."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is a trash it takes so long to load images' thumbnails which are stored locally !! When I want to find a picture in a local library or to delete some, i quit it, because its just so annoying to wait for them to load and the phone gets warm because it builds the thumbnails every time you open the app. And the app don't suggest you feed unless you upload photos to Google drive. This is what android experience like when you compare it to ios."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Google is yet again doing very stupid app design and development. There is a button on the right where most people scroll beside each month and year that selects all pictures for that timeframe. I inadvertently selected the button without realizing as I was scrolling to select individual pictures to be deleted and ended up permanently deleting an entire month of pics. I would like to know why Google decided to place that button on the side where most users would scroll from. No common sense.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This was a favorite app until it started advertising with what appears to be Amazon for printing photos. Also when I wasn't able to log in to my Google account I wasn't able to access years of saved photos and since most of our photos were taken with a smartphone that stopped using memory cards and the trust was that those photos were saved to a safe, accessable place, it is very disappointing simple things like changing a phone number or forgetting a password will lock you out of what's saved."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There are extremely common popups that are hard to avoid that back up your photos, and no way to undo that action after you hit one of them. I take it this is to get me to buy storage space but it is the most predatory practice I've ever seen in a Google app. There is no way to stop seeing these popups that I'm aware of so they just wait for you to make mistake and hit backup, and then to get them off of the cloud you have to disable sync and delete the pictures from another device."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's so annoying that Google photos doesn't save my videos in the correct album, causing it to duplicate, and then it just messes it up when I'm editing. When I move the videos to the correct album, it then disappears on my editing app. And it backs up those videos that I don't want to be backed up. Can't even delete it from the cloud without it being deleted from my device."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am unable to access albums directly in my gallery. Google Photos makes me have to go through all 260,000 photos rather than being able to upload specific albums. It's really inconvenient."

Several photos are not showing up in Google photos although they were taken successfully by Camera and are accessible via Files app. Edit: No, ""Tap on Photos and Try scrolling down to see what else is there."" did not help. The photos appeared after several hours, maybe because I connected to a WiFi. Now I cannot reproduce the issue anymore, maybe after Photos did the automatic backup, it managed to get out of a broken state."

This one is way cheaper, and for me, I can save all my photos from the past 15 years, and I still have so much space. Granted, I am paying yearly, but I am paying less than haft I was for iCloud. Also, using the search option makes life so much easier. You can name photos so it automatically organizes everything for you."

Clear cache, force stop, restart phone... None of them works. It also takes forever when I see 'processing' especially portrait mode.

It also will randomly delete chunks of photos off your phone and transfer them to Google photos. The point of this app was so I could have Back Ups of my photos that i could later be able to download them onto a new device, or transfer them elsewhere. But you are not able to do this. All it does it hold your photos. You can only download photos ONE AT A TIME. Use another app. THIS is a scam."

Ive tried everything - clearing cache, rolling back updates, updating again - nothing helps! can't edit photos, can't delete photos, I can't set photos as wallpaper, I can't even open photos a few times! Disappointing will be a understatement, this is a mockery of a photo app! I regret getting an Pixel phone!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Don't need this reminder to backup your photos to the cloud. I have my own way to back things up and I do not need Google's way. Stop asking. I have had to help parents to reverse their decision on cloud backups which has caused hassle and losing photos. Horrible experience. No way to turn off that notification. Stop trying to be so smart. It's literally stupid.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is t just useless it's dangerous. It messes up your photo stores, tries to sync everything online and then messes up local storage... So many spinning circles and nothing. Now multiple copies of everything and things are in wrong order. Simple rotate photo mixed on device and cloud. Why so reliant on cloud Google?? Snoop snoop otherwise why would you do anything? Where is the alternative? Nothing but your real poor app. Very unimpressed."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app isn't connected with Instagram or any other apps in general. It's impossible to find pictures on a device, because other apps can't see Google Photos' albums. They can't see it, because albums in the Photos are not new folder but just links. It's a terribly stupid approach, and there are many posts in the internet on this issue for Years."

That is over 120.00 per year with taxes. They need to make a better way to transfer all photos and videos at the same time to an external source. Constantly does not back up in background, only backs up while Google photos is open. Takes tremendous time to view your backed up photos and photos and videos become distorted over time. Not original quality as depicted. üò°"

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Fails to show images from Whatsapp. Also needs to stop insisting on backing up images because there's not enough room anyway. Telling the app to not back up images prompts the app to try to back up images regardless. Truly an incompetent app.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am very happy using this app. Because this app helps us a lot. This app we can keep everything like: pictures, videos, memories according to our own needs. Many thanks to the Google Photos platform."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app was fantastic until a few months ago when the UI changed. This app has become unusably slow to view any photo downloaded to the device. More than 60 gb free in storage and every other app that accesses my photo library is instant to load anything I need to view. Using the photo editor on anything saved to the device takes 2-3 minutes to load the editor. The editor is then laggy to the point of unusability. Please fix this I like the app otherwise.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Please add an option to delete some contacts suggestions when sharing a photo. The app always suggests the people you don't want to share the photo with. It's annoying.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My Google photos turned completely black and white suddenly a few hours ago. My phone's display is normal as always. And I've checked all the Android settings, I'm pretty sure there's some issue with app only. Please respond"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Overall application is good but two things need to update. First thing is Introduce folder option in Library that can help us to move few or all albums to in one folder. It is very important and useful for access photos by planning and fast. As well as second thing is pics once move to album from photos section that should be disappear in photos section. It is best for view and avoid confusion in all pics at photos section. If any issues introduce this two things kindly let us know the reason
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It was said to backup my photos. And when the app told me to free up my space in my phone storage, it confirms that the photos are all backed up and able to view it in the app, but once I freed up my space, I can no longer find the photos/videos that I want, it was deleted together in my phone and app. It happens a lot of time!! How am I able to trust this app?"

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Absolutely ridiculous that you make the Google drive integration almost a requirement for the app. I WANT TO BE ABLE TO VIEW MY PHOTOS WITHOUT GETTING TRICKED INTO USING YOUR BACKUP
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It would be nice that we can organize our pictures, camera pictures shows all pictures from other apps not just the ones taken from the camera."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Tried Google Photo print service twice but disappointed. Adjusting photobook layout to your tastes is nice and easy but this is the only positive. The result was rather dark and looked flat - no glossy option and rather expensive. Same for the individual photos prints. Plus, I ordered 200 pictures and they arrived printed in random order instead of in date order! So frustrating!"

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Stop holding my photos hostage!It shut down my camera features because my 15G cloud is full so it can't auto upload. I have 70G available on my phone but that isn't good enough for this demented system.I cleared a few gig off my google drive and google storage and STILL it says I have no space available at all. When I go onto the cloud to download pics it says I have no photo and the google photo app won't download on my laptop.I can't download them on my phone either. Give me back my photos!
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Absolute garbage, it's just so hard to find something other than images from camera and screenshot . And the gallery is a nightmare, a few of my important sd card files with the same names don't appear at all. Also it adds a disgusting sharpened filter to all of my videos. And the only good thing about this app is that, it's easier to access photos from multiple devices. I'm done, I'm switching to the ios."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Removes from local drive and really, really doesn't like giving them back. Refuses to download even one, let alone the thousands I have stored. Clunky to use. Is obsessed with albums and stories. Typical google product that does the basics badly whilst trying to get you to use features you don't want (don't get me started on youtube music or whatever it's called that replaced google music). If I could give a negative star I would, as I know at some point my photos will be lost."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible editing experience. I edit my photos and the only thing I can do is save as a copy. I have no idea where it puts it. If it's going to force me to make a copy, at least put it next to the original like Samsung or at recents. I even looked in recently added and it's not there either. I had to download a third party app to manage my photos because this is super annoying"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There should be the option to delete photos in the cloud, but Leave them on your devices. I have more than one account. I want some backed up to one, and some backed up to the other, but when I delete them off my device, I want them to remain in the cloud."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app will happily hoover up all my random screenshots and WhatsApp gifs but won't automatically backup important photos and videos I need. Certain media seems to get stuck uploading, and I've tried everything to get them unstuck, including reinstalling the app, with zero luck. Photos also occasionally remove all photos from my albums requiring me to trawl my entire library to re-add them. Makes me nervous other reviews of the app deleting photos too. Can't believe I'm paying for this service"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Two times in the last month, all the photos that I had starred as favorites on my phone were unstarred. But older photos that I had taken on other phones were still starred as favorites. Is this a sync issue of some kind? (And thanks for adding the ability, a while back, to ""favorite"" screenshots. Much appreciated)"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Profit Driven App Made Intentionally Bad. With up to 8k video common on devices you can reach a storage limit pretty quick, but the app doesn't allow you to backup photos only, and if you delete your videos, which is challenging, they just re-upload, completely ignoring your desire for them to not be on the app... a strategy designed to get you to pay for more storage."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have a constant issue getting stuff backed up... I waited days to backup multiple files & it just sits there loading making no progress. It's super trying to get a video uploaded on this app. I have good Internet so I can be sure it's an issue with either my phone or this app. I wish it uploaded quickly, to get space off my phone so I can get back to taking more videos. I'm currently stuck with full storage. After 3 days of waiting, ""free up space"" option only has 72 MB to give me, not GBs"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love the app, but here lately I have been in the process of deleting photos that I don't need anymore, & when I permanently delete them, they show right back up in my photos. I have deleted the same photos at least 10 times & they continue to show back up in my photos. This problem really needs to get fixed."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Stupid app! This is the worst image gallery app! It constantly prompts you to enable auto backup which will definitely fill your cloud storage in no time. Then it will prompt you to upgrade your storage for money. Turning backup off will still give a lot of problems! Its offline-online management is also terrible! Wanting to delete a photo in the cloud also deletes the copy in your phone storage. Worst of all, Pixel camera wont work if you disable this to use Google's much simpler Gallery app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google Photos is the best Android app for managing and sharing photos. It's easy to use, reliable, and secure. I can easily organize and edit my photos, and the app automatically creates collages, animations, and other fun creations. I also love the ability to share my photos with friends and family with just a few taps. Overall, Google Photos is the best Android app for photos, and I highly recommend it to anyone."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Back up is so slow to the point it DOESNT WORK. I've been paying for this app for 3 months with 2TB data. I had 62k pics/videos to back up. It only made it to 47k (that took 6 weeks) and now it refuses to do anymore. It is beyond slow. It clearly doesn't back up while plugged in and on wifi? Whats the issue google? I already updated, cleared cache, and did all of your basic recommendations. None of them work. Edit to add: The links you post as solutions show up as nonexistent."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,There's now a massive permanent banner across the top that tells me I need to enable notifications. It doesn't go until you enable them. I don't want notifications from a gallery app. Ever. Why would anyone? I've used this for years but if this isn't sorted I'm moving to a different app and changing my cloud storage over to a different provider.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Expandable video scroll needed. Sometimes when you need to find precise moment or frame in 10 min long video. And it's almost impossible. So it would be great to do it like on Samsung gallery or Apple Photos where you can tap on video and expand timeline for more precise seeking.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Very well built I would like it to save every photo I have on every device I log into and not share show or do anything with any photos that I don't ask or I allow and openly ask what you can do or not do before n e thing can be done with photos no hidden bs or automatic shared folder or device
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,There is no photo editing feature also not available. Only delete and share options are available. So sad. It was boring
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What happened to the locked folders? They seem to disappear and reapparr at random. Why is it not possible to organize archived or hidden pictures by folder? Samsung implemented these features like a decade ago, why is Google so far behind?"

"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Anything connected with Google is seamless to operate. I like the fact that this app allows you to print favorites as well as create hard bound albums for a low cost.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I like this app because it is easy to use and store's my photos for me and the fact that it has enough space for all my photos and they let me know when I have to back up my photo's and I can update at anytime. I also like the fact I can see other people's comments as well and they come in handy for me as well.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Would be 5 stars if Google didn't force users to pay for photo editing services. Really Google? I have to pay to enhance a photo? Aren't you a multi billion dollar corporation? Do you really need the 20$ a year for a Google one subscription cause I bet more iPhone users would be on their way to switch to Android with these services bundled with all android purchasers free the first year with the option to pay afterwards. I know I would at least lol

For example: Facebook Stickers (I didn't even know I had them!) such as 'Meep' stored deeply in the Android root directory as individual jpg files in unique folders are pulled into 'Photos.' Solution for me was to delete the stickers from Facebook then uninstall Photo's and reinstall. Today for some reason there are now some duplicate photos showing up - again apparently in the /storage on Android and some pictures I believed I had deleted. Then I discover the limitations on deleting photos. At this point the app and Google's handling of photos between this and drive seem to be 'too clever.' But maybe it's not meant for people like me who like a bit of control over their data. Looking for alternatives."

If you sync/backup your photos to Google Photos, but then stop syncing and delete photos from the app, they get deleted on your device - YES, THE ORIGINAL PHOTOS - and anywhere else they're synced.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Why every few days seems like you are continually updating this app. Is it because you're looking for a way to charge for this app?

When I deleted a few photos one by one in fullscreen, I then slid my finger down to go to the scroll page, the scroll page went ""Vzooooom"" and then stabilized. Some section of my gallery takes AGES to load. It loads like 3 photos per second.

The editable image appears long seconds after tapping edit and you mostly avoid the effort anticipating the hustle. 2.

It's ALL Pixels from the 5 and up. Please fix this, how can your main selling point be the photography when the photography is messed up and set to automatically DARKEN the photos!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This app is getting pushy with turning on backup and a lot of other stuff. it won't stop asking me. I said no when I setup the app years ago. In the last few months it's now asking me about ever week or less. If I said no I mean no. It's like it's waiting for me to hit yes my mistake one day when it pops up... Also with all the Google app icons almost looking the same I keep opening the wrong apps from time to time.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Worked great until about a week ago when it started experiencing constant crashes while browsing, and trying to use the editor crashes the app entirely.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Google photos is a very generic photo app. It allows me to see the photos I took in 1 place, which is great. Unfortunately, the app will always and constantly ask you if you want to use its other features. Everytime you open the app, for instance, it will ask if you want to back up your photos. If you say no, it then asks if instead of all your photos, should it back up a random selection of photos. I do not want to back up my photos. If I did, I would have done so already. Stop asking."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Can't upload any photos anywhere Due to it being the only photos app installed on the pixel it's all I have but it doesn't store the pictures on the phone so you can't access any of them on any other app on the phone. Facebook? Nope only a handful of random images that make so sense. Instagram? Same story and even in messages like texting and something as simple as adding a picture to contacts I can't do because of how poorly thought out this app is and the phone it's installed on.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"TikTok downloads videos into the DCIM camera folder - the same folder that the default Camera app saves your own photos/videos in. It's an absurd choice by TikTok to store downloaded videos in your camera folder. And since I have Google Photos automatically back up all my Camera photos/videos, it ends up backing up TikTok videos as well. TikTok doesn't allow changing its default folder to save downloaded files in. And Google Photos doesn't allow not syncing the default camera folder."

I was scrolling through Photos attempting to rectify the 15 GB storage limit issue and upon doing so, it started deleting albums and I couldn't stop the process. I'm very upset about this.

But this last update from October 26, 2023 was pointless honestly. Google files already does what they claim the update has added. And 8 don't think any phone when Android 10 n up don't have the g files app preinstalled now, replacing the old files/file manager/file explorer apps from the phone's manufacturer."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app is really changed a lot doesn't allow you to edit zoom in like I used to be able to I don't like it I don't know what the developers are doing but they need to get it fixed.

But all the photos are all shown out of the folders so I can't just click on the folder I want without searching for it. The pictures app on my Samsung Galaxy was far better.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Google photos makes it impossible to do basic things with their backups. If you ""free up space"" through the app it deletes all of the pictures from your phone so they are only accessible through Google photos. And it is impossible to download photos to your phone in bulk. Also it is impossible to delete photos from just Google photos, it will delete them from all syched devices. This is just a scam to get you to spend money on additional storage space when your phone already has way more storage"

I keep deleting useless items so that I can access the useful content easily. But the deleted items reappear like always. It seems Google deliberately wants the items not to be deleted so that the free quota gets filled up and one is forced to buy their extra storage. Great selling technique!

Using the app in landscape mode squishes the photos but makes the menues take up 50% of the screen space (absolutely horrible).

"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Great app but can you give iption to shut music off in your samples. Could turn in if samples a keeper....need to correct deleted options in Google photo app. I hear issues that when you delete photo on phone it also deleted photo's in Google cloud. The link you sent me doesn't work. Please send functional links. This has happened with other issues ive notified you about
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's great unless you need to use it for anything useful, then you realize how restricted it's feature set is. So I have a Tensor core, editing all happens locally, but I cannot use the Magic Editor without enabling backups i.e. paying for Google One. Sooooooo the pixel 8 pro is just as good as my pixel 5."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"10/14/23 Perhaps it was after the Android 14 update, but Google photos has completely misaligned the dates of the photos. The dates listed as I scroll are all off by a few days from the info on the actual picture. No real pattern. Tried force stop, clearing cache and restarting phone, but Photos app continues to scroll on it's own. I open, use the side slider to scroll to a date, and then the app continues scrolls down a few pictures at a time, completely on it's own. Pixel 5"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I take pictures that I do not necessarily want to keep (pictures of a part I need to get from hardware store, etc.). However, when I delete from google photos it automatically deletes from my phone and I cannot find how to stop this action. So, I have tons of pictures stored, which are useless (but I need to keep on my phone. Very frustrating, to say the least. When I look up how to delete from cloud but keep on device the directions are useless"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So, since the latest update I can no longer edit my photos. When I click on edit option, it blinks then goes right back to the album. I have verified that my phone is current on updates and rebooted multiple times. I'm gonna uninstall and then reinstall the app to see if that works"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I am not paying and you can't make me. Backing up only certain folders is a massive pain and when backup is disabled it takes forever for some images to show up. I'd expect something more seamless from Google. The only part of this app I use anymore is image editing and some of the features there are paywalled too.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best app I've ever used, besides snapchat. I like that the storage space is almost practically unlimited, I have 15+ years worth of photos and videos and have never had any issues with storage or anything. Wish they had a few more editing options, but Its good enough for me."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Update: I finally found the app on my own. The advise support gave me, did not help. It has completely taken the app off my phone. I can't access my photos, only through my camera or go to the play store and open the app they're. The app on my home screen is just gone. Along with my extra Google apps. None of them are on my home screen."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Update of 18-OCT-2023 lost stability on my Android 8.0 device. A bad update, with issues yet unaddressed. Like most others, I can't change my OS on my Smartphone, so ANY updates on the photos app must be properly compatible, and NOT be fixing things that aren't broken! After doing the ""uninstall"" (from the Play store, of all things...) The older rev worked fine. I don't know what all may be messed up on the revs of early OCT/23, because the app just wouldn't open on my Blackview 9800Pro w A 8.0"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love it, great place to keep your pictures AND it has a locked folder for pictures that you don't want anyone else to see. I love that it gives you notifications so you remember to back up your pictures and how it shows you memories from the previous year. Best photo app I've used."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"My experience with Google staff in assisting me is excellent. However I'm still moving slow since it's the first experience I have had; in the technical system. My in put is simply to enhance the purpose of connections through the arts; both in verses, and poems. I have great appreciation for all staff of Google. They are the teachers and protectors of the arts. I must say starting with Google in the beginning; they were the protectors from unlawfull beings on line.Thus I have respect in trust."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have to say that this app has brought me more joy than any other app I have ever had period. The best part to me is the daily memory reels dedicated to either a day or a person out of my thousands of stores photos. I can't Tell you how many times I was having a seemingly hopeless day struggling to find reasons to keep grinding. Then photos notify me asking if I remember this day with pics of loved ones and the day suddenly is much brighter!!!!
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Really love photo sync feature, but I don't like 2 things: 1) You can't sync only photos, blocking videos. It's very bad, because videos need much more storage than photos and free 15GB quote will fill up very fast by 2-3 long videos. 2) Very bad storage management. Google Photos tries to hide from you, where is photo: on phone or in cloud, so you can't delete it ONLY from cloud (it deletes local file automatically)or view variants from different storages to compare and choose what to save.Bad:("

You have to be careful too if share with someone they could gain access to your whole account location and all. I was the victim of a stalker who gain access for years. It's very frustrating using photos files Gmail it's all frustrating to use."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"insanely TERRIBLE ux design. Once you ""backup"" pics they're no longer organized in folders like the camera folder, and instead mixed with all photos including screenshots and downloads into one folder. Also because of this ""feature"" other apps cant find pics that are backed up and instead only show what's on your phone."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why is download images removed? I'll just stop using Google Photos if it's that unsuable. Sometimes, I have to download and upload photos in a document / social media site. I understand the logic behind ecosystem gating but you're just asking me to take a screenshot and crop it to upload. Pretty bad UX. I've lost trust in your intentions to do good for users. Edit: Replying. I see an option to delete from device. I don't want to delete. I want to download it again."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"What a poor excuse for a photo browser. It has all the bells and whistles except the basics. Finding downloaded photos takes way too long. And in what's typical of Google, it nags you every day to back up your photos even if you've got better ways to do it. Looking for an alternative."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is trying to piss me off, obviously. I want you to stop analysing the content of my photos as I pay for the service. I also want to remove all EXIF data, including the location. I don't want you tracking me. I'm now getting a message at the top demanding that I turn on notifications. NO!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Photos deleted videos/photos from my SD card, from folders that I explicitly said backup ""off"". I assumed that if I exclude some folder, the application would keep out. In order to free up space, I copy (not moved to prevent open files and used inodes) videos from some folder in SD card to excluded folder. By deleting files on app, due to ""bin full"" the files would be deleted. Well, all copies of videos on DCIM and out of DCIM, and on app were deleted. Why? Enough of this ""evil"" approach."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Once I activated the app on my phone I couldn't edit my final paper because my Google cloud storage was full. So I deleted all of my photos thinking I was just removing them from the cloud but as it turns out it deletes them from your phone also. And if you clear your trash there's absolutely no way to get them back. So years of photos, documents and memories are all gone now because of one mistake and a app with no failsafe."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I updated my Google photos. When I open it all the photos and videos shows like black photos. When I want to play a video it's not play . A circle rounding on videos. I can't see all the photos. It's happening after update. üò≠ Please help me as soon a possible.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Keeps crashing - can't do much. Thinking of switching as I'm paying for storage of this app and it's totally not worth it. The crashing is happening with all Google apps. It's woeful üòû I need a new phone and was seriously considering pixel but the apps performance are so poor I'm inclined to just buy an iPhone
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Still not backing up. Also the layout of this all is just awful. I just want simple folders but it does not give any options. I ha e always hated this app. And since it's not even backing up. I just deleted it and already found an app 100% better. It's crazy how long I put with a trash app. I should have done this day one.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I wish that when I downloaded an image it was saved to a download folder or at least give me an option to download it to any album I've made instead of having to manually move images to the album I want. It's really hard to find images through apps when uploading them elsewhere or even changing my phone's wallpaper because I have to dig through all of my photos unless I manually add them to another album. I know I could just do this but I've used other galleries that automatically do this.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Update 10/18/2023 app storage is now 9.4 GB. Every day people just add more photos to their library. Without some limits in the app, just getting fatter! 9/13/2022 User data for this app is now over 7.5 GB!! I understand the iPhone version has a option to limit the cache size of this app. The android version just grows and grows. If you delete it, it will just grow back. I don't want or need a thumbnail stored on my phone of all my Google photos. Please add a setting to limit the cache size!!!"

Upgrade to Pixel 8 for this very reason, I'm planning to return the handset."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very convoluted to use. Google photos says my album is backed up, however when ever I delete from my device's gallery, it deletes from google photos. If I delete a photo from my backed album on google photos, deletes from my device gallery. Google photos won't display all my albums on my device to upload, only a select fee are avaible in the app. Changing to one drive."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The app crashes when I try to edit a picture. I have deleted cache and reinstalled. It appears to work briefly but no tools menu.

Great job guys üëçüëçüëç Since the newest Android update I have to confirm and reconfirm every change I make with this app due to the new storage permission system. It's extremely annoying and Google should do something about it.

If you view albums in landscape you get black bars at the top and bottom of the screen obscuring your photos (pixel 8). There's some advanced stuff but mostly it feels too basic for organising.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Absolutely terrible design. Why would I want to automatically delete photos from device when deleting from the app. No matter if sync is on or off?

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,What is the point of having all my photos individually backed up if Google photos does not upload all my organized photo albums in my phones gallery. I was about to do the option to clear my phone internal storage based on photos that are backed up to Google photos but then I realized that I would have to manually create and organize all my folders again if I do that and I will not spend time doing that for years worth of photos.

I will just have to upload my photos manually with google drive, pretty cumbersome with all the seperate apps, google one, drive, photos.They should make one single app to access all"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It gets worse the older it gets and the more ""updates"" they add aren't beneficial either. It was better the original way when all your editing and functions were in the photo app itself and took up way less storage which ruins the clarity and video replay when transferring dats through different platforms. It sucks now."

The indian paid interns working on the app for Tim/Greg or their twin good bois is asking that instead you take a screenshot of each individual conversation after you have it. and then let the trickhoe back that up jumbled up. You know - as opposed to just not hacking your device at all.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Thanks for providing backup to locked photos. I am really glad you heard the feedback which I have provided earlier. I have increased my feedback to 4 stars. I haven't given 5 stars because I still think locked feature can be improved further. Please allow us an option to set custom pin also instead of just use lock screen setting. Sometimes our family knows the screen lock and have fingerprint added so this locked folder will lack the security. I will be really looking forward to it. Thanks

"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,They lost a number of photos that can never be replaced. Going against all they say. I can definitely say it does seem to have improved. I feel somewhat responsible because of the amount of photos that I had not catalogued very well. I just always relied on the system doing all the work for me. I need to take a more proactive role in how my photos and videos are preserved. Thank you for listening. This has gone a long way to mend a bridge I was willing to burn.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Would be a great app if they removed the music. Every memory photo has elevator music, including over any video that has sound. You can't hear the original very well and the photo slides have the annoying music too. Can't turn it off."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The memories feature is absolutely stupid. It selects pics seemingly at random. So I'm regularly having pseudo-nostalgic reals of receipts or parking spots come up. We should be able to turn this feature off. I didn't ask for it and don't want it. I hate my life and shouldnt be forced to have this feature at the top of the app.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,be warned: this app is shoddy at best when it comes to keeping your videos and photos secure and will seemingly corrupt any photo or video at random as it seems fit. it corrupted a 30 min video i worked forever on out of nowhere and made it impossible for me to recover it. also really neat that i have to pay PER ACCOUNT to increase storage. terrible app.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,overall it's not a bad app at all and I do like it. Definitely allows you to organize and pair your pictures with faces recognition. it offers a lot of options to pick from as well to edit. so overall I think it's it's pretty good nice clear pictures.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"tapped on the ""Free up Space"" option, right above the ""your data in Google photos"" one. Before pressing it, I didn't really understand the concept of it. So I blindly gave it permission to ""modify"" my gallery. When it said ""modify"", I didn't know it meant outright deleting my pictures from my phone gallery and transferring It to Google photos!? Please, if there is a way to undo this, help me. Or give me the best solution to restore it back to the way it was before."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Terrible. I couldn't transition my 8K photos and videos on this phone because it takes space on my Google account cloud and I'll be forced to pay for cloud storage to use that feature. I took my Google account off the photos app and now I can even use my edit and I can not upload any of my thousands of photos that I have on my PC to my phone. I also hate the photo user interface it would be much better if they have a gallery interface that way I can see all my photos and videos altogether.

Hands down the worst thing to happen in phone photography so far, considering returning the phone. Google please give us the option to TURN ULTRA HDR OFF"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Worst app ever. No control over the unstoppable backup to the cloud. Then the app informs me I am running out of storage. No idea what this app is supposed to do! No instructions of any sort. I only got it because my wife wanted to share an album from gallery and it doesn't even seem capable of that.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"All is well, until the app uses data very suddenly to backup the photos at crucial time.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The option to create an invitation link using which a person could only see the photos after joining the album and not without it has been removed.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best app to store photos, and view them anywhere if you know your email and it's password. It let you store up to 15GB of files, and with very cool features like face identification, creating Throwbacks of your memories, etc. I have a good idea to make google photos more secure, add tow step verification to google photos, As by chance any scammer gets to know about email and it's password.

Please stop. I know and I realize that you want me to give you money and I need you to realize that I don't have it to give. The app seriously needs an option to dismiss excess unnecessary notifications. It's out of hand.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It keeps crashing. I already talked to the customer service and followed also the article online but nothing happens really. Still the same s***. Since the last update it keeps crashing. It is very annoying to uninstall and install again the app everytime I need to delete a photo.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love this app! It automatically saves any pictures that you take with your phone and catagorizes them perfectly! It also offers plenty of FREE space to store them and more than enough features to keep you as obsessed with it as I am!

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,On the Pixel fold when I go to edit video it takes forever to load and I get a circle spinning in the center I actually have to restart the phone to actually use the app. How about instead of using your own slow processor you use something like I don't know Qualcomm and call it a day so we can actually use the phone that we bought properly thanks and I don't want to go and read any articles about how to fix anything.

We would not need additional camera apps loaded."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love this app because it stores so many photos and helps u delete unwanted photos that are taking up space on your devices. I only wish it would help locate and delete multiple photos. If u send a photo thru an app and you have that app being backed up to Google photos that photo will then be located in two locations.

While adding images from phone to an album even the deleted images are shown. Otherwise a good app which gets the job done. But could be much much better if basic design issues are rectified.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The picture back up feature also back up videos. One mobile data we have the option not to back up video but not on WiFi. That cause huge wifi usage (not all wifi unlimited still) and waste google drive storage most of the time. Why don't you bring back the option to buy safe video like before?
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've used Google photos for years (like 20 I think, since their inception) I love this app. I'm sure part of it is familiarity however I find it easy to use for albums, sending photos, making photo books, and finding out where a photo was taken."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,So trash. What is the point of backing them up if you can only download photos onto a new phone one photo at a time and it is too much effort downloading them to even bother. Why not have an option to back-up all photos or selected albums to your phone?? Or is Google just there to spy on you??

Horrible for when I need to edit a video or find it later. Also? For the last year there has been another glitch where more than half the times I edit a photo, I can't save it. And if I do? It shows me an ""error"" message. Have I updated the app? Yes. Have I uninstalled and reinstalled? Yes. Months for this? Yes."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm quite unhappy with this app üòê. For example, when you want replace or add music üé∂ to your single video, then you will need to upload your original video to the cloud, then add a music and save it. That step will however create a new one (edited) video which you need to download to your device to be able to use it ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. So even such a banality needs cloud and lots of transferred data. Also the multi-video editing experience is terrible üôÑ. Google is definitely not a leader in this."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It a little bit good but always need to switch data to get clear photo or video. Sometimes, downloading backuped videos is very irritating, you may use all your data bundle to get just a partial video. I think, this should be done well."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,As of right now I give it a three because when you run out of space for how ever much photos you have. Everytime you go to watch one of your videos there's a message saying you have no space blocking the part where you scroll threw the video and no I can't do that.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Photos have been ruined by interference of the app taking over my photos . And even writing on them organizing them . Making them hard to get to . And all kinds of annoying suggestions and pointers. I jest wanna look at my photos without all this unhelpful aggravating direction.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I made the mistake of trusting google Backup. I'm super frustrated. Not everything is copied as expected. I lost a lot. I trusted Google so much that I freed up space on my galaxy s23 ultra and now I can't use my Samsung gallery because I don't have anything. Some folders that I miss are also not reflected in Google Photo
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Photos are backing up in original quality even when storage saver is selected. Also i cannot change the backed up photos to storage saver using web. The app is pretty much useless edit: i found the reason. only photos taken with the device uploading those photos can be converted to storage saver.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Bad app, bad experience, i can't stop app from uploading videos, i want just to upload pictures just pictures üò° OneDrive of Microsoft is the best App because i can stop upload videos from All folders by one click and just upload pictures.

I don't Have to worry about losing any pictures of my memories From the past Now that I'm getting older. I look through them and I Get glad. Google Photos makes my day. So yes, I recommend this to everybody It's better Then the other apps. Because All they do is cancel and Erase all your pictures. And you lose everything with this one they save it for you. Until you decide to Eliminate them"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Best app on the market. There just needs to be a different password for the locked folder instead of the device screen lock password or the option to use only finger or face to unlock. Everything else is fine.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I do love this app when I don't forget about the Google apps account's; because you can go in your account by your password and the other thing like getting a password seen to your phone that is at the end of finishing setting up your account with the number one account the ask you to built to be at use in Google play store and this is probably the only way that you actually can get app or upgrade your app to get them going with almost all of them you will need a Email and that get you a Drive;

"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Still no way to create nested albums, poor sorting & organising options and laggy performance makes it hard to justify why I'm paying for this. A ton of people use this app, you'd expect that there'd be more development to improve the product but it's been stagnant for the longest time unfortunately. Ps, not sure how these developer auto-replies are meant to help, they don't address any of these issues."

It causes terrible workflow issues for posting on social media platforms, it's a nightmare for pixel users."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Latest update on the Pixel 8pro groups RAW photos together and not in a separate folder. This means your cloud storage is taken up a lot quicker.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tired of the little paper cuts. Getting some other app, maybe leafpic or just use Solid Explorer The latest thing is that it likes to pop up telling you updates are available. I don't care. Google Play store is in charge of that, don't grab my attention to tell me that. Quit with the popups and other visual noise. You can update the app anytime, why do you need to nag me about that? I feel like the sadists of YouTube's UX team or Play Store's UX dementors must have input on this app, too."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Everything on that app is automatic and happening behind the scenes. The user has absolutely zero control over even choosing what they want to back up - the user cannot even see what photos are associated with their account. The only two options are ""sync on"", in which case all your photos are synced (even the ones you don't really want to sync), and ""sync off"", in which case, absolutely nothing changes in the app. No matter what sync setting you use, you will never have any idea about anything."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall, excellent. Organises all photos by date and location, and creates videos, albums, and stylised photos for you. Also cleverly gives you the option of fixing lighting on some photos. I do wish, though, that ALL automatic creations were available to view on the app assistant page, not just the most recent ones. Also, be warned: despite what it says, you seemingly CANNOT undo changes after they have been made, and once you've chosen to not make suggested changes, the option won't reappear."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,To boil plate this issue. This app has taken over or allowed other people to take over my phone on multiple occasions when I am using the phone. The control becomes theirs and it scrolls through all the menu options and you can't STOP it and sometimes you can't even turn it off. It looks like the phone is a wild rollercoaster out of control!!!! It or people change permission settings too. Work on security here and overall. At 6:21pm tonight it did it again. Any information?

"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I would give the editing features in this app 5 stars except that when I save a copy of my edited photo it converts the timestamp to my time zone. Example: The original photo was taken on 11/13/23 at 8:20 pm in Tourmina Sicily. When I edited it from the USA in Wisconsin days later, the copy now stored the timestamp as 11/13/23 1:20 pm, the equivalent time is my locale. That changes the order of my photos and forces me to go back and edit the time manually. Not efficient use of my time. Fix pls"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Worse with every update. Actually went back to earliest version on phone for a breath of fresh air. But they throw a prompt in your face to update every single time you open the app. Too many options trying to sell you stuff. Don't use backup? Too bad, half of the infrastructure and screen is still dedicated to it. You can't just zoom out on the grid and have everything clustered (Photos must organise by day, week or month). Can't order."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Should not have problems with Google messages app and photos combined. Photos always has problems with crashing and not uploading, problematic. And messages won't let you send high res or mb files without a link. Ridiculous way to force people to use the drive.. and side note because there's a huge flaw and oversight with photos is there's no option in the settings to allow it to use data instead of prefer Wi-Fi which is seems to make its own decisions on that one."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This used to be the best, now I'm looking for another app. I used to create folders and move photos between them. All folders were available offline. Now I cannot create folders, or move photos into existing ones. Now there are only albums that insist on duplicates. The original photo stays in the camera roll and if you delete it from there it goes from the album also. So albums are totally pointless. So looking for a new app to replace this one."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"For some time now my photos esecially the ones I download just randomly disappear, its really annoying as a lot of photos have been lost this way. I figured if I simply copy the photos in multiple folders I can save most but that doesn't downplay the fact that the app is randomly deleting my pictures. Also, my locked folder is gone, all the pictures along with it, is this a bug, a malfunction, I don't know but it is not good and I am annoyed."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Perfect. Still have pictures from when I was a kid, and the only issue I've had is with the backup; you have to go on the app for it to back up, rather than it doing it in the background but thats just a nitpick. The image search works really well, too. You also have to pay monthly for storage and in their defense it isnt much, but id still just rather buy it as a one-time payment. As a result, I've never bought any extra storage. That's what gets it 4 stars. Otherwise, perfect"

The search feature is nice, but rarely finds what I'm looking for. A ""recently uploaded"" feature would most certainly be nice as well. It's very irritating uploading photos from a PC and having to scroll for hours on my phone to find the photos (because the search feature is almost useless). Also, please! I repeat, please! Change the ""free up space feature""! Nothing aggravates me more than hitting a wrong button and deleting all the photos off my device. No permissions (like are you sure you want to do this? And explanation of what it does). No way to stop it. Just stare at your screen in horror as your photos get deleted off your phone with no way to stop it. Scramble to force close the app, but too late! Gone! Back to the abyss of Google photos to try to find your photos.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Somehow simple and confusing. It's been impossible to watch videos on the ap. Especially on computer. Buffering for ages, seconds, minutes. Editing a series of pictures takes ages because of the delay in switching images. Assigning to folders can take over 20s per image. Archiving makes the app freeze. It's very very bad if you want to process a large volume of images."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The latest update has ruined the app. I'm a tattooist so rely heavily on my phone for taking pics but with the new update the photos keep self brightening or going really dull when scrolling through so I can never tell what the photo ACTUALLY looks like. I've had to delete all the updates on the app and it works like it used to again. Shared albums are now a tiny tab at the top and for some bizarre reason photos are arranged oldest first so you have to scroll to the bottom to see new pics ü´†

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Google steals your data! There's absolutely no reason our photo album should ever be connected to the Internet unless we specifically turn on back up. It's a huge violation of privacy if Android users photos are visible to anyone other than the owner and who the owner chooses to share with.

Now I have to go click on memories and create them myself. Google photos has gotten lazy and forced me to do what it originally did in the first place. I'm ready to dump Google photos and buy a Nikon at least I won't lose over 3/4 million pictures because Google photos people were to lazy to help me save what I had accumulated. Value pics?

Now you have to pay for storage. But my gripe is I have a pixel 7 pro and I am forced to use Google photos as my gallery app. It was already one star for turning free into paid. Now I'm giving you negative five stars for forcing pixel users to use google photos as gallery app. I will most definitely be going back to galaxy phones. Never to touch a pixel again

I've had Google photos for decades and this change was very unwelcome. My Google storage is a finite resource and I'd like to delete things without deleting them from my phone.

You have to hand-select photos or videos to add, so if your library is large, it's cumbersome and very frustrating when lost. Secondly, while scrolling through main library of photos on my phone, I like to put them into folders. The folders are ordered chronologically instead of alphabetically, so if you have more than 50+ folders, it's tedious to find the one you want."

Grateful for the storage space that allows me to remove things off my phone, but the folders and moving things around can be a bit complicated, as you cannot rearrange within the app. Edit: Photos edited with Magic Eraser have been saving w/ visual corruptions as of late, and there is still no flip image option."

Why oh why, can we not download Albums for offline viewing on mobile devices? Its silly that Google can pick out my dogs face out of thousands of pictures, but can't save an album to the device for offline viewing. Speaking of picking my dog out of my pictures, I have had this app for years, and an account as well, and the People and Pets section is still only People. Please fix! So far those are the only issues I can say about it. So many good things though. Removing photos from the device after confirming they are on the cloud, in order to free up space on the device. Picking my dog out of thousands of photo's is very impressive, even if I have to search for animals instead my dogs name. And last but not least, the assistant, puts together nice collages, memory videos, and automatic albums based on location and time periods. Well made, with many convenient features. However still lacking a few important ones."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I thought this was just Google's version of Samsung's Gallery app. But it's nothing like it. It let's you organize all your photos in a very intuitive way. It even recognizes people, things, pets and places in all your photos automatically and learns how to classify them. The assistant will ocassionally create things like collages, panoramas, short movies, stylized photos, etc. It's great. Highly recommended if you love to have your photo gallery organized."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I'm upset I found out the hard way pictures aren't saved on my phone when deleting them in the app to free up storage space. I deleted a ton of memories thinking those pictures would still be on my phone even though I deleted them from the cloud. I assumed my phone storage would act like a hard drive and that I would have to manually delete files I didn't want. Now I can't get those memories back. Rightfully those files shouldn't be removed from my device.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Doubtlessly good app but 15 GB space is not enough for storing all the photos. This has to upgrade it's free space atleast upto 30 GB. This will be more helpful than other new features.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,So when I first got this app I just thought I would be useless. But now that I have downloaded it the app has brought back all of my lost photos that I had from factory reset. This now has brought me to five stars after I used all of the extra features with the app.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Dude who ever thought of ""free up space"" is so stupid. It's transferred all of the photo into backup data. But wait, it just scattered all over so essentially you just gotta find the photo/video from top to bottom. There's zero warning about your photo/video gonna get deleted. And now you can't download all photo/video that have been backup. So you just gotta download all of them one by one. It's just a mess. Please there's an update where you just undo/download all the data you've been backup"

The photos are sometimes not arranged in a chronological manner and pictures taken a day ago get mixed up with pics from today. That or pictures are not arranged in the order in which they were taken. Not sure if it's a bug or something, this never happened before. Tried closing down app, clearing cache, nothing worked."

Initially Google Photos was free now after certain amount of storage the start monthly or yearly charges which is not acceptable
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I'll give it a three because it's consistently asking for updates even when you were from updating recently

"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent app! I love how it creates animations, videos and collections on its own. I did a home project recently over the span of a couple weeks taking periodic pictures of the progress. A few days after the project was completed, I received a slideshow which pulled out only the pictures of the project. Awesome feature! It also creates then & now pictures if my kids and pulls together albums like ""best of summer 2018"" which are typically the pictures I would have chosen to pull into an album as well. To get a printed photo album out of the app is also possible, but pretty expensive. Overall, one of my favorite apps... although recently the automatic assistant creations have slowed in their frequency. Hopefully this feature improves as I do look forward to seeing what the app pulls together. It's both amazing and a little creepy at how well it does."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The backup photo popup keeps showing up and won't let me leave the screen and look through my photos and when I click don't upload. It just loads forever non stop and does nothing.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Please change the automatic delete from device if you delete on Google, I've lost many photos this way. Especially when it doesn't do the other way around which is how most would want it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Fantastic app apart from one glitch. I scanned in all my family photos and edited them and all the dates have swapped and they are all out of place and have lost their original dates. If you try and rectify, they move somewhere else. Flagged it up with Google and got ignored as did countless other people. I think it is still broken. I have given up. For all other photos, editing, sharing, uploading is all amazing...I love it... simple to use and edit."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm impressed with this app! The features are easy to understand and use. I'm always rather surprised by the beauty of the suggested filters and ""stylized photos"" that the app generates. You can also go in and make specific adjustments to minute details like contrast, light, exposure, shadow, and saturation, so I can always get just the picture I'm looking for. I also appreciate the automatic albums it creates! Recently switched from using my phone's photo manager to this one, as Google photos seems to know much more about what I need."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"For some reason it always seems really hard to find important photos, but the ones I keep deleting always seem to keep hanging around. And there's too much stupid fluff. This app is way more complicated and difficult to use than it needs to be!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Everytime am update occurs I be loosing photo memories. Why is that?
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"For what ever reason my phone decided to remove like 60% of my images, camera, downloads, screenshots etc. Off my local storage, I was loosing my kind as you can imagine until I found out Google photos has saved all of those deleted! Great! But I cannot find a single way to simply re sync or download all my photos back onto my phone without doing them one by one, but that resets the metadata on the images. This should be such a simple basic thing to have on it but it's not there."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I can live with this app, gotten used to it. However I was trying out the Movie function using Assistant and it seems like I have to upload my video (to where?!?) before it lets me so anything to it. I thought this is supposed to be a native function, no uploads required. On top of that, it doesn't even upload my videos. It just says Uploading and the progress bar doesn't even move."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Exceptional platform for photo and video storage. I have a few nitpicks, which is when I have downloaded videos on my phone, it automatically shows up in Google Photos. Also, the virtual photo viewer is not available in Google Photos but only in my pre-installed ""Gallery"" app. Maybe it's got to do with the configurations, but I'm also redirected to my ""Gallery"" app after taking photos instead of Google Photos. Regardless it is a powerful app that will see to much use and I highly recommend."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"On the Photo tab, please allow one to see which photos have been backed up or not (maybe with some icon indicator) so that one can manually select those non-backed up photos to be backed up. Better still, have a sort function for this. These are quite basic and I would have thought these functions would have been baked into the app by now!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really great App, is lacking a few features for me personally: - ""available offline"" function like in Google Drive, Docs, Sheets... - The ability to have more pictures suggested for Archiving, as far as I know you have to wait for the ""Assistant"" to suggest moving a few pictures to the archive - The ability to pick a standard photo editor directly and not having to wait for the build in one to load before choosing a different one - Better zoom implementation, (bug: Zoom resettes after touch)"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I like how it makes photos and videos accessible from all my devices but it often takes hours to get it to backup to the cloud from my phone. I am unable to find a ""backup now"" button anywhere. Signing out and back in doesn't seem to help, nor does restarting my android. Usually I just give up and then see them in the cloud a week later. Long since I needed them. If the backup actually worked I'd give it 5 stars but it's terrible for sharing and Google doesn't care how buggy any of their software is. Looking for a replacement even if I have to pay for it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,No way to get longer videos (5min+) off this stupid app. Can't edit in app because error message 'Device storage full' pops up even though my device has more than enough memory. Sharing to other apps flat-out doesn't work. Downloading to device either is 'unsuccessful' or downloads as .mov automatically which most phones can't do anything with because it doesn't put it in your gallery. I want to share and edit my videos! This has been going on for years. FIX IT.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"there are so many things I love about this app. It makes it easier to access old photos I no longer have on my phone. It also provides frequent reminders of happy past moments , create collages and edits photos with a nice touch. But my favorite part about it, is the fact it recognizes faces and groups the pictures of each individual together. You can even name the face and the next time you type their name in search bar, you will get all of the pictures they appear in. Simply brilliant!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love the unlimited photo storage and the easy of syncing photos to the cloud. It's pretty good at searching faces and for other broad topics, but surprisingly bad at searching via photo descriptions. The assistant does a pretty good job, but I wish there was more user control to stylize photos, order collages, sequence animations, etc. Overall very good, but missing great elements."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Something that really annoys me about this app is that it doesn't recognize albums you make. When I wanted to email a professor images from an album I made, it only showed me the screenshot, Snapchat, Line, Messenger, and other automatically made albums. I had to scroll through hundreds of my pictures to select each individual one (20 in total. I had to remember the dates of each image just to help me scroll down to it faster). I ran into the same problem when I was adding pictures to Google slides. I have to search through hundreds of images just to find the exact one I'm looking for (even though they are all collected in an album I made). It seems like the app is made for those who own only 100 images. My iPad that's 5 years old will let me see the albums I made and upload the entire album (or select from within the Album) into Google apps (drive, Gmail, slides...) Yet this one can't recognize albums despite also being a Google app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's a nightmare. Using the backup feature was a mistake. Instead of creating copies, it moved all my photos from my phone's gallery to Google Photos. Now, there seems to be no way to get them back into my phone gallery. I am annoyed and irritated at the same time. The app is a user experience failure. Update: I am not able to move my photos back to my phone gallery. They were originally on my phone, but disappeared after enabling 'backup' on Google Photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,App was not opening the people section in it. Like only a specific person was not opening. Whenever I was opening that person the app crashed. I restarted my phone also. Then I decided to uninstall and reinstall the app. But not its only even reinstalling. Gets stuck at a percentage. Like at 82 or 89. Tried several times with both wifi and mobile data. And my net is working fast enough.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Updates itself regularly without my permission, even though I've turned off auto-update. No other google app does this. It's becoming creepy, how whenever I connect to any network, it just shows a notification that this app is once again updating. I've tried disabling this app before, multiple times, and it always manages to claw its way out of that restriction and start automatically updating without notice or permission again."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The annoying aspects of this app are too numerous to list, so I'm going to just touch upon the most recent and thus far most irritating one. It keeps telling me to update, so I hit the update link and it brings me to the app store. It says it's already installed but I click on it anyway thinking I need to do something to get it to stop telling me to update! I go though all the steps and nothing happens! It still tells me to update every time I click on my photos app to do anything and if I try it again, in the vain Hope's thst whatever is wrong has been fixed by now, it puts me through the same ridiculous scenario. What the heck? It's like the app's developed the technological equivalent of dementia!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app has plenty of cool features and in general once could say it's a great replacement of the default ""Gallery"" on the phone. It fails though in one place: you cannot sync ONLY photos. Inability to deselect video from syncing (even for a paying user) is unfortunately a deal breaker (the option was there before). It's easy to do selective sync - so this feature is not there willingly. @ANSWER TO GOOGLE: automatic photo sync WITHOUT video is the feature I'm missing! Your answer helps nothing."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Fine but some UI elements are silly such as ... 1. displaying loading circle over low res preview photo while high res photo loads in the background...whats the point of loading the hd photo in the background if you put a circle over the preview?? 2. fix lighting prompt. no, i don't want to fix lighting on every. single. photo. let me switch this stupid thing off please. Otherwise quite good but why do Google products in general get worse? Take me back to the Golden age..."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Everytime I open this app after a while, it does a random back up of random photo maps I never even heard off. Then I open my picture galary from samsung, and I have randomly installed over 400 (!) pictures/stickers Inever made or downloaded. Those pictures are spread over different days. It is really weird and, other than that, I have no problem with google photos, I absolutely love it. But please fix thus bug/problem/whatever. IF THIS PROBLEM IS CAUSED BY ME, PLEASE TELL ME AND HOW TO FIX IT!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great, flawless application for your mobile device that provides the most accurate, and frankly terrifying album suggestions. Not in a bad sensed by any means, but definitely makes you wonder how the app done can distinguish between two, two-month old black fuzzball kittens....it's truly a work of art (the coding behind what the average consumer doesn't even know is there, only running in the background and with extreme efficiency!) Keep it up guys! Solid programming!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used to love this app. I could count on it to save all my photos and it gave me comfort knowing if something unexpected ever happened to my phone, I could always find my pictures again. But I upgraded to a new phone recently, and now this app is not working. It gets stuck when backing up my photos. It'll show me it has 44 photos to back up, and hours later, I go back to the app and it will still show the same 44 photos backing up. I'm very disappointed with this and I hope it gets fixed soon."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very nice to be able to take videos from work and it being so easy to navigate I just pretty much hit a button and it does the rest for me. Then when I get home I can simply push another button and see what I did at work and show my Boss instead of trying to explain or it's invaluable as a fact finder because I work in a very high volume automotive and tire shop and if customers come in with prior damage to vehicle or their rims I just snap a photo or take a video of the damage prior 2 the work.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Can't switch off video autoplay; whoever thought this was a good idea? That person should be sacked. Yes, you can disable it in the grid view, but try scrolling through your photos in a quiet place and next thing it blares out at top volume. Woke my partner up the other night as I was trying to post stuff onto social media. Taking these basics of control away from users is a sure way to drive them away. I'm off, and downloading an alternative. Used to like it. No longer."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It allows you to store all your photos in one place and create folders, which you choose to name and then make into albums. You can choose from several styles of filter, that can highlight or lowlight your photo giving you the option of saving it, but in several styles. You can also crop them to your desired size. This ease of storage is a bonus as you can free up space on your phone. I really like this app and enjoy using my photos in various different ways. Would recommend it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I can't find some of my photos. I look everywhere and I find them in the bin even though I'm definitely sure I hadn't deleted them. I'm trying to send a video but then again i can watch it on gallery but the video isn't actually there to send??? I have to restore it somehow. Photographs are saved memories and this app puts them in danger. If I had the chance to switch this app with something I wouldn't stop for a minute. It's that bad.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Few feedback . If I search for an album, currently only those uploaded by me are shown and not those shared with me in search results. . A time delay option should be made available before the uploads starts. You see I am. Not a pro photographer, I do make mistakes and I would like to delete those mistakes before it gets uploaded. The delay will allow me to delete/edit photos before it gets uploaded. . The album search is not always handy. It shows photos but many albums which I know are there are not shown. I have to manually scroll through all of. The albums to get it. . The most irritating part, if I share a pic with someone,the app should just give me a link to share which it does but it also for some strange reasons creates a new album with that photo. This eventually ends up clogging my album gallery. You can just give a link using which people can view / download."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I edit my review in this app since the photos are bufferring or mixing with other pictures (it is hard to explain since english isn't my mother tongue). For example, if you view your photos into grids, you can see what are those and when you click it, it will show your other photo but not the one you saw earlier (smth like that) :<< I used to love google photos before since it helps me a lot to save some storage for free but then üò≠üò≠ I hope the programmers of this app will fix that problem :<"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have used this app for years and love the search feature and person/pet recognition. The memories and short videos it creates automatically are fun! Editing capabilities are getting better, but still no way to adjust exposure. A recent update added extra (security?) steps before saving edited images or deleting from the app - very annoying! I will be looking for a new app to manage my photos if this isn't resolved."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"video editing on motog6 is horrendous, actually impossible. previously i edited 30min videos on my motog4 with no problem, basic stuff like trimming the beginning and end. On the editor of this new app, you scroll through an unnumbered thumbnail sequence with images that don't correspond with the scroll point of the video itself, so marking edit point is a total guess, and fine-tuning resets it to beginning. when done, it freezes trying to save!--never w old phone despite slow chip and RAM. bad"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Powerful but feels invasive. Great search function. It uses machine learning to scan all your photos. But can you trust Google with your content? Editing features seem at first glance amazing but it's mostly about adjusting color. Locating photos on the map was recently added but that feature needs to be easier accessed and refined a little bit more. App constantly nags about updating to latest version, it's super annoying."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google Photos has been around for a long time now and I've been using it since forever! It's generally a very useful tool for storing photos and creating backups in case of broken/lost/stolen phones, accidental deletion/random glitches, and clearing up some space from phone storage amongst other things. However at times I don't check in for a while and I realize I havent been signed in for whatever reason so my photos havent been backed up I've misplaced and lost a ton of documents like this, some very sentimental files are gone for good I assume? Is there any way I can access certain files to recover them? Is it possible to extract the hard drive from my old phones to be able to store these items on a USB storage chip if all else fails? What are my options?! Also, how can I ensure that Google is always syncing my files on a daily basis without having to physically verify constantly? Any advice, tips & tricks/hacks would be immensely appreciated y'all!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I very much dislike the new mobile view in Photos, the Libraries tab I find not useful, I cannot see the highlights there, when i receive a notification for new highlight the tap is fine to go to the next picture,but it's hard to rewind, to go back. Usually I will find myself in a prevoius year. You say is's simplified, but for me it is not. I usually do not write reviews, but since this is my favourite app, and most used in my family i thought I'd share."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I accidentally pressed 'Yes' to 'Free Up Space' feature. Now all hundreds of photos in my phone's gallery are gone. I checked out the FAQs of the app, and I learned that before any photos and videos are deleted, files are already backed up in the cloud. I just don't have the original files anymore. But in the backed up files in the app, some of the videos won't play and some of the photos can't be downloaded. I also made a new album but then it won't show up. What's happening here? Any help?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It displays photos. It's very annoying at times as well. Thousands of photos, I always find it difficult to locate a specific picture. I upgraded to Google one and the app still prompts me about the added features that should be enabled from Google one premium. It's very annoying. Scrolling through pictures can be a chore, it's not smooth. I may randomly unintentionally select images while scrolling. Other apps do not integrate the same photo browser, there is always different functionality."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Been a photos user for many years now. It's a good app, does what it's supposed to do - with one exception in the newest version. I want the old memories experience back. The new one is frustrating to use, the UX is poorly thought out, and the music is all unnecessary and only serves to make a pointless, generic experience. It's fine if some users like it - just give us the option to turn it off and go back to the previous memories experience."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Generally love the app, great for freeing up storage on your phone, and deleting admin pictures like old bus timetables. But would be great to see the assistant improved for example I never use the collage but I'm always surgested them. And easy ways to cut down your own videos. Maybe a function to help delete accidental videos or all black photos would be great too. But love the stylised pictures. Just think the assistant could be more personalised, even if you have to answer a short questionnaire"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall the app works well on all my Samsung mobiles. Lots of good features. Any chance you could allow us to turn off the background music on videos? It's lower now so thank you for that but off would be that much better. Photos could also do without this music which is often poorly matched to the content. Like a sick child or deceased relative accompanied by ""out to play"" or ""party time"" themes. Thank you though, I use this app daily."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Google photos! I can't tell you how many times the cloud service has saved me pain stakingly long hours to transfer all my photos and videos. Or when something goes wrong and I could reclaim everything that would have otherwise been lost. I just want to thank everyone who works on this app, for saving what would have been years worth of lost memories!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app to set up and basically forget about, it does it all in the background plus paying for extra storage isn't expensive. The biggest problem I've found is deleting photos from the app actually takes them off your device even if you unsync it so you're kinda stuck unless you wanna spend time moving photos and videos out of folders. It's a huge drawback and it's both confusing and a shame"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Super happy to have my photos automatically backed up when I'm in wifi, all in one account, unlimited. I recently made a photo book using those photos, and it was so easy, AND the best pics were autopopulated into it. Made it so much easier! I also like how google photos makes collages or videos for me automatically & now shows me memories in the story bubbles at the top of the screen. Very user friendly! I just wish the photo albums were not as expensive. :)"

Also.. the assistant gives the option to ""archive"" groups of photos that are either irrelevant or of documents. Could you also add an option to ""delete"" those photos instead, and recognize when there's multiple copies of the same picture (or multiple pictures of the same object) and offer to delete those too? If yoy add these options I will give 5 stars!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Why was this even in my phone to begin with? I already have 2 places for all my photos/videos (Including the secure folders). It just seems like a waste of space. It doesn't even seem to work properly half the time as i have deleted photos and found them again in this app as if i never did it in my main gallery. Same thing when i transfer things between folders. Wouldn't recommend.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app used to be my go to for backup, and I've had it for over 4 years. It's just this year and the previous year have been horrible. It's like Photos never backs up photos anymore, and will always stay on the ""getting ready to backup"" screen. I also remember having to have the app open 24/7 in order to get it to backup only a few photos I myself selected. I don't know what happened with this degrade and why backup just sucks now. Definitely looking into another app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"All around a great app. I've loved it for years! My only issue is that the blur background option has disappeared for all photos, whether portrait or not. That was a great way to remove unwanted appearances on a photo. Please bring back the option. Ive tried everything and even googled to see if the option has been moved, all results say the option is there but im using an android 13 A32, updated google photos numerous times and the option still doesn't appear. Thanks for the great app!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Sure the app displays my images, but additional features are clunky at best. There is no easy/convenient way to rotate images! NO WAY to rotate batches. IT'S SO ANNOYING and inefficient! When I take pictures of documents or artwork, they're usually saved in the wrong orientation, 270 degrees of how they were taken, and I don't know if that's the cameras fault, or Photos'. That's why I'd love a way to rotate batches! Deleting is super slow, too. DO BETTER."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Actually I love this app for everything I can do with it. But my problem is, since a few weeks, my photos are judt backing up sporadically. It always says ""Getting ready to back up"" and then I have to restart the app or my phone several times, until the app backs everything up. If you're able to help me or if you fix this issues asap, I will change my rating instantly to five stars!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The app continuously crashes. When making a movie the app doesn't allow the user to add their own music. Instead it uses Google's generic God awful music which it seems like every song is the same song. In addition Google photos deleted all but 15 seconds of my personal videos that were dated before 2017. The app does not allow anything over a gig to maintain saved. The app and Google need to improve and this is somebody who lives and breathes in the silicon valley right near Google's campus.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When dragging an album on my hard drive to 'Albums', it doesn't create the album, it just adds the photos and mixes them with the 1000's of others on there so I have to create each album manually which is very time consuming. Also when adding pictures to an album, some of them are removed after it says it's transferred them all. (e.g. it says transferring 176 pictures, but at the end it changes to 170. WHY??? FLAWED!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Photos keep being automatically edited once they've been taken. In the preview, everything looks true to colour and texture, the moment I take a photo, it automatically processes, and everything looks much sharper and the colours are completely off. This never used to be the case so I don't know what kind of update caused this, but it's a horrible choice. Not happy. (Pre-emptively, I don't have any filters, editing, anything on. I've looked through editing and settings and nothing is helpful)"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is kinda ok, but has flaws! I don't like, that you don't have an easy method, to select a lot of photos. You have to click them individually, one by one and then you can't even move them in another folder on your device. I still use the app, because it's convenient, but there are better photo apps on the playstore, that aren't as restrictive with YOUR OWN EFFING PHOTOS!!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a great way to save photos & videos to not lose anything after many years, new phones etc. However, it really does make mistakes sometimes... You have to check everything's got backed up before deleting sth, so you don't lose it! sometimes it shows it's backed up but when you delete it, Google photos can't play it, so it didn't save there...but showed it did... Overall it's good app!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love everything about it except two things. My first issue is the movie creator for photo slideshows is terrible compared to Apples Memories feature...if they can fix this part of it, or make it even better than Apples Memories, I guarantee even Apple users will begin using Google Photos for their default photo app. Secondly, sometimes after I edit a photo and save it, the edits take a really long time to actually reflect. Ill think I'm crazy and will go back to re-edit and then realize it just hasn't saved or reflected on the Google servers yet"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's great for storage since it's unlimited in a lower quality. The problem is, the folders you back up aren't kept as folders which is so idiotic. It's worse because they don't tell you it won't be kept as a folder either. E.g, if you have 1000 pictures and 10 folders, it will back them all up without keeping them in folders. Now because it's gotten rid of them off my phone, I can't find any picture that I need to look for. I'll have to search endlessly. Don't know what Google were thinking."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I dont like the way the app copies everything from your phone. If you delete it off photos its removed from your phone but not vice versa. There doesnt seem to be a straightforward way to clear your data off the app (without deleting it off your device). These Google apps are creepy, theres a LOT of access gained to people's personal info! The app on several occasions deleted pics off my phone and made itself the main storage for my photos, supposed to be a back up app. I do NOT recommend."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is so annoying. It used to be great, and is an invaluable way to keep your photos backed up automatically. But for the last year or so it has slowed down to a crawl whenever you do a search. The search tools are and should be great, but they're so slow as to make the app almost unusable (and this is on a recent, high level phone). Backup is shaky also, currently mine is showing as 5,000 photos to be backed up I use app every day, and have fast internet so there's no reason for backlog."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like a lot of the features, pretty good organization. but I get confused about what's in the drive, what's backed up what remains on my phone. It's confusing. It drives me NUTS that the ""select"" option that used to appear when I scrolled down through photos is never there any more. I can't select and delete a bunch. I don't like auto backup + delete, because I have no idea where pictures go and what it's deleting, so this is the preferred way I manage space and it's not a fixed option."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Good design, lots of functionality, and competitive pricing. Update 6/24/19: still rate 5 because ahead of the competion. I do wish Google would make file name (plus extension) available for sorting, searching (looking for a specific filename or type) and enabling better duplicate removal. I feel these are crucial to effective management of photos and videos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It used to be a decent app till it shows some issues. First off, the app lags rather frequently even though the phone has been restarted several times. Furthermore it automatically deletes the estimated locations of some of my photos saved on the app. I have ensured that all the photos have their estimated locations which won't be deleted later on, but over time Google won't let me do so. (Update: the solutions suggested by the developer won't work at all. Shame on you Google)"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very good app. I use it for all my photos. Amazing for sharing and good for organizing albums. I recently got problems though, because some photos in albums are sorted incorrectly (but only on the phone and in the browser it's correct) and some albums are not fully synced in the app, means that I added photos, but online they do not appear in the album and the number of photos listed to the album is incorrect."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I'm a completely sold on Google.. I use all of their apps coz their so gosh darn awesome.. photos is no exception.. it's incomparable to anything else out there.. and it's so thoughtful.. it frees up GBs of space on my device and doesn't even take up my cloud space and the quality of pictures doesn't really seem to change.. plus there are tons of other features especially the assistant it's so intuitive you'd think there's a person picking out and stitching pics into animations and making movies like a pro.. Love you Google you're the best!!
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is just great. It backs up my photos from my phone onto my Google account , so I can access my photos anywhere. It also allows me to clear up space on my phone. There are some really cool features such as: 1. Being able to make physical photo books, canvas prints and normal prints 2. Being able to create collages, animations and slideshows 3. It can sort people using facial recondition and sorting them into folders Overall it is a necessity for anyone who likes photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Google photos. It's hassle free and does everything for me from backing up photos, creating great movies, animations and collages with ongoing advice on storage options. For me, it's a safe, reliable and easy way to manage all my photos with peace of mind that they are backed up and readily available for anytime in the future. The albums and memories that it creates are fantastic too!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really like the flexibility of the storage options. Personally I find it nice to have 10TB because I love overkill. However I am trying to switch over from IOS but it's hard. Google Photos has no folders, nor nested folders, only albums, which makes organizing annoying, additionally I'm not a fan of the UI, Samsung's gallery is much better and it has folders. I just really hope more customization options become available."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app. At times life saviour. Didn't knew what I would do without this if I have to go to certain date or an event to refer data (pictures). This became the biggest setback as well, as I changed the phone and restored cloud, the entire data got shuffled and it lost it's timeline structure. Pictures scattered and now don't have any order. Kindly help if I get it restructured again. Otherwise very useful app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't like this app at all and I think the developers are 'playing' around with it too often. After my editing pictures with names, titles and confirming after each edit, I discovered that a great many CHANGED... Several just had duplicated names or titles applied arbitrarily by the app for no logical reason. I'm going to search for something better, then ditch this over-hyped nonsense asap."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google Photos is so great that I actually ran out of text space trying to write my review. My only complaint is that I only just discovered this app. The best parts are the automatic photo sharing (of people and pets!!) and the highlights feature. It shows you pictures from the past, it groups similar photos to flip through and creates collages of your photos! Can not recommend enough!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"love this app. it organizes your photos, makes little slide shows for you with music as well as groups pictures into albums. its a great app to have if you love taking pictures. you will always have space on your camera because the pitures go right into the app which frees up space in the camera. also you can archive pictures too. try it out you will love it!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Google ruined the photo adjustments completely. It used to have excellent photo adjustment options, with all the sliders for brightness, warmth, exposure, black levels, etc, all on one page, likewise for color, so you could tweak them all easily. Now every single adjustment is its own option you have to select, then alter, then close, then select the next... Please for the love of God fix this. The feature is so clunky and unusable now because someone made a horrendous redesign choice."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"the interface is complicated it should be more like a normal media gallery there's no need to try to be special if it's not gonna be functional, the features it offer are nothing extraordinary. I'm guessing everyone who installs this only do so to keep their photos backed up in the cloud but maybe there's other better alternative with a less unintuitive ui and more attractive features"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Can't back up camera roll. Only all photos. If you use face detection to make an album, it includes anything you might have screenshot from Facebook. If you have it set up to share an album like that, it includes those screenshots without warning you about it. This is unexpected behavior, and could lead to data/privacy breaches. Do not use these features if you value privacy. Also, it only allows facial recognition in the cloud, even though phones these days are more than powerful enough for it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The most amazing way to store your photos! It is so easy to find previously taken pics!! You can search photos by location, thing, holiday, person, month or year!! It recognizes faces and creates folders for each person. If I want to make a collage of my kids, I can easily bring up every photo that has my kids in it. People are always impressed with how quick I can find a pic that was taken years ago! Best app ever!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I can't read the font it's too light and the text too small no delineation between areas or lines. Why would you you change all your apps to such unusable font and color ? I have been able to uninstall the updates while I look for a Google replacement. Already replaced my phone dialer, contacts, calendar, SMS messaging, now I just need to port my emails and find a new photo app. Why are you forcing these changes without options ? I have been with Google since the start. Never had issue before."

I also dont want to see the ""places"", ""things"" and other premade albums at the very top of the app which I never use. Sub-albums would also be very nice. Just adding these basic file management options would make this the best gallery app."

Installed the app again, wouldn't load my pics into the app for me to upload them. 3. Installed the app. A few pics came on the app. Uploaded them. Let me create a link for the folder. Text the folder. Click the link and it says the folder is empty. Went back to the app to check the folder and the folder is gone. The app deleted the folder. Keeps happening."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've used it to take unlimited pictures and video endlessly. (using Google Pixel 3 phone) When you take pictures and video, Google photos pulls the image and videos into the cloud. I have it set to auto purge backed up images/content on my device every 30 days. My only constructive criticism, is that I wish you could set the timer for auto purge (called Free up Space) to a much shorter window. When I shoot a lot of video in one day, I have to manually purge the device sometimes."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app goes with stock firmware and was installed on my device by default. I never used it before, but today it made about 30 notifications in one minute with ‚Äûsuper-cool‚Äú collages and I noticed it. For my surprise app uploaded all my photos to the cloud. I never wanted my photos to leave my phone or be transferred over unsecured network. The app must ask user whether it should upload photos to untrusted servers or not before doing so. Even if Storage permissions granted. Very frustrated."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Backing up photos are great, but it bugs out too often! Everytime I move my photos to a different folder, the app will automatically create a duplicate in the original folder! And if I delete the duplicate, it deletes both pictures from the phone. It completely misses the point of ""moving"" photos. Sometimes the photos don't even load and are just gray squares. Makes everything look unorganized. I wish Pixels came with a regular gallery app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app to manage photos. The new Google Lens integration will be very helpful in the future as AI gets smarter. Also your photos are sometimes automatically processed for filters that MIGHT look good on them(Stylized Photos), so Photos shows you those new photos and provides you with an option to save them. Also the Assistant provides automated clip generation, which makes a little compilation of your clicked photos in a while and turns them into a short movie or something. And you can save them as well"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Still no changes for the better. Photo storage is what your concern is . Honestly I am sure most of us aren't worried about that . How many remember when you could do really nice editing with you phones photo app. Plenty of small options that arent being added and then changing certain features saying they are improving and as far as i am concerned i dont not see the improvements
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Excellent. Works between iPhone and Android very well But, it only lacks one thing.. it is hard to organize massive amounts of photos to one album and it takes an eternity. I believe they need to work on separating photos by day in the main menu or being able to move whole folders from your phone directly into a playlist instead of just to a large gallery of photos where they are forced to be organized again.. it's not fun to organize. But other than that it's really good"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The recent overhaul of the app is a step backwards in terms of usability. It's slow to move between adjustment options, far clunkier than the old design. And it vibrates between each category. Why is that even necessary? I find it completely obnoxious. Photos continually scans folders for photos to be uploaded, and notifies about each new folder found on my device. I don't particularly want google / google photos monitoring any folder, bar the default camera folder for this purpose."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This new photos app. Is basically just a degraded image of its former self, of course there's some emprovement. Price paid for that Improvement is not worth it one thing that I just loved was when you went to which settings you could choose a comfortable View which makes a big difference when you look at your pictures, also photos not only tend to disappear into nothingness. But it's literally done on a regular basis."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the fact that I can very easily access photos from years prior within seconds by using the search bar at the top. I also really enjoy the ""memories"" feature that pops up daily and shows me pictures of what I was doing 5 years ago, or 1 year ago, etc And I like that the app generates automatic photo edits as suggestions, such as- mini animations, ""color pops,"" collages, ""then and now,"" and more! The organization of the app is pretty phenomenal. I would expect nothing less from Google! üòÅ"

No one else can even come close to being as useful and accurate as the search."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"the assistant stuff that it does is absolutely fantastic. the low rating is because sharing photos outside of the Google framework is a giant pain in the ass. downloading my photos to another device is impossible. as soon as I find something that allows easier sharing, I'll never come back, regardless of how cool the assistant features are."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Easy to organize photos in different albums. I really like the Locked Folder option to hide some photos. Limited editing, but I do not do much editing so it is perfect for me. I prefer this program to the Gallery program preinstalled on my phone. There are fun things to do such as animations and videos. Links right to an option to make photo books and so on. Any ""glitches"" or such have been minimal for me and I have been able to figure them out myself. Thank you!"

Recently, I find that if I add a photo to an online album, it mostly just disappears, or becomes corrupted and can't download.

And with that being said, this Google Photos app turns out photos like got a top of the line camera. Very impressed, not overwhelmed, by the choice of filters. No fuss, no muss framework. I would go on but my favorite convent store needs their parking lot back. Kudos, to Google Photos for in my opinion, best in show."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Photos view is not good. Automatic uploading feature is helpful but annoying at the same time because it uploads all the pictures of folder and captured by camera. It would be great if we can select photos and videos which needs to be uploaded. I have to disable this app just because it uses all of my data and speed in uploading unnecessary photos and videos.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is significantly better than the standard android photos, however there are some improvements required. It would be amazing if you could instantly share photos based on faces to more than one account, and if you could include animals. The constant reminders about backup storage is also infuriating, as your storage options are insanely expensive, and I couldn't afford to extend if I tried, so constantly throwing up the reminder is getting incredibly irritating."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There are many good things about Photos, but something that is long overdue is adding the ability to throttle uploads. Google Photos for desktop has it. I live in a rural area, and have slow broadband. DSL slow. If I have backups enabled, taking a video with my phone results in a backup process that kills my internet for potentially hours. Seriously, I am a software developer, I know how easy it is to add speed throttling to a data connection. The app used to at least have a 'only back up when charging' option, but they took that away, so I can't even set it to kill my internet connection while I'm asleep - they have to have it be inconsiderate and use 100% of my 5 meg (less than 1 meg upload) connection."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Poor interface, can't predict where photos will be saved. Edited photos used to get saved in the same filter as the original, but suddenly they're getting sent off to another file (why would anyone want to do that? I added an SD card to save photos too, and now I have two different files on my camera called ""camera"". Apparently one is on the internal storage & the other on the SD card, but the app doesn't make it apparent which is which. Documentation for the app sucks, like most apps."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"3 big problems: |||| 1- Photos isn't fully integrated with Drive. I have duplicated pictures (on Drive and Photos) and, many times, when I try to delete only from Photos I see myself deleting from Drive as well. It's confusing, because the ""info"" doesn't show if the picture is located on Drive or Photos. It should've been clearly labeled (on Info) where the picture is located: Drive FOLDER, and/or Google Photos, why doesn't show the folder on Info??? (when accessed through Photos). |||| 2- Besides that, another issue: there isn't an option to overwrite the original picture after edited. Why? So we need to manually delete every original picture after edited. |||| 3- When I trim/cut a picture the app doesn't show the size (in pixels, ie: 2048x1536 pixels) before saving, so I need to save first to, then, see the size of the resulting picture created? This is so bad, because I need to save multiple times until achieve the perfect final size. |||| Obs: 1 star rating to see if anyone from Google see my comment, please."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good app to store and share pictures but I expect more from Google. Why can't I tell you what folders I want to backup (manually, without autodetect) and why don't you preserve when a picture was taken as opposed to when it was saved (and why can't I manually edit it)? Google, please answer. We need more control on the program. Automation is great until it's stupid (see automatic faucets at the airport)"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Is pretty decent for a free app, tho google certainly makes money from it, so it should be. As usual though, Google works way too hard making the interface 'clean' and ends up making it harder to use. A menu bar with categories organized in a fairly standardized manner makes it easier to learn a group of apps, instead of each one having its own idiosyncratic hodge podge like Google's apps tend to have. I don't find the interface intuitive, and constantly have to hunt around to find things."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"HATE this app! All your photos are never readily available, so you may NEVER be able to find a particular photo you're looking for. Also, photos are archived without your permission and changes made to the app & you're not notified, so unless you use the app, you'll not know it! Not a ""gallery"" like app; it's manipulative and attempts to make money off you by sending photos off to print. I plan to save all my photos onto my drive!"

Search function is second to none - I guess all those ""click all pictures of a speedboat"" capachas work well for sorting algorithms?! Being able to search by face, event, location, something in the photo is a godsend when you have so many - being able to access via computer is also excellent. Literally the top of the photo apps pile - don't bother with anything else. Negatives? Well being asked to order a photo book is annoying!"

I try, it says ""could not be downloaded"". No ideas why. This is a recurring problem. 2. It uploads to all accounts instead of the one I have designated for backups. So I constantly have to be going through my other accounts to delete stuff. If those two problems could be fixed, definite 5 star."

My son tried emailing some photos from my phone, but I don't have a mail app set up. Now Photos won't stop attempting to upload these photos. I don't even know where they're being uploaded! I can't cancel it, and I've tried: force stop, disable the app, restart the phone, various other combos. I don't want to delete the photos, but I'm not sure that would even work. I think I'm going to try 'Simple Gallery', 'F-Stop' or ..."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I had to use this app because the usb port on my old phone was damaged so I couldn't transfer my photos to my laptop so that I can later transfer them to this phone. It saved all of my pictures which was great but now I can't even get them on this phone. You can't press and hold one picture and select an ""select all"" button because there is not such a button. You have to single handedly keep selecting one picture at a time just to figure out the amount of pictures you selected is too many megabytes. Please fix this it is almost 2019 and if you can't do a ""select all"" button at least make a button that can select the squared up amount so it doesn't say ""too many megabytes. "" If not at least don't have the app reorganize the photo folders you made because that also made everything harder to find. I notice it will download the exact folders from the phone with exact photos that you have in them and then just reorganize them that doesn't make sense. Why would you do that?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have been using Google Photos since the first time i bought my phone (Samsung A10), and it has been working great. However, with the new update where you can store your photos in a Locked Folder (which i think is a good idea), when I try to move a photo or video it loads for a little bit and then it closes the app. I dont understand why it does this and I would really want this to be fixed Thanks!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new photo editing flow is terrible. The old one was much faster; you could see all the knobs at once and tweak rapidly. Now it requires swipes side to side to look pretty. Please consider adding back a ""pro"" setting where the settings are all available simultaneously. I'm also having issues where one of my auto albums shows up five times and each has a slightly different number of photos in the folder. I've tried resetting the app to no avail. The duplicates don't show up on the webpage."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The suggestion and flash back feature in this app is incredible. The face recognition works great üëç. Overall I enjoy using the app, but there are some lacks of feature that's really annoying me.

Also, you can find photos specific to a person or date from the bundle of all the photos till date as it helps to sort them accordingly, basis its great recognition features. All in all, worth it and a must to use!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"One suggestion. While I love love love Google Photos, I am still waiting on one tool that allows me to identify photos that are NOT in an album. I organize my photos in albums, and while the 'search' functionality is great, it is easier to locate photos if you know in which album to look for them. Yet, if one misses on putting a few photos in albums, accidentally, then it is very difficult to find them, even with 'search'. Please Google, figure this simple thing out!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"for awhile I was impressed with the simplicity, until I found some annoying problems : 1. you cannot download multiple images to your device. why do I want to download images to my device? because.. 2. you cannot share multiple images on Instagram otherwise! 3. when syncing images from other device, google photos didnt recognize the albums and it's a mess! These problems have been spotted and reported and responded under supports for over a year now but no attempt of fixing them!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"As far as cloud services go, Google Photos is perhaps, by far, one of, if not the best when it comes to backing up images. Its only downside is that it shares the storage size with your Gmail. I would like to see more options for customization, such as background colors and sorting/viewing options, as well as more options for Archive management, such as being able to create folders within the Archive."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app since 2016 and it WAS very perfect and convenient for me who's always have a dozens of pictures to backed up, but now I was disappointed that it wasn't unlimited anymore. Maybe you can have some discounted prize, especially when it comes to students like me and also an option for permanent plan that can last a lifetime. Your plan was so expensive for me who was still a student and doesn't have an income yet just for me to have a backup photo."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love this app. Great quality, and convenient to use. Now that it's recently updated, every picture has horrible quality, and are far worse than the standard gallery app that comes with my phone. I can't even zoom into things properly, especially the ones that are larger files. On top of this, it won't even allow me to download, or share those photos. My hope was to download them to my actual phone, so I could look at, and zoom into things properly. What an embarrassing downgrade."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Generally a good app, but it is lacking in some basic features in favor of complex and unnecessary ones. Really MUST have the ability to rename photos directly (needing to open the Files app just for that is ridiculous), suggest new names when copying (if same name, such as after an edit), save copies in different formats (like png), and to sort by filename. I only use this app to view and search my images. I have pretty much all extra features disabled, because they are irrelevant to me."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like the auto editing feature of this app. For example, sometimes i found the panoramic photos are too narrow length-wise, I then would take several photos horizontally for the same view so that Google Photos sometimes is smart enough to stitch them together. I wish I knew how Google Photos edits and creates special effects for my photos. I couldn't seem to find the right editing tools or options to do so."

I cannot find anything and the thought of now having to go back and redo all is irritating. Also, the ""assistant "" on this app is useless and one more thing I have to go through and delete. is there a way to disable that portion from this app?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Most of my recent photos (from the past several months) have suddenly dissapeared from the app. They aren't in trash or the archive, and they're still visible in the files app, but seriously? This is ridiculous. Most apps automatically access photos from this app so I'm not able to use recent photos now. Also image previews are messed up too. I'll click on one image and another, not visible in any of the previews, will show up. This needs to be fixed."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the cute little videos, stylized photos and gifs the google photo assistant creates for you. It gives you look backs on this day from previous years. And the google lens helps with shopping and image recognition. It still needs a little work but over all a pretty cool thing. Very easy to edit photos and create simple collages within the app as well."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I like that it offers unlimited storage, but it's still messy. The first time I used it I made the mistake of allowing the backup of every folder and now when I try to delete ""useless"" pics that I only want in my phone but not there, I can't delete it only from the account? It should be easier to do and seeing the pics based on the date isn't always that helpful, I can't find anything."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The most recent update is HORRENDOUS! It is now a painstakingly aggravating process to adjust photos. Every setting has been separated. They used to be together on one screen with drop-down arrows to expand the selections. It was so easy and quick to adjust photos. What took seconds now takes minutes of going back and forth between settings to find just the right balance. The UI designers should be ashamed of themselves.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Having problems with organising album using Android OS. I have to use my PC to ensure the uploaded photos are really added into my desired album. Is a double job. Can't select photo to be album cover, can't download photos from the app, all have to be done by PC version now. Heck, it never happened before! Please fix it. This was the best image storage app ever."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Pros: unlimited storage, 1 photo (w/o copying) can be in multiple albums unlike folders on a desktop Cons: The collage function is useless as it chops off heads; when I downloaded pictures from an SD card it randomly changed the date on some pictures to 1-1-1980, really?!?! that was a pain!; I couldn't figure a quick and easy way to send pictures back to my phone so I could use my phone's collage function. (I had to email, opn, dwnld, find so I could make a collage that the heads weren't cut"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It takes over my phone and does what it wants. I have very little control. I don't want to have a cloud account. Give me THAT OPTION!! How horrible that someone else (err, Google) thinks that you should do things their way. I hate Google apps (almost with a passion now) and this whole Google Photos auto backup and no control from your phone, is just another annoying example."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is about as good as it gets. On any Android device as a photo browser alone its vastly superior to any device manufacturer disaster. It's also a nearly perfect photo backup app. Once google allows original resolution cloud storage for free, there aren't going to be any other photo apps left standing. The ""AI"" feature detection is extremely impressive for something the app presents in a low key way. Feature, not face, is accurate here! It reliably detects my dog apart from other dogs."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Not all of us take photos, so having it open to an empty screen and having to navigate to the correct location (library) is a pain in the neck. No options at all to change this, really, is google not a leader in tech? When you get to library, one third of the page is a suggestion for a photo album? I'm not a soccer mom Google! This app is just trash, not user friendly, no customization, and just poorly implemented. Never using again, will be another disabled junk app on my phone, thanks Google."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"New interface SUCKS. Trying to view photos and videos from notifications (look back on this day, furry friend, etc.) is no longer user friendly. It's this endless autoplay junk instead of linking to an album of pictures from three years ago today, or a discrete video. And the tab for all of that stuff seems to be gone. This is pointless, unhelpful ""progress."""
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love it! this has been a lifesaver since losing my photos on my phone on 2 different occasions. I love the automatic backup, and like the photo creation options in the assistant. the only thing I don't like is when I choose photos to animate, the animation is a lot slower than when assistant does it automatically. I would like to see the user created animation speed be the same speed as automatic/assistant animations."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app is good overall since it has never been compromised u still have all of my photos since 2012 and although there is a fee for storage now its not costly at all. Yes a bit deceiving as we the notion was this would be free but not extreme. I do wish you could save albums the way you want or edit the albums they make for you to remove or add certain pictures but I have not been able to do so as of yet.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,My only real gripe with this app is that it doesn't upload albums so when your trying to find a specific picture you have to scroll through EVERYTHING and it's incredibly frustrating. Can you implement this feature please. And to implant a feature that if you backup your photos from your device it automatically sorts out what's there into the allocated albums so I don't have to spend days combing through and sorting them out manually. Thank you.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Bring back the ""open with"" feature! For some reason a recent update did away with the ""open with"" feature, which I used all the time. I liked to use it to be able to choose photos to edit in a different program (a Google program), but now I have to do it the long way :( I also don't like the way it opens up when you hit the menu button (three lines). Why'd you have to f up a good thing Google?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely love the app, it's a silent life saver. It is always working in the background to make sure the images you captured are still available. I can't tell you how many times I've thought I lost a picture forever only to open the application, for some random reason, and see the missing memory living right there all along. That's why I call it a life saver, for me at least. Whether it's a storage issue, or cleaning up the productivity of my devices, I accidentally delete priceless pictures."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Annoying, inconvenient, time consuming problem when I save some photos from the Web, Facebook or Pinterest to the Google Photos gallery. They don't always show up at the top of the gallery like you'd expect. I find them(if I'm lucky) buried hundreds of photos deep in the gallery instead of at the top! Why do they do that? Does it have to do with the source for the photo, the date of the original photo?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Has been great until recently when it stopped syncing any videos that are more than about a minute long. I tried restarting the phone, uploading over cellular/wi-fi, uninstalling and reinstalling the app to no avail. This is really frustrating as I pay for storage each month and these videos are just as important to me as my photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"After back up related changes, even when I have selected original quality with no change and turned off the back up, somehow the back up is still in action and I lost my data real quick. I don't know how it is doing back up even when my device photos were already backed up properly. This is one of the worst experience regarding Google photos. I am using it since long time and was really happy with it. This issue should be resolved."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It is okay but often irritating to work with. It does make cute compilations of photos and memories for you, but I have had a recurring issue that doesn't seem to have a good fix: the application messes up the dates of my photos and lumps them all together randomly. On a browser it works just fine, but in the app it often mixes the pictures up."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Edit, i use this app daily and i hate it. Now a notification is always up like it's uploading constantly and i see no way to easily stop it... tried settings and disabling sync... the idea of organizing my photos into shared albums would be useful but the interface is terrible... shifting to 1star and going to look for alternatives... After a recent update the ability to add/put selected photos into a shared album is missing, this is a key feature for anyone who plans to use shared albums."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app, easy to use. I save everything on it. It's great when I break my phone and lose everything, i can just get it back, plus it saves room when you need room but don't want to delete photos and videos, you can save them online, then take off your devices. One thing I wish though, is being able to download an album, or multiple pics/Videos. You have to save each one separately."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Not at all happy with this. Lately it's been telling me that my storage is dangerously low and that I need to delete some files and etc. This happens even when I open up Messenger to send a text and when trying to take photos in which it won't allow me to do until I delete files, only fir it to repeat the same thing a few days later. #I'mveryannoyed"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Live Albums (10,000) limit Live Albums seems worthless unless you have very few photos, once you have over 10,000 nothing more will get added so it isn't exactly live anymore. I can't think of any work around other then deleting older photos so that I have fewer then 10,000 showing up to allow new pictures to be added. I can't believe this wasn't seen in testing, and I'm sure I can't be the only one that has thousands of pictures over many years."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love using gphotos. I am not an advanced user... just someone who has a phone with very little storage, so the ability to automatically store in the cloud is critical. The only feature I'd like to see added is the ability to organize items in the same way that other Google services do... with tags/labels. I've tried to use albums for this purpose, but it's not meant for that and gets too difficult to manage as the number of albums increases."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The photo editing tools are useful, but the rest of this app fails miserably at being a photo gallery. Want to hide directories? You can't. Want to rearrange albums, folders or anything at all? You can't. Want to resample a video to make it small in size? Ha, sorry. Make gifs from a video? Nope, can't do that either. Such simple things would make this app actually useful instead of hard coded non-options, but then that would be giving users control and I guess Google won't let that happen."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So much basic functionality that just isn't. You can't select all photos in an album, you can't archive photos from albums, it doesn't back up folders as folders, so it just dumps everything into one big pile. But seriously, being able to ""select all"" is the most obvious function imaginable, and yet no one at google has bothered to incorporate it ever. Like a car that can't go in reverse. Wake up and incorporate some of the most BASIC FUNCTIONS expected of any storage program/app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The ""favorites"" star randomly appears sometimes. When it does, I'm unable to move any photo to another folder. I like the star, because it allows me to flag a photo that I want to keep, and mass delete other ones I don't. But it would be nice to be able to have it around all the time and also be able to use the move to folder feature. Also there's a new error that says photos doesn't have access to my SD card to delete a photo."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"After all the hype, very disappointed. It's not very good at organising photos the way I want, it seems it has too be the google way. It hides albums on google drive when it should be syncing with my other devices, and will not let me transfer albums to a usb drive. I thought these things were supposed too make your life easier, disappointingly this seems to be the case. Will have to look elsewhere. It's all about buying photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is the best app ever. It makes animations when you take multiple pictures at a time, stylizes your photos automatically (but doesnt overwrite the originals), and makes collages and albums for you. Sometimes it even labels the albums for you automatically if you have location on. For example: Disneyland, Saturday December 25th. Love it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I just wanna look at my pictures without things like ""search inside screenshot"" or ""copy text from image"" or ""fix lighting"" popping up.

I don't want to have to download a whole 'nother app for tools that should already be in the one I have. Would be much appreciated üôè"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There is something severely wrong with this app. I noticed some pictures had gone missing. After the initial scare, I realized it's just this app being broken. All my photos were showing in my phone using a file browser. I tried Google's new ""Gallery Go"" app and it shows all my missing photos. Gallery Go shows over 100 additional photos in my camera app and a few dozen more in my downloads folder over what this shows."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Overall, it's nice to have a backup in full resolution, but when it have to update content that you backed up anfd then you edit on the phone, like a slow motion video, Photo is the worse. It wont update and no matter what you do on the phone, if you try to download the video, it will be downloaded the entire video on slow motion, not the section you would want."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I wish this app was configurable. I liked having a menu dropdown in the upper left to access my image files like a sentient being who understands concepts like folders. The new version is insulting to the intelligence and painful to use. The ""library view"" with half the screen taken up by links to print pictures onto products, utilities I've no use for, and image folders below that enlarged and spread out two by two so that you can't scroll to them easily. I want the old app back!!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The editor used to be so simple (doesn't need to import, you can just edit directly in your gallery), yet the result is already good. It's good enough that make me rarely used any other photo editor apps. But I certainly DON'T LIKE the NEW INTERFACE. Please bring back the editor paramater that stacked in row, from top to bottom. It's much easier to edit when you can see several parameter at once than when you need to swipe left or right just to see other parameter."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best 'gallery' app IMO. First and foremost, it does a great job at it's primary task, being your photo gallery.. Next, it auto-backs up to my google cloud, for free since I have a Pixel. As if that wasn't enough, it's smart. It makes it easy to create albums, collages, and even do basic editing in a very intuitive way. I really love how simple it is to modify the color and/or light attributes of a photo I just took, though most of the time, it's smart enough to adjust colors well enough that I can leave them alone. Also, it sometimes makes videos for me and even though they're not always perfect as what content i want in the video can vary widely, I do like them and still watch them anyway. Keep up the great work Google."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Great App, but it just missing some key features, being able to see all non ablum photo so you can which ones you need to sort. This non-ablum should be a pre-generated ablum that allows you to see all of this. Plus when they did there unlinking with drive. I had some photos left in drive and don't know if they are in my Google photos area. Why didnt they just bring everything over, so I don't have to do the guessing game. Please fix this and be better about changes in the future."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"works well for me, no issues, but I'm not very demanding. I take pictures of rental cars both when I get them, again when I return it. I keep the pictures for 1 year. So the feature of grouping the pictures by month is a very useful feature for me. The lighting feature is nice as well. That's about all I do with it. I'm sure a photographer would get much better use."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the unlimited storage, and of course since Google is integrated into my life, my stored photos are synced across my devices so I can access them easily anytime, anywhere. I also love how Photos makes animations, collages, movies, and edits of existing photos. While I don't save most of them, sometimes I find gems, like when the app made an animation of photos of my cat."

Update: After going to Contact Developer I've got email response - ""You have emailed to an address that is no longer being monitored."" And this is the app that is getting updated regularly! ü§î Update 2: After few hours the application started showing proper dates, without any updates or changes. Not sure what was it, but the whole ordeal with inability to submit issue and a bunch of wasted time makes me very uncomfortable with Google. ‚òπ"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app. Free from the annoyances of ads intruding often like the other equivalent apps. One glitch is that while browsing by sliding the pages, the order of appearance follows file size. Even when you sort by name (a-z), while browsing by sliding each page, the appearance or the browsing do not follow a-z by name. The browsing happens only by file size - smaller to larger. This must be corrected so that we can choose how the image order changes while browsing. So 4 stars only"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very good app for viewing, organizing, and sharing photos. It runs smoothly and the user interface is nice once you get used to it. They also have picture and album recommendations that make it easy to highlight and display your photos. However, the photo editing is very lackluster and bland compared to other apps. Cropping is easy, but drawing and adding text is a pain."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've been enjoying this app forever, love the backup feature and literally everything about this app. However, the new look of the ""memories"" feature is awful. I can't enjoy the pictures when they're moving around the screen and the date isn't as easy to read. I wish there was a way to opt out of this new look and go back to the old one. But I still love the app, just ruined the memories :/"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A great place to store all your photos without losing any quality of the image or video. One of the best thing about this app is it groups images and videos based on location and date. So when want to check the image later after a long time just type in the date or location and there it is. The assistant in google photo automatically generates stylised photos, animations and videos from the images or videos we upload. Another awesome thing is face grouping."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Sync all my photos without permission and dumbed the photos off my phone. The photos that were synced are not near the quality of the originals. So pissed. I tried to turn off Back up and Sync but it still syncs. Best thing to do is remove any access for the app and disable it. It makes no sense anyhow. My phone has its own gallery app that works wuite fine.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"it's ok. it auto stores photos from my phone but lacks few things: 1. I like grouping photos into albums and in my phone, once a photo is moved to the album, it disappears . in google app it still shows in the general folder even though it is moved to the album as well. gets confusing and I can't organize it the way I like. 2. it auto stores ALL the photos, even the ones I deleted from the phone. in order to delete all of these from google photos I have to go years back and end up with garbage"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to work great now it gets stuck backing up my photos. Back up on automatically but it doesnt. it just attempts to do it ALL DAY. so I turned it off. Yet sometimes it still tries. I have to force stop it many times a day.backs up files from blocked folders. Tried using high quality instead of original. Have space on my account. Used wifi. Manually tried to back up files - some work, but eventually it'll stop. Mostly videos get it frozen. Uninstalled/reinstalled, signed in and out. No fix."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I really dislike the controls for the 'memories' function where. It shows highlights from the past. Can't zoom in the pics, can't interact with them in the normal way, like you can when viewing a photo from the main gallery. Inconsistent UI is annoying!! Every time a memory appears and I try to punch zoom or double tap etc and it responds differently than usual, it pisses me off."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is great! It collects photos from all my devices, and backs them up in case something bad happens. It also gives the option of deleting safely backed up photos to free up space, and they are still viewable. It also makes editable albums for you and gives you the option to accept or reject them. This app is quite convenient and very helpful!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's a very powerful app the main advantage is the Google ecosystem the fact that you can back up anything to your Google Drive. But it lacks some features comparing it to other gallery apps. For example you cannot rearrange The People that shows up on the facial recognition. And I think that you also should be able to select equality for backing up your videos and photos individually
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Amazing that I can sync and view photos from different devices. BUT, notice that Google Photos will ONLY backup the content within your device folders, so your device photos like camera photos, screenshots, Twitter photos will be all MESSED UP into one place. You can never find your photos by folder anymore if you categorize your photos by folders, which will be recognized as ""albums"" in common galleries. Annoying."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Not very customizable. I dislike that I can't turn dates off, I don't want to see my photos grouped by the date they were taken, I should have the ability to turn that off. Also I don't like how it always defaults to show all my pictures, I'd rather it default to album first and let me closer which album. A dark theme would also be a nice touch. would love the app so much more if they added customizability to it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great! but could use a few improvements. it lags a lot and seems to have a hard time handling lots of photos and videos. it will crash sometimes on the computer. I do love that it syncs well and has some basic photo adjustments you can do to improve your photos without having to learn Photoshop or Lightroom. Perfect for what i need it for.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,A great program. A great editor. It has a lot of potential for sure. I even like the advanced AI I get when I paid extra from Google One now BUT the horrible part right now is to use those nice advanced AI it ONLY allows a save as instead of save when I edit. IT DOES allow a save over when using the free editor. So I don't use it because it really stinks to have to save as and figure out the other and go in and delete it. It's just a bad process. Maybe they will fix this???
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have been using this app for about 10 years now. At first I lovedddd it bc it automatically backed up my photos and that was it. Exactly what I needed. But now it just seems like spyware and really intrusive. For example why is every photo being grouped into a category (woods, food, swimming, playground)? I can't turn this feature off but I don't like it because it means all of my pictures are being looked at.. Even the private ones. I will be finding another cloud service as soon as possible."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm so thankful that Google came out with this, it was and is terribly useful. I do have to admit I have been most reluctant to trust any online or cloud services with my precious photos. Google has this far lived up to earning my trust, mostly. I did prefer it, before the more recent changes. I liked the old way of sharing albums and viewing photos from my phone. I do not like not having control of the layout. Please fix this before adding anymore bells and whistles. Thank you."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"A little complex to navigate, but packed full of a wide variety of options for your photos and videos. I will say the cloud feature is excellent, and syncs across devices very quickly; it makes uploading photos to other platforms and apps really fast, and helps me back up the really important ones onto my computer when I need to. I really don't need anything else; Google Photos does so much already!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very disappointed with the latest version. The app crashes when I open 4K HDR video, and the whole phone become laggy and I can't even launch the camera after that. The only fix is to reboot my phone, which is quite annoying. Also, the app is laggy when swiping through individual photos quickly, and it freezes for a while when there is a video, which is unacceptable for an album app. Finally I uninstalled this app and look for alternatives. Ironically, there are no such issues on Google Files."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really like google photos other than the albums. When making an album, it doesn't tell you how many pictures you can add at once and won't add any of the pictures if you go over this imaginary limit. Also, the albums' direction is from oldest to newest, so everytime I want to check if the photos are actually in there I have to scroll all the way down. I would give better stars if the problems with the albums were fixed. I am very satisfied with the sharing part, though, and really like it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's very refreshing having the app that does it all, and google does that for me. It's a place I can store ALL my photos and videos, without sacrificing size or quality, while keeping them organized. The edited abilities are also great! Great filters and recommendations are always good options. Google makes it easier to capture, keep, and share memories. Thank you, Google!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is lacking some of the most basic features that would be expected including 1. An ability to distinguish and classify videos. Videos are stored under photos and makes them very difficult to find. 2. Tools to sort and filter photos and videos. By size, most importantly, name, date, etc. 3. It is pretty much impossible to figure out what's been loaded and what hasn't. Google says what percent of photos have been loaded, but doesn't show dates or other info about what's been loaded"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My experience was and is still very good and amazing with this app. Once again, kudos to you Google for making such a great, useful, easy, practical, safe, and user-friendly app! Now I'm gonna keep this short, because I usually don't write reviews for any kind of app plus I don't have a lot of time. Just everything from all sides about this app is really good, especially the saving and cloud storage and all that. Plus the automatic (and manual) movie-making, collage-making, animation-making amaz"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Like the Trash tab in the app. With it, you can recover or permanently delete one, some or all photos or videos if you accidentally delete them. Also, like the ""scroll calendar"" because you can recognise the dates the photo was taken or the video was recorded. And, speaking of scrolling, I like the ability to display dates during scrolling down or up for the same reason."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What a terrible product. It seems to have been created solely with phones in mind, because the only good thing it does is saving a copy of your phone's pics automatically. Other than that, it's worthless. Its sync functions are useless, so trying to manage folders here is impossible (you'd think the top tech company in the world would be better at this). Using Photos for something so simple as unifying files across devices? Nope. Not happening. This app requires a painful amount of manual work."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I think this app is very helpful, you can search for a specific picture and find it faster than if it we're just on your phone. It also makes some edits and suggestions that save a lot of time, along with sometimes making collages. It also save a lot of space on your phone when you can back up picture to this app. I am a little unsure of if/ how you can transfer the pictures back to the phone storage. Also when you don't have data or wifi connection you can't look at them. This is annoying."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! Very easy to use, love the added suggestions it has for albums, panos, movies, animations, and more! I don't know how long it's been around but I can't believe I just got it a last year. It makes life so much easier when you want to save photos and videos but you don't want to burn up space on your phone! In the past I had to manually back them up, this does it for me automatically! Some people worry about photos in the cloud. I'm very cautious, but not tin-foil hat paranoid!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This has been my go-to app for photos for a long time, so I'm pretty invested in it. I'm always amused by the auto-generated stylized photos. But I really dislike the new Android updates (starting when - I don't know). I try to check out whatever notification and only ever get a photo scroll that I can't stop or start from the beginning. Super frustrating. Please get rid of the photo scroll. My personal photos are Not an instagram story. I will never want them to be."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Fantastic App by far above the rest. I love Google Photos for many reasons. Mainly because you get unlimited storage of pics m videos. They sort out all the duplicates, documents, upsidedown pix. N what i think is soo cool is they group individual faces into a single album. so it makes searching for that one picture u took 7 years ago of so and so soooo much easier. Yes they save alot of much needed space on my phone as well. so for that im impressed and grateful."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Non user-friendly. Too much unnecessary stuff. But doesn't allow for the most obvious functions like ""arrange by date"", at least you have to purposely look for it (I still couldn't find). Photos are a total mess and I can't find a way to sort them. Rather have no fancy nonsense, but just a simple library by date where I can scroll and find the pictures taken."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I love everything Google but this requires some work according to me. The 'album' tab only allows viewing of six (unnecessarily) large album icons/thumbnails at a time. Would appreciate if one could change that to say a list view or zoom out like in the 'photos' tab to include more. Not to mention that it's practically impossible to bulk delete albums seeing as you cannot select them individually by long pressing. Kindly fix.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have used this app for as long as I remember and never had an issue with it then all of a sudden this new update comes in and changes everything. From the new vertical arrangement of the folders to the fact that it completely deleted my albums and even some of my photos and videos üòï I woke up just to be annoyed by the app. I had to disenable auto update because that is never happening again.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible and incredibly frustrating!! It's so confusing to use, doesn't organise photos intuitively, requires an internet/data connection to load and display photos even though they're stored on my actual phone, can't select all photos in an album easily (no menu option) and can't copy from an album to a new folder on my SD card at all... Makes organising and sharing photos a proper hassle when it's easier and quicker to simply use the built in Android file system tools. Utter rubbish!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Very buggy. I tried to ""free up space"" but the button just wouldn't do anything. After updating and restarting didn't fix it, I cleared all the app data. It took most of a day for it to reload everything, but finally the free up space worked. Unfortunately since then, the memories are not showing up. There is a large blank spot in the UI where they should be and when I click the notifications for new memories it just opens a blank screen and never loads. Not worth using without the free storage."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"For some reason it's completely jumbled up and/or duplicated a bunch of photos from a few months ago, and videos can't be played. These are all files taken on and saved onto my device. The problem has been persisting for a couple months through all app updates. Edit: it's not happening anymore thankfully but the media I was referring to in this review are still mixed up and corrupted."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Google photos is one of the best apps ever. It is very smart ans does everything for you all you have to do is be connected to wifi and it uploads all photos to a server with anyother of your phones with the app. No need to try to spend hours transfering your photos from your old phone to your new one its so easy. This app is extremely helpful. It also gives you the options to name people in your photos and you can view all photos with them in it.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There is lacking of a few features that other apps have. Editor is lacking, duplicate reduction is also still in what shouldnt be its infancy. I'm just disappointed at the lack of features. However; the storage is great. Its essentially unlimited and the filing system is great. The archive part is confusing and is drive and photos still inertwined.? That was odd as well. Please incorporate a gif capable slideshow. Seriously! Its been like ten years."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The UX deteriorated in recent years. The memories produced by the app are very good, but ruined by the fact that photos scroll automatically and there is no way to turn it off (except for individual images). Also, the photos zoom slightly when the memory is played, and I really don't want that. I understand the app is made for people with an attention span of a fruitfly, but please let others disable the automated movement / switching. Thanks!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google has not failed to impress me yet! This is definitely my favorite app! I love the feature where it can try to guess what is in the picture. It is not always accurate, but it is close enough a lot of the time, and sometimes it does guess accurately the item in the photo. It can correctly guess what breed my dog is! That is extremely impressive how far technology has come! Also the rest of the features are cool too! Like the ar stickers and editing. And the way it shows pictures from years ago as memories is nice! I must also mention that I have had several phones and this app contains the pictures from all of them."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app used to be great. I liked the organization and the ability to watch memories this it piles up for you. The last update is trash ! Suddenly photos are not in the dates I took them and it's really buggy. Another thing in mind is cloud. Although it's not expensive, I don't want to spend money to back up my photos. It keeps forcing me to back them up because I'm out of memory, and it really annoying. Overall just not good"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app progressively gets more frustrating to use. First, you place photos out of order, so i have to scroll through thousands of photos for a picture i took a week ago, and now the ""group similar faces"" feature doesn't work. I reset the feature multiple times, in the process it made me lose all the great memories I've had with certain people."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Like a virus. Horrible user experience. Will not let me access without also allowing full access to my device's photos, which means it upload photos automatically when I open the app (without even having that setting selected), and does not allow me to delete photos from the app without also deleting them from my phone. Restoring them on one restore them on the other as well. It is consuming my google drive space, which I cannot fix unless I find a workaround on my pc. Awful and frustrating."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Not a very good app. There should be either files or folders... not both. Sometimes I can't access a photo because it's in a file /folder I can't get to. I'd like to be able to either copy or move a photo and if i move it, there's only one copy. The way it's set up I have duplicates and triplicates and I can't get rid of the extras. Sometimes, if i try to delete a duplicate, it will delete all copies rather than just the extra copies. It's a very confusing app. I'm VERY unhappy with it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Fu@k this app!!! I have never downloaded it, used it or even thought about using it, and yet I have to disable and force stop daily to remove this application from my phone. You cannot completely uninstall it or disable it from your phone. And yet somehow it pops up every 24hrs to take over as your primary photo editing application. If I can figure out how to delete this application permanently from my phone, I will most definitely be doing so. This isn't an app that came pre-installed."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"If there is anything good at all that I can say about this app, it's that it at least lets me keep all files in one place and it neatly segregates my files into folders according to how the filed were obtained - there is a screenshot folder, a camera folder and a folder for almost every editing app. That's great, however there are many things about this app that could be improved. First of all, why is it that I can't create folders simply how I want? Why can't this storage app be like the 'Computer' icon in Windows, where it actually allows you to create folders, rename folders, delete folders, make folders within folders and move files however and wherever you want? Also, there is an issue with deleting files - it takes something like 5 minutes to delete 60MB of data. Why, may I ask?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I think that this app is very helpful. It shows your videos and photos on the day and location it was taken on. It also makes animations, collages, and cool displays of the photos and video you took. And last of all....it saves your data all on your email. So if your phone is broken it is already saved. P.S. It can also easily share data with others."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It works well enough as a camera roll app. But there are some quality of life changes I'd like to see. Like being able to select more than one photo at a time to download to my device. I also get very, very tired of the constant ads in the app to order printed photos, get photo albums, etc. I really don't appreciate being advertised to in a core app on my phone and would very much like if the interface was streamlined more and those ads were cut."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"i love most of it, but it keeps deleting photos in a folder that's not marked to be synced and there's no way to turn it off. it also backs up all of your photos in one place, which is a horrible because i have separate folders for separate photos, i dont want to see them all in once place so im only able to back up pictures from my camera app. i want to backup memes and pictures i take with my friends in separate folders and see them in separate places, not all at once in the ""photos"" tab."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing. I've saved so many photos because of Google Photos. I had a corrupted SD card once and cried thinking all my precious memories were gone, but autosync was on. Everything was safely stored online! Then, I dropped my phone and all my internal storage photos were inaccessible. But there they were on new phone, in the app! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Does basic things adequately I suppose but lacks many features and the ones that it does have are clunky. For instance, rotating photos, a process that happens often with phone pictures, requires you to click edit, then crop(?), rotations then save. This slows you down considerably when editing. There's no option to flip on either axis and no filter to create a negative. I guess this is good enough for hasty pics on Facebook but if you want to do any real editing, then this app isn't much use."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Ok but nowhere near what I expected. I use Google apps for pretty much everything - email, drive, calendar, notes, wallet etc and I love them all. Photos is really lacking, eg you can't import from drive to photos, you have to download then upload which takes forever. You can't view which photos aren't in an album (like on Flickr for example) so organising is really hard. And i have backup turned off but everything from my phone gallery goes to google photos, can't work out why."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This app would appear to be a good way to keep a copy of photos safe but it lacks key functionality and I now wish I'd not used it. I was swapping phones and decided to back up my photos and videos from my old phone using this service. The issue is a lack of ability to perform a restore to my new phone. I can download one photo at a time but not all together or a selection. Pretty useless in my opinion.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Thanks for ruining photos! It was really too user-friendly. Who needs an entire sidebar of menu navigation items when users can go on an frustrating scavenger hunt instead? Why should the default photo app make it obvious and easy to get to your device folders? It's really way more important to prioritize selling prints. You did NOT simplify, you took a functional app and turned it into a mess."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've had Google Photos installed for 5+ years and it's been great. Very reliable. Only recently have I noticed that my photos have began to be saved under the wrong year. Photos that were originally taken in like April 2017 are now backed up in August 2017 and that's not particularly helpful as I like to keep a timeline of events. Also, if you scroll too fast the app crashes altogether. üôÑ"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Not sure what the user experience is like for this app on iphones, but I have a Google Pixel 2XL and it is amazing!!! The pre-set filters and editing experience is clean and so simple to use. i do wish there was a feature to blur areas of an image to make them appear out of focus, but outside of that I enjoy everything about this app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really love this app except when I'm looking at memories for the day and see a pic or 2 that I want to send, but while in the Google photos app I'm unable to send straight from there to Google voice. I literally have 2 go into voice, start a txt msg so that I can now look for the pic I wanted to send, but sometimes it takes 30mins just to find it again. I loose interest and never get it sent. I think all of ur apps should be able to coincide with each. Other than that love app"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I snap a shot today and go to make edits and suddenly everything has changed. Prior version had better control, was more intuitive, and didn't resemble the garage Apple interface. Now it does. I can't find any way to adjust preferences either. Haptic feedback is an awful feature. It's been off on my phone since the day I bought it, yet I can't turn it off for Google photos. Such garage. Welcome suggestions. Thanks!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Always a great app to save all photos to.. especially after switching devices. I can go all the way back to 2014 ( 5 phones ago ) and find all my pics in one place. The only thing is the editing options could be way better. And I would like to be able to move photos from all photos to a specific folder and the photo not be in the general layout. I prefer to separate into designated folders without having to see them as soon as I open app
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's not perfect, but is absolutely an essential app for me because of it's automatic backup and cloud storage capacity. I know several people that lost or destroyed their phones, and all the pictures of children and relatives along with it. It's amazing how happy they are to see that those photos can still be accessed through the cloud. It's not perfect for everything, but the backup/archive feature is amazing. Let it run in the background, and backup over wifi. Really a lifesaver!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The storage alone is something to brag about, but this goes so far beyond that- it's insane! I bought a picture book of my pics and it is great! The app is so well designed. You can simply search the word flower and every picture you have with a flower comes up. You can basically give faces names so that you can search for a certain person in your photos. It documents your location where photos were taken and even makes short movies with your video clips and pictures. It's really awesome! I love Google Photos!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Loving the new Photo Frame feature. Smart and useful search. Editing features are quick and fast for basic enhancements, not all-inclusive but enough for practical purposes. Recent updates appear to have dropped a hold-drag to select multiple picture/videos instead of clicking one by one. Lost üåü here, please bring it back or share a tip on how to do it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A really good photo system, hub, and integration suite. Sadly, the half of the app focused on selling me Flickr type stuff can just be annoying and intrusive for some of us, and toggling that off or hiding it would be great as an option. Still, the most seamless app for photos and management I can imagine. Makes sharing images between my pc and phone effortless."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"HIGHLY DISGUSTED!!!! If I knew this app was going to remove the pictures from my actual camera roll, I would've never used it. I thought it was just backing up my pictures...not backing up and removing. Additionally, this has created problems with me receiving emails. Like seriously...y'all need to fix this thing. There is no reason why I can't do what I want to do and then possibly have to pay for more storage. I just want my pictures back in my camera roll without losing them in both areas."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app provides a great way of storing and viewing my photos in an orderly way. You can make it automatically update your photos to your drive so that if you run out of memory you can remove them from your device with the click of a button. It also creates filtered items and albums for you from certain groups of pictures. Really glad I keep it updated for all of the useful features!
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Can be useful at times. But sometimes my pictures are saved (under the 'photos' tab on the app) but will appear under a different date than when I took the pic/screenshot. IE, if I took a photo and saved it on 5/27/23, then it'll appear under a different date, like a few days back, I uninstalled this app to see if the problem is fixed, but it hasn't. This problem is only happening under the 'photos' tab on the app, but it works fine under the other tabs."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Photos are packed many different ways so relatively easy to find. One of my favorite features is when the app somehow selects certain photos and ""stylizes"" them. My biggest complaint is that it only selects one every 3 months or so. I wish it would select and stylize many more of my photos. They are usually very interesting if not downright fantastic."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I get so frustrated when putting photos together. I can find some stuff, but can never seem to really find what I am looking for. I dig and dig and even if it is a brand new picture, if I edit it, the edits disappear and I can never post them. sometimes it takes my picture sideways, and it is really frustrating to not be able to have a rotated copy on hand. I do not like several of the updates. I thoroughly miss the option to make a ""hidden"" photo option as well."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Liked the app. Very useful. Unlimited storage is the biggest highlight. In my opinion, deleting photos from a album should remove photos from the library too. It is very hard to remove a particular photo from the library once the library is stacked with lot of photos. Also, noticed the photo syncing having some issues at several occasions. Overall a wonderful app to manage all your photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I like my photos to be saved automatically and this app does that . This app also backup my photos and clear up the space from phone. It is too amazing. Not amazing only Google products are all amazing. If any one having problem with Google products then just sent a email to them or email me and they will give a quick response of the problem. If you don't want to send email or you don't know how to send email than email me your problem and I will send it to google. Love and thanks to Google.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a great app. It allows so much photos, the suggestions are terrific, it shows how smart it is. The app also let's you create slideshows and even order photos off of it. Photo albums too. The software recognizes faces and let's you search almost anything and it can recognize it. I took a photo of a friend's baby and the app grouped it with someone else's pictures. I thought it was a fluke but I looked closely and saw that person in a frame in the corner. Wow."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"UGH! The only reason I used this app was the sharing option. But for some reason, in the last few months, it won't let me see albums shared with me at all. It's full of bugs, searching is a nightmare, adding already uploaded photos to albums takes forever and I have to add a few at a time to make sure it doesn't miss any of my photos or videos. Super time consuming, frustrating and just an awful customer experience. Honestly, guys, you're freaking Google for crying out loud. Make an effort!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the little animations they send me, made from my own pictures... even add music to them! I honestly haven't messed around with the app a great deal? It's one of those apps that I like and benefit from, with just a surface knowledge. If I would take a bit of time to really get to know everything it does, bet I would be even happier with it! Love Google photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Nothing is free. It's a basic picture viewer with backup functionality. But since they disabled free storage for pictures and videos, this app isn't worth it anymore. The app doesn't let you disable video synchronisation, so the free backup storage is running out quickly. Is an easy task to disable videos, but that way they (Google) would never sell more space. Worst strategy ever, like drug dealers basically. Get something for free and let one buy more."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hands down the best photo service currently amongst icloud, Dropbox, amazon etc. Just works. It's even better if you take pics from multiple devices they all show up in the same place. Assistant is good too, but is more of a me too feature. Good basic editing features too. And many more that most users will never use. The sharing feature ie album sharing could do some more work. It's very confusing right now and not straightforward. It doesn't need to be so. The only other ask is to allow high res / original quality uploads. Highly recommended. Boo on Apple for not even coming close and asking so much money to do basic sync of photos across devices."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I really like this photo app but it doesn't have an option to gather all stickers into one album (Facebook messenger) and I find that ads from other apps are saved in my phone. It's annoying to have to go in every single day to delete video/picture ads from my gallery. Also I find it weird that some of my photos are saved under different folders and sometimes I have double folders. It makes me miss the old gallery from my previous moto g4 phone. Edit: I was scrolling back to show a friend some photos from summer only to find that some of them are broken. They show less than half the photo while the rest is grey. Now I'm wondering if I've lost these photos for good. I'm upset.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like the app alright. It syncs fine to my phone, but I wish it was better at syncing when I'm on a computer. Also, why can't it be set up so we can create sub-albums? I HATE that I can only create single albums. I'd like to have them by year, and then smaller albums within each year. Especially paying for storage, you'd think you could make that a feature..."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It is not very user friendly. Sharing albums or pictures with other Gmail users is a great idea, but the actual process to go through is somewhat clumsy. Also the folder sync is in need of a major revamp. It does not give you the option to delete a photo from google photos without deleting it from your device. And the work around is incredibly tedious. Also once a photo is added to a folder on your device, google photos will permanently remember it in that folder. So you cannot organize it later."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have always loved this app. But now, it's really ridiculous! I can't believe that Google would be so money-hungry as to limit the high resolution storage! I have been storing photos with you (Google) since like 2008. Maybe more. Then, you all have the 2GB storage plan for $99, one time, but then the next plan up is $49.99/month??? You must be out of your minds! That's so ridiculous! The app functions, itself, are cool, but the pricing? What's wrong with you? You're already making BILLIONS!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very good app for storing and organising photos. However, the face recognition thing is a bit hit and miss. Also, it would be nice to be able to group albums together in collections, and the ability to rearrange albums into an order of my own choosing would be nice. Maybe the ability to add a discription to the album would also be nice. But there are some great features, such as the auto animations and movies."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is a great app and I'm sure all the other reviews have gone over the good things about this app. However, I've given it 4 stars as often I'd open the app and just get kicked out after a couple seconds for no reason. Also, I have an album which i update daily and I've set it to 'most recently added' in the sort menu. The pictures still don't show up in this order and some are even out of the album which I never intended to remove which isn't good. Hope this gets fixed."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great User Interface! It's easy to navigate, organize, and use and it doesn't feel cluttered or overwhelming. Another great feature is the app's ability to sense when you are low on space, have photos that aren't backed up, or when you have copies of already saved photos and automatically suggest the solution! All a user has to do is press a button and the app with automatically work with your phone to sync photos, archive things, organize your photos by subject, and delete old copies!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a versatile app that allows storage of photos I take on my phone to be backed up onto Google Photos. There were times when I've accidentally permanently deleted photos on my phone, but it was gladly already saved in Google Photos. It's a life saver. Some downsides, not a great deal of trouble though, is that there's only 15GB of space, but I think you can purchase more, some automatically processed movies take so long to load. But still a great app!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is probably the only app I'll give 5 stars. First off, it's such a valuable free service, so much online storage of photos both for archival purposes and sharing. The ability to auto backup my photos is great, if anything catastrophic happens I'm not totally pooched. The interface is intuitive and works how you'd expect it. The face organization is borderline creepy, but super handy when I want to find a certain image. Really not much to complain about. No alternative comes close."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love all the google products! whenever a problem or error occurs, Google's alway's been there to help me resolve It and or take it upon themselves to fix the problem or error. I like my second option because that shows Google is all about customer service and making the customer happy. But If asked Im sure Google will do just that. I'm currently looking for an option to mass select duplicate images, files, folders, to delete. Can this be done?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like it, but it could be very messy! I'm a guy who creates albums for everything. And after a while want to dive into the album and delete pictures. However when you are in an album, you are only able to remove it from the album, but then the image would still exist. When removed it's almost impossible to find.. For me this is extremely annoying. Furthermore I do indeed like the app! But some things (like this) is just a classic UX problem which could be solved easily. Thanks for the app!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is great for organizing and sharing photos, no doubt. But I was really disturbed to discover just how unbelievably difficult it is to move my photos to a different app or to get access to them on my computer. It is virtually IMPOSSIBLE to move to another photo app and keep my photos with their dates and other metadata intact. This is nothing more than Google's gross display of corporate greed to keep people platform locked and unable to move while mining as much info as possible."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I tap ""Library"" at the bottom of the screen. Then I open any folder with pictures, open any picture. There's no star button to favourite the picture. When I tap ""Photos"" at the bottom of the screen, and then open a photo, there's a üåü button on the top of the screen, however most of the photos on my device cannot be found in the ""Photos"" view. A completely useless feature! In general, I also find the concept of ""Photos"" vs. ""Library"" very confusing and annoying."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I highly recommend google photos! It's free, its convenient and removes the hassle of low space clutter on your phone. I will say my favorite feature is the unlimited storage option, so I don't have to worry about having to purchase and add more space. I would give 5 stars but a feature they should've had already is if I organize photos to an album then it shouldn't show that photo in my library pool still, it should move it soley to the album. Makes it hard finding photos when their 1000+."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I don't use this app for backup. You'd be crazy to only trust a cloud backup. I use it for the insane AI and sorting. I can find any picture that is on here by just using a few key words or a person's name. I never have to guess the date, the place, or anything. I can search for ""car"" and all of my pictures with cars in them show up. It's great for sharing photos of shared events with other users. You can just add their entire album they made to your library, to fill the event from another view."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The default photo app on Android, but that's a good thing. There are prettier UIs out there, but in my book, features are more important than looking pretty. One of the most impressive is image lookup. Type in a person's name and it shows you photos with that person in it. I've needed my car's license plate before, and knowing that I had taken a photo of my car, I searched Photos for ""license plate"". And voila, I found the photo I took of my car. Plus, it's always a nice surprise when I get notifications with a collage or series of photos from years past that it's created."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's helpful! You can chose a picture if your choice, put it into a movie with music and keep the photo the same. You can also name albums that you want to keep safe. If you have pictures of people or pets, it sorts it out automatically, so you don't have to scroll through hundreds of photos to find a specific person. You can also edit a photos duration, lighting, and colors, and filters, so you have endless possibilities of color and hue to a picture."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app still functions after the redesign! It's nice. My only gripe is that the ""For You"" section seems to be replaced by the ""Recent Highlights"" section, and then creations saved from there has to be viewed in ""All Creations"" in order to be downloaded. It's a bit more complicated and conflicts with how Google Photos currently is like on the desktop site. Besides that, this app is great for backing up photos and videos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It would be much more user friendly if your phone's albums were actually imported. The app has great alternate organizational features, but none of them are as easy as just knowing what folder a picture has always been stored in and being able to quickly go there and find it. Even re-creating the albums through the app doesn't take them off the main page leaving so many pictures to sort through."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Google Photos is convenient when it actually works, but extremely frustrating to use the other 50% of the time -- when it is incapable of doing even the most basic of file transfers both locally and to/from cloud storage. Therefore, I've never fully trusted it to automatically backup my photos, so I usually end up doing that mundane chore myself, with a manual connection to my PC"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Junk! It come with the phone, the only photo gallery and it's junk. All kinds of unuseful things, constant updates, can't find what I'm looking for when I do look, no way to control the manager unless you shut it down. I didn't need another social app and that should be optional by choice to get the app. But like I said it came with the phone, so I'm stuck with it or my phone& other apps won't function properly. Rather put no star rating..."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app no doubt. But it also is a tiny bit messy for my taste. I don't know if you can turn off the option of the app automatically categorizing the images, but that is utterly annoying for me. Example: a picture of a dog, ends up in a folder the app creates named ""Things""... I like to put my images in folders I create, also so I know where what is. Also missing a sort option in folders, fx by date, size ect. The collage thing is meh, random without editing option."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After the latest update, backing up photos now takes forever and even before that, there is always a problem. The app would get stuck in a ""getting ready to back up"" loop. I've tried all the fixes from clearing caches, to clearing data, to deleting and reinstalling the app, and this fixes the problem for a while, but eventually something goes wrong again. For an app made by Google, this is a very disappointing app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have been using Google photos for many years and am quite happy to store pictures and videos for as long as I want. There are features to edit, filter, and make collages and sync with music to share on social media accounts. One of the best features of Google photos is to share memories of different events in life and make it special to remember good old days. I ‚ù§Ô∏è Google photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"As with everything else Google, products go from good to bad or terrible. A simple photos and sharing app is now driving me crazy. I appreciate the free storage, and the quick editing tools. But storage doesn't work simple enough. I transferred a shared album to my personal album. And they don't show up. Secondly, when I select multiple pics to post to Instagram, the feed option doesn't show up, only direct. Why? Basic things. Shared folders should show up as an easy list that is alphabetical."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Good news! The UI just got redesigned seemingly for no reason. Nothing is improved, just moved, and a new super annoying ""highlights"" was added which only seems to be in the way. Of course, none of the things I have hoped to see for years have been added or fixed. Were you imagining organizing your photos with the use of tags? Think again! Google Photos seems to try as hard as it can to prevent you from using albums as tags. This app is phenomenal at making you want something else."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The last update has left me unable to scroll through my photos. The app keeps closing itself. I emptied ALL photos and videos from the app, in a bid to troubleshoot the issue. This has not worked. I took 6 photos as a test. I still cannot navigate through the app. I take a lot of photos for my business. I love Google photos but my goodness, please please I am begging you...FIX IT!! In the meantime I will be uninstalling all recent updates...let's see what happens Thanks in advance"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app truly is amazing. My one issue though is that whenever I move a photo from one folder to the other, the timestamp updates. I don't understand the reason for this. This makes the photo appear in the wrong position (date section) both in the new folder, and on the photos tab I'd expect that it maintains the original timestamp and organizes itself accordingly."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Many great features, many more going. I use this for indexing a lot of photos, and I often change the filename to a description to make finding them easier. All was well until a while ago, and now the search feature will not return any results from the filename. The issue is that I've backed them up and deleted them from my phone, so I can't use the system search feature either. They try to peddle facial recognition and geotagging and remove the most basic search feature possible..."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Would give it 5 star but because device folders and albums on photos are so segregated, it becomes really frustrating and tedious having to manually make the albums so they sync to photos so I can access them anywhere, you have to add any new images manually too. When you sync, all the images jumble up and it's hard to know which were in the Instagram (device) folder or your camera roll for example. Even more frustrating since this is the only photo viewing app on my phone and it is very limited. This is an issue that's long overdue a fix up. Google, check your forums, you'll find a lot of annoyed users with the same issue too!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If you want this app to backup your photos, there are better ways. If your photos are organized in folders, backup does not preserve your folders. Instead, you have thousands of photos all together. If you ever have to restore them from the backup, you will have to sort them out one by one! That means creating new folders on your device, finding each photo individually, then adding them to your newly created device folders. Believe me or not."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app, but it's a little slow and has a harder time backing up your videos. Besides from backing up videos, this app works very well and has saved me a ton of storage. It's fun to go back and look at your photos and see them several years later. All of my photos are in one place, which is super helpful and overall Google Photos is a great app and I would suggest using it! :)"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You can't put photos into folders like you used to be able to. I have hundreds of thousands of pictures. How am I supposed to organize them? They are completely and totally unmanageable. If your photos are in albums on your phone, they'll be dumped into one location when they're uploaded. If you want to scroll back to like 2016 it will take about 45 minutes, IF you don't accidentally click back to today's date. You can't organize your photos in Drive anymore, either. They said that was too confusing. They could have added an advanced ""View Photos in Drive"" toggle to let superusers turn that feature on so we could easily move photos into folders, but they don't want you to be able to move your photos to a new service easily. It worked. I wish I'd used literally any other service. I hate Google Photos"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Since its inception, never have I used any other app for photos on my app. It's a wonderful app, with automatic backup. However, it could be much easier to use, if they had an option to organize the uploaded photos according to ther folder. I mean at the moment, I often struggle to find my snapseed folder once I remove them from the device."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"After using the app for a few months it's started to crash when editing a picture. It's now unusable as every other image crashes when saving an edited image. You have to close the app, force stop it and then retry just for it to happen again a couple of pictures later. I've come here to delete the app and have noticed an updated version so will give it a go. It's a shame as it's a nice and easy app that did the job perfectly."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Grateful for the free storage space. Found the app very useful and reasonably user-friendly, except for one thing. Wanting to reorganise my photos so they come in the order that I desire (this is important for me) rather than the deafault date-wise order can be a pain. The way to do that is rather clumsy and time-consuming. What is worse, sometimes it doesn't work either and the photos get jumbled up again after hours of painstaking work. Extremely frustrating. A lovely app, but for that flaw."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I cannot even begin to explain how much I love Google photos. It's super easy to use, very fast with uploading, easy sharing ability, and is super generous regarding the amount of free storage space from the start. Apple gives you barely any storage and then takes you hostage and charges ridiculous amounts for more space. I have years of photos on here and haven't used up my space yet and it's incredibly easy to setup on any new phone and keep your photos. Thank you Google!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've always loved the apps, been using for years. One feature I like is the album feature. So photos of my husband and I, I put in one album, photos of my daughter I put in another. It makes it easier for me to find photos that way. In the past I use to be able to select multiple photos to transfer to particular albums. Since an update has been made that is no longer an option so it takes longer to transfer photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Very good and fast. Duplicate checking is incredible. But Flickr has more organizing features. 1)We have option to sort photos or videos in an Album but Please add option to sort Albums by name or any order that we can customize. 2)Please give us an option to search for photos that were never not added to an Album.3)Please add option to show the number of Photos and Videos in the Album like Flickr, right it just shows the total combined. 4)Please give us a ""Where used""option for each photo/video, so that we know which Album it is used"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Google Photos. Apart from being able to store and access my photos from different devices, I have to say that the photo editing tools are just great. It's unbelievable some of the edits that can come out from the basic editing tools. üëåüëåReally like the additional features it's been bringing such as the highlights and the photo map. I like using the vignette feature but not being able to apply it to other margins if the focus falls on one side can be a downside."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The product is great but there are a lot of issues with synchronization in the app. The website works fine. I keep on having these issues where I add photos in an album, get a message saying they have been added, go back to list albums only to find out the photos were not really added! This is very annoying. I always end up tracking the photos that were not properly synced and upload them manually. Then from the web I add them to the album. Hope you can fix this issue."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is app is such a mess. It's extremely and unnecessarily complicated, does not let you pick and choose where you want pictures to go and it takes them away, never to be seen again. Automatically backing up photos is nothing new and is a nice feature but this app doesn't even do that right. Only problem I've had with the Pixel 3 so far is this IS the photo app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Everything is quite excellent except for the difficulty in finding the desired album when adding some pictures to it, as everytime after selecting the photos you have to search for the albums manually by scrolling down. If there is an album searching option while adding photos/videos to the desired albums then it would have been easier and a lot more convenient for us to use Google Photos. Hopefully this option will be added to Google Photos to make the app more user friendly. Thanks."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love this app.. now it seems to have a mind of it's own, and works when it pleases. With the last few updates it has become less helpful and more frustrating. I am removing it until it gets better. I was able to cast videos to chromecast without issue until this last update. Now it only plays for maybe 10 minutes and stops casting. It also pauses the video if the app is minimized."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love it because one, it automatically backs up my photos, and as someone who has lost photos before because of a device breaking down or corrupting, this means the world to me. Then two, I love being able to search for specific things whether it be people, pets, objects, or other things. It's saved me so much headaches I could've had like when searching for things I need as reference for something at work because it recognizes practically anything in a picture."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was pleasantly surprised at how good this app is. You just open it and your photos will start backing up. Its REALLY smart and can organize your photos based on what/who they are. (Face recognition is great, and it can also organize things like sunsets and ""palaces"" instead of ""sky"" and ""building."" Face and object recognition is perfect) One of the nicest features to me is that itll send notifications of ""__ years ago today/this week"" & you can look back on old memories. I love it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There has been an on-going issue since 2017 where videos are successfully uploaded, and deleted from the device, only to have the video file be unable to play later. ""Cannot Play Video"" on the mobile app, and, ""An error has occurred, please try again later."" Any attempt to download the file results in, ""file not found."" Since this bug has been around so long without any acknowledgement from Google, I've tried EVERY suggestion to get my videos back. None of them have worked. UNINSTALLING."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing! It not only stores all my photos, but also, automatically organizes them by date. It allows you to organize them in albums. The search feature is unbelievable. You can search by person, place, city, day, month, year, or by specific words like party, ballet, swimming, beach, trees, document, screenshot, videos. It also makes movies, edits photos, combines photos of the same person a long time ago and now, and you have the option to keep or dicard them. I absolutely love it!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tried it out and was very disappointed to discover that you can't delete photos from the cloud without them being deleted from your device as well. Far too invasive and you potentially risk losing precious photos to boot. I set this up because I wanted to back up thousands of photos on my phone dating back years, but when they initially didn't organise properly (an issue on my end, wrong dates) I was just about to go ahead and delete them all from the cloud and start again - a process that would've totally wiped them all from my phone as well, for good. The only way I could find to get them out of Google photos while keeping them on my phone was to turn off sync and revoke permission to access storage, which just renders the app useless anyway. It literally doesn't let you in unless you give it permission to potentially delete photos from your device. Hard pass."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love how they go the extra mile and make movies, animations, etc. for you. True, some of the movies are a bit hokey (that music, though! üòÇ), and there are times when the images get the cropped wonky, or face recognition gets confused, but it's pretty awesome how far tech has come just the same. One suggestion would be to make it easier to replace an image from a pre-made movie without having to do the whole thing yourself from scratch, but honestly, I can't complain!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the app and almost everything from Google. Two things that would make it better are more photo editing tools with a huge variety of options like a lot of the other photo editor apps. Also, the ability to lock certain albums with a passcode and a generic cover photo, just in case someone gets access to your phone or tablet etc and there is certain pictures youd rather them not see. Add those two things please!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This one of my favorite apps. Automatic back up of selected folders and the ability to select ""Back Up Only on Wifi"" is great. Unlimited Storage of HQ images is crucial. I work with thousands of images over multiple devices. It's nice to have everything available and organized for any situation. There are some organizational issues that could be addressed but, still great overall. The automatic creations can be repetitious and some photos don't turn out great but, I do keep a few. Thanks"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This application is good for viewing photos, but there is something unsual happening with large size files in download folder. suddenly it gots deleted after 2-3 days period of time. i have downloaded many videos file so that i can watch later on during travel and outings but it all get removed magically, it was a complete waste of time and effort that i have done for searching and downloading those data"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"If you don't have Google Photos, I truly feel bad for you. But that's okay, 'cause you can easily change that by tapping that 'install' button!!! This app is ESSENTIAL for high-quality photo storing, sharing, and organizing. Without Google Photos, I probably would have stored less than half of the good memories I've taken in pictures and video. Not to mention, it's free (for at least a couple years, and then it's pretty inexpensive after that)"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. My phone doesn't have a regular photo gallery, so I didn't have much of a choice, but I pleasantly surprised. I do, however wish they had more editing options for my photos & videos. The unlimited storage is wonderful & allows me take all the photos & videos I like, without fear of running out of space to keep them. The assistant is a nice feature that most other apps lack & it's pretty helpful too. Plus, it allows me to easily share pics & videos with my family friends."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"it is undoubtedly a great opportunity to store all your pics. In addition, the suggested GIFs are cute and many times successful. However, it is quite irritating that one cannot access the pics from various apps (such as diaries or instant messenger). It is too clumsy and annoying. What is more, in the mobile version the layout is not quite readable (not listed the date itself unlike in the desktop version)"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"There are many reasons to love Google Photos, and few reasons not to. I particularly love being able to search my photos with keywords and having all of the photos of the important people and pets in my life automatically sorted. I would like to see them add some editing options (like the colorize feature that they announced a while ago) but I'd still highly recommend the app in its current state."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Not so long ago I lost all my photos stored on the phone as i could not unlock it, and during that time i regretted so much, for knowing everything about google photos for so long and still not using it, finally lost all the dear photos of friends and family. now lesson learned 1. Save your photos in lower quality for ever. 2. Save unlimited amount of photos and videos for ever in lower quality. 3. sync the phone with the software so that all the photos are regularly uploaded."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This is the only photo program available on the Google phone. It can be difficult to find photos. Sometimes they end up in the cloud and not available on the device. Sometimes they are on the device. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to which location takes priority and features to move/download photos are not always present. Google falls short with this. I miss the ease of use of iPhone's photo app.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is indeed the best and most reliable photo app. Things that need to be added in the app:- 1. Feature to rotate photos with two fingers rotation gesture. It will be very convinient. 2. Whenever I select some photos then click send but I had to click delete (or any other options), then if I go back all photos are deselected so I had to do it all over again. 3. Photos can't be zoomed enough. I use my phone for education purposes mostly, whatsapp photos can't be zoomed to touch the inside edges."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have always loved Google products. This one is still very good. But there are a few things I find annoying. -In order to crop your photos now, you have to use markup and save the photo and sometimes it just disappears. -also, sharing doesn't always work. Sometimes the picture I share goes through but I usually have to send a few times. But those are the only things I can think of.. otherwise a typical amazing Google application!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Creating an album on your phone automatically syncs all content to the cloud, even with backup and sync turned off. It does this with no warning and absolutely no way to stop the process once it has started. I'm now sitting here watching my phone upload hundreds of photos and gigabytes of video without my consent, taking up all my bandwidth and absolutely draining my battery. Deleting the album off the phone doesn't stop the process, and turning off data, wi-fi, or the phone only delays it until"

All the photos & videos that i recently uploaded are lowered in quality after uploading. I even checked multiple times between the same files that were present both in my device and google drive. They were also decreased in size like from 100mb to 97. Where's the option to choose between the quality of photos & videos (ex Original, Low) to be saved when uploaded in the drive?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is honestly so bad. Things I archive reappear. It reorganizes the photos in my albums without permission, even when I try to organize them the way I want. When I try to add photos to albums the albums aren't listed alphabetically. The whole user experience is just so bad, whether I'm on Android or my computer. I don't even know who designed this."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I think that this is very helpful but it's also very frustrating at the same time because there is many things that are capable of doing but then again they are very limited. Issues are : 1. Not capable of recognizing duplicate copies 2. can't really fully organize and separate types of Media (photos, video, animation, and others) 3. No longer have an automatic sync up to Google drive That's not really all as more time passes it's only becoming worse. I will appreciate some feedback on fixing"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Nice app to have photos with you all the time and even like the stylised photos that come through. Would like to be able to correct or reduce the eye reflection from the flash as sometimes the animals look a little weird. Would love to do some basic smart edits on the movies. For example, change sections of the clip from portrait to landscape view to make easier to view on device."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I think this is by far the best app for your pictures collection. For one, all the pictures are backed on the google cloud. Secondly, there are nice preset edit options which are very usable and add more life to the pictures. Then there are some nice surprises by the assistant in the form of collages/ pics with effects/ pictures to archive, etc. etc. The assistant is very intuitive, I must say, one can definitely make this their primary photo app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely hate this app! I can't view some photos because I'm off line, I can't combine albums, it's always asking me to delete old photos, blurry photos, duplicates and screenshots. I didn't realize it had an auto delete which I had to go turn off! Who knows what pictures were deleted automatically. When I tried to move pictures to another album it would just copy it rather than moving the picture! So then I get a pop up asking if I want to buy storage. My cell doesn't have its own gallery!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I no longer fear losing my phone with photo backup, which is worth this app just for that. I love pretty much everything about this app, and my criticisms are mostly nits. First, I wish I had options to sort my albums (by name, by date, last modified, created, etc). Second, a huge improvement would be around editing photos: being able to save as copy or keep the changes in history, easier one click rotation, especially for photos that are not on the phone's physical storage."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I consider myself a basic user of the tool. I take photos and I don't really care how organized they are or even how good they came out. Google Photos seems to fullfil these two hurdles of having hundreds or even thousands of pictures in your life. I also like the movies it makes for you and I love the the lighting and stylizing feature.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Hello Google :) I love The photos app, it's the best place to store all my picture and video. My request is in reference to this app, Google photos lacks behind by one feature that is Video editing, it's something that I wish Google works on, having an option to add filters, stickers, effect, crop and also to trim the videos would be an amazing things. I hope to update the app with these features. Thank you :)"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love all Google products but this one is definitely a favorite of mine. 2 great features about this app: - Sorting by face, it's incredibly accurate. - Search photos by describing whats in the picture. For instance, you can search ""red dress"" and all pictures that contain a red dress will be shown. The bad: I wish you could merge or delete duplicate photos but that is my only complaint. Bottom Line: I've been using this app for years and it's become so amazing, I highly recommend!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"don't get me wrong, i love the app. however there are a few confusing things. may i request that it can be the same as a standard gallery where you can find default albums of everything you have uploaded? it's kind of difficult to go around the app and you can't seem to move a picture from one folder to another without it being duplicated. i can't find a specific photo so i would have to scroll down everytime. hope you fix this."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love all google programs and apps. Absolutely essential, and your not even aware until something happens, and you be lose them: ""(two step verification, after two phones are stolen and you do not have access), can not verify even if new tablet is put on same account, and know all passwords and safety questions?""... So, always have back-up phone and e-mail!!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Thank you Google! It's reassuring to know that all my photos are automatically backed up, handy for when my phone has died and photos become inaccessible. Edit -These days I often find that the photos don't always load straight away. And sometimes the library section is blank, no folders appear. I have cleared the cache and uninstall the app multiple times and they will sometimes show but it appears to be random. Furthermore screenshots are now saved automatically from android without choice."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The last time I updated all my photos got out of order. Like for the month of August it shows 1 photo, July shows photos from 2020, what happened to photos from July 2021??? Really, I travel fulltime up & down the coast, take a lot of photos. Where the heck did they go. Now I'm getting a notice to upgrade everytime I open photos. I really don't think so!!!!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like photos and the automatic creations are cute and fun, the little movies it makes are sometimes great, but I photograph and record everything so sometimes boudoir shots seem strange in a compilation of city or vacation shots around town. Also the phone keeps telling me to delete photos since they are backed up, but if you delete them from the app, it deleted the backups as well so take care how you remove your photos from your device. Overall I love the photo app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The new photo editing touch-up controls are horrific and impossible to use. Everything is just shifted to these really zoomed in individual controls and I hate it. Before you could control everything and see a very clear visual of everything that was done to the photo. Now you have to jump from setting to setting and it's absolutely terrible. No good UX designer would do this. Change it back to the original.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Super frustrating trying to save photos and videos. Says ""saved"" and it's no where to be found. It would be much better if you could select where you're saving to and if it would actually save. Despite having full battery and trying multiple connections, no improvement on that function. Also, not all videos and photos come up when entering a simple date or year in the search box."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I expect more from Google, but it's okay I guess. This app is good, but lacks features. The huge feature that's missing is the ability to hide/lock photos/albums. You can archive, but that only hides from the main album, it will still show up in other places and thumbnails. When in an album, you can't pinch to zoom in/out like you can in the main section, which makes it hard to find pictures. It's great how cloud storage works and how easy it is to access my photos from any device though."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I no longer lose important, sentimental, and/or priceless photos and videos since I've downloaded Google photos to all of my devices. And the free up space option in the menu backs up and clears space from my devices at the same time. It suggests and makes collages w like photos and videos, even groups photos by key words or faces...It's amazing and I've recommended it to all of My Fam and Friends and they all use it now as well üòäüòç. Thanks Google Photos!!!!!!!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the way it captures and saves all of my media and I don't have to worry about backing up or losing my device. I love the way you can make albums and sort out photos and various ways. The utilities allow you to make collages, movies, slideshows and so much more and share them easily. The way it does facial recognition and can search for individuals or pets or places or things is absolutely brilliant. Can't imagine it being much better actually."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Its been fixed. I find that if I am out of date and not current with updates this pops up again. However it is nothing like it was. The grouping tools are awesome too. I have lots of animals and often need a photo of an individual one, it recognises the differences in my dogs, or horses. It's great! I'm having issues with it not automatically uploading my videos. when I go in individually it says they are uploading... but it's been days..."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"For a while, I saw Google Photos as nothing more than an alternative to my system's default photo gallery app. Now I see it as so much more though. It is helpful to have photos backed up to the cloud to free up space on my phone. The intelligent features in the app are very helpful at times. It is great to be able to search my photos by location, by person, or (as I just found out) by object! The facial recognition is not perfect, but it is very good!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The best way to keep and organize photos. Plenty of user options and controls to customize your albums. Time stamps,location, and more. Gives you the control to go between internal drive,external,and linked drives and includes backup. If you have a lot of photos that cover a wide range of subjects/details. Then look no further. Look forward to future add ons from everything google!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Pretty good, but the problem is that if you switch phones or restore a phone from a backup it will think all your images and videos you have are new ones and back them up twice. Since there is no tool that will detect these duplicates, you will then have to manually go through thousands of pictures and delete them. This is rather annoying if you want to keep the originals locally stored, especially on a new device."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"A few issues have come up. I cannot use the ""free up space"" option. The app just closes or freezes when I click on it. Also, I ALWAYS have things backing up. Once in a while I will open the app and it will say ""backup complete"" but then one second later it says it's backing up 600 items. I have the setting set to backup using data. I have unistalled and reinstalled the app twice."

The photos don't go to the trash or back to downloads folder, they're just gone. I tried checking the option to back up the folder to see if that would keep it safe multiple times; didn't work. Checked online to try to find a solution and saw I'm not the only one and support didn't provide a solution. Please do something about it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is my primary app for backing up photos into my storage. I like the new features (the photo editings), and generally, the entire app. Although, one thing I've been constantly noticing is that sometimes, when I try to edit or download an image, it tells me ""Unable to edit, check your connection."" It's really frustrating because I have 0 issues with my connection expect for on Google Photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I loved the idea of not worrying about space because I use my gallery to download pictures of kpop groups/idols that I love, hence why I downloaded this app. There are some issues that make it unusable for me though. The first is the lack of ability to sort multiple albums within an album. I put all the albums that relate to one specific group in one album, but I can't do that with google photos. I've also noticed that some of my gifs don't work in google photos. All in all, a disappointment."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So, so Whist it does the function of backing up and keeping imagines safe, it just shoves all the photos into one folder/feed. If you have folders on your phone, it does not create them in google photos. It copies some to library, but only if you are synching/backing up. If you decided to free up space on your phone, then all the folders just vanish and everything is in one. So to find a screen shot you have to scrolls through 100 of photos, same for other sources. Your email isnt monitored."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Enjoyed the app for storing and navigating photos. The automatic created movies and animation are good. The app is lacking much customization for the users, it's trying to do what it think is best for you. If you try to create a movie in the app for example, there is 0 customization. It won't even tell you how long the video will be while being edited before it's processed. And most of all the app mess around with the aspect ratio and sizing of the is the final video that's it's shareable."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Uninstalled app and reinstalled and it's back to normal. I like that have choices to change lighting, color, darken or lighten background. Lastly, the ability to pop the picture more of less. Went to other apps and could use only what they had for color, brightness and could not change from lighter or darker background. Here's a quote, ""if it's not broken don't fix it""."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall the responsive time is great and its very eager to get the job done. But at the rate it goes its hard to understand all the settings but i deffinetly would love to master them. I really need to talk to my girlfriend and have her help me figure it out or not. Shes great with these types of things. When talking of deceptive ads, i believe it may, i will just see if deleting them works"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The service the provide to backup all your photos and videos at no cost is just awesome. But the app is a little buggy. I tried leaving my phone to backup all night only to realize it didn't do anything. Also once I thought clearing app data was the solution to an issue that I couldn't get the app to backup some files, and then it just got the app to crash itself a while after opening each time, forcing me to go through my gallery and delete some media somewhat corrupted until app didn't crash."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, I'm impressed with the app. The main reason I downloaded it was for the backup and flexibility of that feature. The stylized photos the app creates are amazing. And the panoramas I've had created form 7 photos are flawless. You cannot tell that it's not one photo. Impressive! As far as printing an image is concerned, I imagine if you can share to a printer, it should work. Aside from that, I could not find a print function, but I do not have a printer driver & printer installed."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google Photos is the only photo app that we consider a necessity for any mobile device. If you‚Äôve ever lost all your media files when your phone died or was misplaced, you‚Äôll understand why. While it only has minimal editing tools, Google Photos organizes your photos and videos, offers easy sharing and ‚Äî most importantly ‚Äî automatically backs up your entire image library to the cloud. From there, it seamlessly syncs to all your devices where the app is installed. That includes Apple phones, laptops, tablets and desktop computers; Windows computers, and all Android devices."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"So buggy! There is a huge ""lag"" on things like comments. For example: you'll get a push notification saying someone commented on a photo, but when you go to the feed, it's not there. Maybe it'll show up by the next day if you're lucky. It's also kind of hard to figure out how to select and add photos to/ from your different albums. If they could work on these issues it would be perfect."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It was perfect, but after one of the latest updates you removed the ""Edit in"" button, which was annoying, but I could still get to it through usual editing. But now it wouldn't even let me edit my photos, because the connection is bad? I am on home WiFi, the connection is perfect, and editing any pictures has never been an issue before, even offline. It's really frustrating not to be able to edit 90% of my library (downloading the pictures did not help). Please fix this."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Google, listen to me. This is the most annoying apps that I ever have by default. This apps should work properly to back up the photos/videos that we have synced on. But when I delete the photo on my phone, the photo on this apps that it is SAID has already backed up. It also get deleted. So basically this apps really needs to get a lot of re-work. Make it more useable and this is not user friendly"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is fine for the most part. My issue is I had a folder on my device that I spent hours renaming pictures and organizing. I didn't realize the folder was in the backup and so when I saved and deleted my pictures off my phone, the folder went as well and I can't get that back. It's unfortunate that Photos doesn't save folders as well. Just frustrated with this."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's wonderful being able to access your photos on different devices and knowing they are backed up even if you lose your phone. I love the albums that go back in time to what you were doing this same week 2 and 3 years ago. The search features and suggested photo albums are helpful, too. The tools for correcting photos can be a bit difficult to use."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have used Google Photos since I started using gmail. Since then I have had years of enjoyment categorizing my photos and videos into albums, folders and files. It has allowed me to organize all of my digital data which includes documents in a .jpg format into a organized system. Doing so has made it possible to find any photo, video or document easily. Before I just had to look through several folders before getting to the right one to find the file contained within it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. I do wish however that you had an option to see the photos not in albums. As well as... *****this is the most frustrating part of Google Photos for me.....***** A DUPLICATE PHOTO FINDER. I have over the years managed to accumulate multiple copies of the same photos and I have yet to find a way to erase the extra copies and leave the original. Other than that, this app is awesome."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is my second Pixel (Pixel 3XL). the main thing that made me go for this was the photos (and the ability to choose what apps I want on my phone.) I really like that my photos are kept backed up, organized, and it's easy to share them. Google may not be perfect, but they show a knack for identifying what we really want & need to work well- and making it do that..."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love how it organizes your pictures and videos by date and time. You get quality pictures that you can either edit, crop, change, filter, or almost anything, very easily. You can make slideshows, videos, share directly with friends and family and post to your social media. Anytime you no longer have a picture, or video, in that old phone, I love that it easily backs it up and saves to your email. Good job Google!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app seems to be going downhill fast. It was nice to be able to browse what was stored locally, and delete easily what you didn't want to store locally anymore. Now it is all or none. I cannot choose what to leave locally Just erase all locally. I want to keep the files locally on a few apps but want to back up the files. Not to mention the clock is ticking on using this as ""free"" storage. Once you are hooked, seems you do as they say. This seems to be the trend with Google, to keep removing services, and consolidating and incorporating them into another app like was done with Google Music to YouTube Music. Totally inferior experience. And now the service will become pay as you go which will call for ever increasing amount you pay as you continue to store photos with them. Have to add that, with the removal of monitoring local storage, I connected the phone to a PC and deleted 1000s of locally stored photos., a few gigabytes. App still shows the SAME number of files I need to remove. Even after clearing the cache, it still says that I need to remove the same files to reclaim the space. Had to clear entire data, and tell the app again which folders to back up. Was the removal of a simple feature really worth in Google?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This app does some things I don't like. I wanted to copy some photos to another folder but leave them intact in the original folder. It changed the date and moved them out of order. Very frustrating and disappointing. I don't mind having duplicates. I just wanted to organize them in a separate folder. I hate this app. I hate that it changes the date when you move photos to another folder.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Google Photos used to be great. However, I noticed that new features added in the past one or two years tend to be buggy. For example, the small iconic preview of the videos does not work properly on my phone: it often flashes, and thumbnails of one video appear on top of another. Uploading videos is also a pain: the videos are usually not ready for download on PC after uploaded from my phone. It always says the video is being processed. I had to wait for tens of minutes or hours sometimes. I don't know what Google is doing with the video upon uploaded, maybe running ML algorithms for annotations, but why prevents users from downloading it since it is already uploaded? The same issue happens if I upload a video to Google Drive. A more recent feature is showing groups of photos 1-3 years ago. When I click on one group, it automatically goes to slideshow, which is fine. However, I don't like the full screen: I keep clicking on the lower-left corner of my phone to exit it, but the ""back"" button is not there and the screen simply goes to the next picture. I don't know about others, but it is anti-intuitive to me."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"App needs A LOT of work. I. confused as to what the difference between stared and loved items. I couldnt find either anywhere! I had to go back and re-star things and even then everything kept disappearing. It was so frustrating. Also, I can only heart some images and star others. Never the two. It is a horrible system and should be fixed. I do love that it stores a lot of pictures and is a reliable place to keep pictures. just to be sure, I always store my pictures in two places."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The backup feature is amazing, and makes it easy to access photos from different devices. However, it's a bummer that even if you pay for high quality photo storage, any use of the editor will crush the quality of a photo to the size of the free version. I thought I would be able to upload DSLR pics from my laptop and leisurely sort them and tweak lighting on my phone, or even from the website on pc. Nope! Not unless I want to defeat the purpose of using a real camera."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app lacks the most basic filters and editing tools that should be expected with any phone gallery app, especially considering it cannot be uninstalled. At times, it fails to recognize photos cropped in the app, displaying only a black image instead of the cropped image. It needs to be able to be uninstalled from its installation packages."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Satisfactory, not superb. Ever since i switched to google photos on my phone, they take forever to send in a text, if they send at all. It will typically tell me not sent and ill have to resend 2 or 3 times before it will finally go. Also very annoyed with how it wont save changes when i edit or crop or rotate a photo. I have to go into the pics settings to save it. Could be better. Biggest issue is not sending in texts."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm honestly getting annoyed at this app. For this being the default app for my phone, it's lacking some key features such as sorting my albums. And within those albums you cannot sort either. And upon updating, they have once again cleared my bookmarked photos. I could find a better photo gallery app in my toilet. The one positive is that you can look at your photos. But good luck finding a specific one in a timely manner or doing anything beyond that."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely LOVE this app!! I have over 8,000 pics and videos that date back alot of years and every time I either need another phone or I want to upgrade, it saves EVERYTHING,and I have pics that if I lose them, I'll never get them back!! With this app every time I DID change phones, I'm not worried at all about losing those pics and videos!! Plus I love all the extras that this app does...makes little collages, videos, etc...probably the best app that I've got, and I'll always keep it!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app was so good and unique. But after the updates, it just went downhill. It backed up my pictures to my secondary account without my permission and if I delete the picture from my secondary account, it deleted it from my main gallery. Moreover there are some pics which are just shown as a blank and do not load. Also the month wise sorting is completely faulty. They are completely mismatched but the details of the pic shows otherwise. Please improve it ASAP.."

(i.e. the cloud icon in the upper corner of the photo thumbnails to let you know if a photo is backed up or not). It made managing your backed up photos so much easier! Now you have to guess, unless you choose to have everything backed up to your account (including all your useless and junk photos). At least make it an option to turn on or off! This isn't rocket science Google!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Very very very good app to store online your media. Recently a bug has occurred: zooming out dates and years are misplaced.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"As someone that has a TON of photos that I've gathered from online and my own personal collections, I need a place to store and organize them all in one spot, and Google photos fits that bill perfectly. It's not PERFECT, I've noticed a issue where some photos show up by the date they were originally taken instead of the date I downloaded them, but it's not the end of the world and I can probably fix it in my settings somewhere. No major issues with it thus far"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The 3 problems I have are when the photo of someone's face is in the wrong face id folder, you can't move them to another one or create a new one. Second is if you take burst photo, you should be able to make an animation out of it, if you can do that than my phone just won't let me. I miss being able to correct red eyes in my phone's own editor rather than having to download some 3rd party thing that puts a watermark. If these 3 issues were addressed then 5 stars, otherwise I love the app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app doesn't sync and isn't as reliable as it used to be. There's too many things going on in the background that slows down the functionality of the app. When I scroll to older pictures, it fails to load, and when I want to download them, it fails to download (even after uninstalling and installing the app). I'm afraid I'm losing my precious pictures that I synced with Photos all these years."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"So much mixed. I really, REALLY need: (1) a ""select all"" or other more powerful multi-select within an album. (2) The ability to change the order displayed of both albums and photos. (3) The ability to view the photos as files, which they are, with file names, sizes, dates modified/created, etc. Also, the auto-sync sometimes does VERY strange things while managing albums on my phone. But I couldn't be without it, and I don't know of an alternative."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The save space feature is great. I love the organization. It's so easy to find pictures. You can search by typing flowers, a certain person, food etc. Because it saves to the cloud picture is a breeze when changing devices. The automatic collage maker and video clips of my child growing up that it automatically does is wonderful. I have nothing negative to say."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is ok, but could be SOOOO much better! I don't understand why when making my albums I can't do basic things like arrange the photos in the order that I want. Sometimes chronologic order is not best. Or to be able to add captions or comments. You want to remember where these pictures were taken, etc. For such a large program, the offerings are very basic"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I know many people have said that the interface is easy to use but I find it difficult to distinguish between photos/videos that have been automatically saved and those that haven't. Apparently any photo/video that I take with my Android is automatically saved but screenshots and downloads have to be saved manually. That's perfectly fine, I just wish it had been specified during the introduction. Otherwise, I truly appreciate the service of being able to save and archive my favorite photos.:)"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love Google photos. Especially because it takes memories and captured moments and turns them into animations and videos and collages without you even asking. I find that so amazing. I get to see things and remember days from years past. It always makes me smile to visit Google Assistant. Plus it's great that it saves all of your photos and doesn't use that much gigabytes. It's great if you have too many photos on your device and it automatically saves them once you have Wi-Fi. In short I love Google photos. I don't know what I would do without it. It has saved me from so many potential mishaps.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The ""Albums"" feature is difficult and tedious to use, and I can't figure how to make a folder. Also, it's pretty strange and inconvenient that you need wi-fi to access your photos and look at them. However, I like the ""Stylized Photo"" and ""Animation Features,"" those bump it up a star. Overall, this app needs some huge improvements."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Awesome. It's awesome but it sometimes deletes the pictures that are on my phone too, (I think it's something to do with the settings), and another problem I'm having is that the pictures won't load without internet connection. Overall awesome way to save some space for people who have way too many photos and also helps in making collages and other stuff."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Extremely convenient app, so happy that I can use it. It automatically uploades all the media files and not only stores them, but keeps the folders, and sorts them out for even further convenience! Moreover, it makes collages, videos, etc all on its own, and I don't even bother to recheck what's stored, or not, it suggests to delete the files that are securely stored from the phone memory automatically!!! That's dope indeed! So thankful to the developers! (*ÀòÔ∏∂Àò*)"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Wow finally i can search for text stored within the photos. This is brilliant. The utility of the application makes it one of my most used applications. (5 stars before the UI fix) Latest UI update: (1 star due to the bad UI) It's clumsy and unclear where the for you section went. The distinctions were so clear in the previous version of the app. I like the map view but overall it's a very bad UI experience
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app does it's job & is easy to use, plus it's free. I have only two problems. 1. I can't organize photos in the order I want. They're always listed in the order they were taken/uploaded. 2. The app automatically creates folders for photos from Snapchat, Camera, Messages, and more. STOP. I don't need all those folders. Just one big list of photos is perfect. That way I don't have to hunt through several folders if I don't remember where the photo came from. I do like the album feature though"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"google photos is great, but feels a little unfinished. It doesnt feel like a very ""native"" app. for example, screenshots you take on your phone are difficult (or impossible?) to access from the web version on a computer. not very intuitive organization of photos, but perhaps as I keep using it I'll come to love it. i really enjoy how it recommends photos from the past to you, and it will automatically edit great montages and beautiful photos for you."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The Google Photo Assistant is the most delightful thing ever, but the tech problems with the photos app in general started in August 2018 and have continued to frustrate me. I have almost 28,000 photos, videos, & screenshots stored in here and don't know how to move them to a safer place. The most common problem is the app disobeying the settings I have chosen. Nothing more frustrating than double-checking the settings and seeing they aren't controlling app behavior. It has a mind of its own!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the Google Photos app. I love the features. The animations are so neat, so are the collages. Sometimes the app will take one of my pictures and remove all the background color, and enhance the subject so it really stands out, and it is awesome! It also made a short animation of my 3 year old niece from the pictures I've taken of her since she was a baby. It's really amazing. This app does so many helpful and really great things. I'm happy I switched from the Amazon Photos app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've pretty much given up on my ""real"" camera for the one that's always in my pocket. Most of photography is being in the right place at the right time with a camera in your hand, and Google Photos on my Pixel 6 makes it happen. Simple as a point and shoot but more adjustable than most SLR's, it helps you make better pictures. Not enough light? Night Mode will get the shot you want. Time Exposures? Motion Blur? There's a setting for that. Panoramas? 360? Check! Video? Yeah. It's got it all!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is driving me insane. I've used the app before and it was awesome. For some reason, the animations do not work at all ...I tried to make a video with the app and took an hour editing with all my videos to make one big one to send of my daughter...and i saved it and it's nowhere to be found . I doubt know what I'm doing wrong or if you can help? None of the animations I make or the site makes work..."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm glad to see the option of moving items to trash within an album has been added. A big plus. I would use the app even more if I were able to have an option to directly download memories . When I see my memories, all I can do is share them but not download them. Also, if I were able to multi select photos/videos and download them. Rather then having two individually go to each video or photo and download them that way. Also there isn't an option to SELECT ALL when adding/moving photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Nice app. Good way to back up your photos. I like the album feature. They are always there when you need them. The edit feature is nice. I like the Chromecast slide show feature but the algorithm is bad because it keeps showing the same pictures over and over again when there are hundreds that are never shown. Also if I delete a photo from Photos it should not delete it from my phone. Certain filles are supposed to be kept separate.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this app! I love it when Google Photos would create a stylized photo, short movie clips, and create gif images from your album. It also has a smart AI that creates a photo album for you while you travel and take photos. I went on a week vacation and took photos and it organized all the photos and the locations in an album. What app does that? Very nice! It also backs up all your photos and videos to the cloud so you can save storage on your phone without worrying about losing your memories!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been an iCloud user, used other apps in the past and have almost lost all my memories due to mandatory subscriptions,etc. Google photos has always been there to save them. It's always a relief being able to go back 9 years and see how my family began. Priceless. Excellent app, love the assistant too, combining precious memories that can draw a tear. No matter if I've had a Google phone, iphone or Samsung, Google photos has worked very well and freed memory on my phone when it's too full."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have been using this app for years and love it. However, like other users have an issue that has started happening recently. When trying to access options for an individual photo (either swiping up on a photo or clicking the 3 vertical dots button) the app crashes with a message saying that an error occurred during installation and should reinstall the app. OnceI reinstall it works again for a short time then starts crashing again when I try to select options on an individual photo."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I lost an important video. I had deleted it by mistake and when I restored it from the recycle bin, I ended up with a corrupted file. I tried to download it again. But to no use. I tried various video converters as well but none would load the file. The ones that did either said file header is corrupt or would show no/missing/corrupted codec for video and audio. That was a very important video related to my work as well. So losing that file was one of the worst things that has happened to me yet"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Well, I do love google pics. I dont care for how once you put a pic in an as album it's still in the ""picture"" section section. It's so messy. Plus it's always wanting to ""archive"" my pics of documents and screenshots. Just because it's not a person's face doesnt mean it's not important to me. Stop asking me. The suggestions to ""clean up"" make it too easy to accidentally delete/archive. I love how it backs it all up. It works great with snapbridge camera app. Transferred Samsung S9 easily."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Not great. First off, you need an internet connection to view all your photos, which is not great. Second, the free space offered in the cloud isn't really that much. Once in the cloud not all photos can be downloaded back to device, which is kind of a big deal. Downloading photos back from the cloud files are compressed/smaller. Would be nice to have a lock feature/vault for private photos. One thing I do like about it is, many of my photos would have been lost to time without it, so..."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This gets a solid 5 stars from me. I love the options available on Google Photos. I've used the search by name, face, date, location, and even theme features to find the photos I need. I have thousands of photos stored so these options are important to me! Another thing I love is that it suggests and creates movies and slideshows of my photos when I take several at once. Equally important is the ease of sharing albums."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This app is great. You can see all your photos and it is better than any default android gallery and it's really handy to back up your photos. The problem is that it is extremely hard to organise your photos. For example there is no way to delete a photo from the cloud without deleting it from your phone as well. WE NEED THIS FUNCTION GOOGLE! If this feature was added this would easily be 5 stars.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Have been using this app for the past year or so. It's been great! can't say enough about it. Everything including updates that regularly improve the app itself, easy to use self syncing, automatically sorts the junk photos and suggests which ones to use. As a small business man who's work includes the taking of many photos from 3-5 different devices on a regular basis this app not only does it all but does it all for you. Thanks Google. top marks from this customer !üòâüëç"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The movie making feature is just terrible. There's annoying things like it automatically adding music and not showing the entire clips you imported, and now it just keeps crashing as I'm trying to simply put together four 15 second clips. It just generally does not work well and isn't user friendly, and it's been this way for ages! You'd think a company like Google should be able to figure these things out..."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"To be honest I only really use the app because it is there and already on the device, saving me the hassle of having to find a new one. The experience is somewhat frustrating, I have been trying to upload a handful of pictures to Google photos across 3 devices and it has not worked. One device said the pictures were backed up but they never showed on my account. It's so frustrating that one has to deal with so many issues just to upload photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love that it randomly creates panoramas, collages and color pops out of your photos, as well as little animations from your videos. The default image enhancements used to be pretty good, now I don't like them so much, but that's just me. I used to have some issues with archiving photos before, but not anymore. I love being able to backup photos automatically. Also love that you can order a physical album from your photos in the app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,2021 update: still a terrible app. Jist wish there was a good competitor and I would drop Google in a heartbeat. Original review: Bad experience. They're always changing where the menu options are with each update . Guess what that is not necessary. Most annoying thing: when u try to add a description tova photo the keyboard covers the text area where you are writing so you cannot see if you made any mistakes. This had been a problem for a while.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"As I understand this, if a photo is here it was put here as a back up. Further, after I did the initial backup of all my photos to date, any other photos I take after that are automatically backed up here (if you are connected). I already saw evidence that it does happen. That is a very cool feature. All I need to do is periodically move them to my own permanent hard drive. Currently, this is the ONLY means for me to eventually get my photos from my phone to my PC where I can put them on a permanent backup hard drive. For some unknown reason neither bluetooth nor a USB cable transfer from my phone will work for that purpose. Almost fool proof. . . ."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It took me a while to realize that Google photos has their own cloud, I thought whenever I would back up and store, meant that my photos were being saved in my Google one account, which actually makes saving photo much more simplified, and if you decide to delete older photos and store them in trash, it gives you 30 days to change your mind to decide that you want to keep them, just pull up the photos in your trash and they are in your app again. Very simple and easy to use."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"For starters, I absolutely love Google Photos. It has become my one-stop solution for managing all of my photos that I own. I am a long-time user of the service now. However, with one of the latest updates (using on Pixel 3, Android 9), the Assistant now shows 'Order Prints' as a primary function, instead of 'Save'. This is an extremely tacky update that undermines the trust that I have in the service. Now every time I use the Assistant tab, I feel like I'm being up-sold to pay for their print services. I see this as a big step back for the app and will definitely reduce my use of the Assistant features."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love this app! My photos are always saved, I can have photos from multiple devices all stored in one safe location. The movie feature is amazing. I was able to create a video from all the stored photos over the years for my fathers funeral, which was super helpful during such drastic times. The animation and simple suggestions help me a great deal. Most importantly it allows me to free up space from my phone and store photos here."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"4.5 stars if I could. Great app, just.. Needs better sorting tools. Particularly when it comes to facial recognition, it would be handy to have a 'merge' option. Quick access to tagging/labels of selected photos would be a big help. Just.. Things like that. It currently takes at least an hour to find anything when I'm looking for a specific photo, but every update seems to make it a little easier and the sharing capabilities are first class."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have trusted Google Photos with my most precious memories since 2012. I have always been a fan of knowing every picture/video is safe and conveniently in one place. I absolutely love the features and options you have to do what you like with them, from simple collages or making a photo book to share with loved ones or (my favorite) make a heart warming slideshow to always take you back to a part of your life that you once enjoyed. Always looking forward to the new updates and features! ‚ô°"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Google photos puts together photo books, collages, improved photos, saves memories and makes sharing photos and photo albums easy. It could use IMPROVEMENT in the area of editing photos, especially in regard to simple tools such as cropping a photo, and intermediate but simple ones including blur. Having more advanced features such as object deletion would be a real help. Also skew, manually adjust corners, manual free crop & image text. (Google Lens) when working with and saving documents."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The Photos application is great. It is very convenient that all my photos get automatically backed up and soon appear on the web in Google Photos. I've allowed the app to remove the photos stored locally on my phone but there is practically no difference in accessing them. This freed up lots of memory. The automatic backup of photos is just one feature of many I really like.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,DO NOT use the Move to Folder feature!!!! I moved a few photos to a new folder to make it easier to organize them. The photos changed to all blanks and the date of capture changed to the time of move! How does that happen! I've also noticed that sometimes moving the photos to Google Drive also overrides the date of capture. So you lose the timeline and also the images are out of order and can't be arranged chronologically.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is complete nightmar! The file structure and function of is horrible to say the least. Here's an example: I just created a folder (and a matching album). I go to IG, click to add multiple photos, click on ""Gallery"" drop down and the folder is not there. Other folders show. Not the new one. Restated phone. Same thing. Also, why can't we create a folder when in an album view? This isn't even all the issues. It's just extremely frustrating and not able to be used efficiently. Plz fix"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I love that when you move images between folders, they just duplicate or never move at all, and if you delete the old original or also deletes the copy. There's no user friendly organization. I love that you took away folder view from the home screen of the app so you have to dig for what you want. Saving pictures creates a new folder for every image type. I wish I could install a replacement for this piece of work, and get rid of your app entirely. It's a nightmare for someone with OCD."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Super intuitive, and easy to use. My only complaint is that there are options in the Assistant mode that I can't figure out how to create myself-- color pop, for example. every so often Assistant will create a ""color pop"" photo (everything is black & white except for one item/area), but I don't think the option is available in the Google photos Edit mode."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Very useful to archive photos but I wish there was a way to prevent INSTANT sync of camera folder. Every bad pic I take of the same scene is uploaded! The instant a folder gets populated it's synced. More control needed. Still don't quite get the relationship between Google Drive and Photos. But that's my problem. Overall it's a great app with kind of a steep learning curve for organizing and private viewing.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to be great, but suddenly stopped working yesterday & no amount of restarting my phone or updating the app has helped. I'm assuming it's due to a recent update, but either way, whenever I open the app, it closes again seconds later. Can't do ANYTHING with it anymore. It's completely useless. Hope they fix this real soon. I can't see my photos. ü§¨"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Google's products are mostly great. But they do have imperfections...the editing tools Google offers incl. in this application are very half-assed: they seem to be there just so they have something for you to play with, bc the adjustments they enable are bunk. Theyre too raw & need to be refined or somehow altered so users can actually DO something with them that'd IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF A USER'S IMAGES. This apps fine tuning/adjustments SUCK."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It refuses to sync the photos captured on my tablet suddenly, but will do it for the phone. Eats too much battery. Glitch at times.The share function is slow. Should allow the option to delete all the Videos to save space on device, not the Photos. Why does the app take so much Internal Storage ""data"" space, when it's supposed to be a cloud based app? More photo filters and a better compilation video system would make it better."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, it is the best app for images, and it does really good at backing up your photos. Enough positives. Why is it that everytime I download a photo from the computer it says ""It can't download, device storage is full"" It's not full obvi! And I try to share it, it says ""We could not process your video/photo"" Like, what?! So then I uninstall it, reinstall it, still isn't processed, click the edit button, still says it's full, do the same again, and it gets so annoying! Like, why?!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good but needs some improvement. You need a ""jump to date"" option. I have a lot of photos and when I try to view a certain date with the slide bar on my phone it always shows days before or after. Hard to control the slide bar. Would be nice if you could double click the slider bar and be prompted to enter a date for a quick jump to. Also, why can't I update locations on the phone app. This would be a good option."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I hate this app and I hate that I use it. I don't want to entrust my images to a third party, but it would be easier than using this. App will let you create albums but they're completely arbitrary, and it's impossible to organize and file things to your own liking. Instead google will sort it for you! But only arbitrarily. Boy I sure hope you weren't thinking that you could save all your photos of one subject in a folder so you could easily find and send said photos to someone, that's too easy"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'd love to give this app 5 stars but I am sick of the never-ending ""backing up"" message for videos and the inability to actually see which videos have failed to back up. Google are well aware of this problem and, apparently, have developed some sort of new gallery feature to identify which videos have failed to back up. However, they have thus far failed to release this version in the U.S.!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Annoyed that the app continues to add device folders which I have not created. I've found possible fixes online because I'm apparently not the only one experiencing this problem. None of those things worked. The app continues to add folders containing, for example, profile pictures of all my Facebook friends and still shots and videos from unity ads and graphic assets. I deleted hundreds of folders and today found more. Another issue I have with this app is that I had to delete each folder individually. No way to select and delete multiple folders. I so wish I could remove this app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It really is the best out there. I've tried other photo/gallery apps and they just don't compare. The ease and the flexibility of capturing, backing up, modifying and reaccessing just can't be beat. My only glitch is I'm not a fan of having things out in some 'cloud.' When I find something that can outperform Google photos and regain my full privacy I'm gone."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I have been having issues with the editing features. It practically goes blank whenever i want to edit my photos. I initially thought it was a network interference but over time it hasn't changed. I feel dissatisfied with this app. Also the use of data to view all my photos is totally unacceptable to me! Do something fast about it please
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I find this feature awesome and also creepy. The fact that all my photos are being scanned through to create these videos, stylized photos, collages, etc.. makes me a bit uneasy if I'm being honest. However, I don't always want to take the time to make these things for Holidays, or Birthdays, and such so they are often appreciated. One more note, I have some ""personal"" photos that occasionally get mixed in with pictures of my kids, and therefore some videos come with a little...surprise!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Google photos is far too messy. The most important aspects of photo and video galleries are the setup and organization. The movies, downloads, videos, etc. show up in countless folders but are difficult to find sometimes. Making a movie with Google photos is useless. In no way could I share the video outside of it's album and watching only works in editing mode. Google photos is not all that bad in some areas, but their app should better demonstrate the abilities they have at their disposal."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The best app for photos. It is not only good for keeping your photos in one place, but u can share a large amount of images very quickly. The album feature helps me to be perfectly organised. And best part, u can open it in any device any time u want! How cool is that. Now there r a lot more features but I just can't keep on writing. Highly recommended üëç"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I like this app for the editing and storing of course but be careful when syncing it to your computer. I synced it to my pc and then transferred the photos to my pc as a backup and then deleted the photos from Google Photos thinking they were backed up. They didn't fully transfer over to my pc and you can't recover your deleted pictures if you empty the trash. So now i've lost a years worth of photos and memories. A long as you don't make my mistake it's a good app.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This is an incredible service for managing and sharing photos. My only issue is that the core task I'd want to do from phone, create albums for easy reference and sharing, does not work reliably. I never had any issues on iOS but it never works as expected on Android. I create an album and add photos and it appears all is well...and then the album disappears. Or I create a link to share and that's when the album disappears. Hence, a two star rating for the app even though I love the service."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It is absolutely stunning. Google photos is amazing. I don't need to stress looking for anyone's pictures because I can just type the person's name and picture appears. Also it makes amazing qualities which I don't have strength for. Lastly it stylish photos are fantastic it makes some of my pictures look brilliant. Google photos is in summary amazing.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app. Although with the Mate 20 Pro, it would say all items backed up which they are, but the ""Free Up Space"" option wouldn't be available due to ""backing up"" and then you would have to manually remove the items. Also is there any chance of an option to create folders in Google Photos. It would contribute to a more organized layout."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"App is great, the backup feature is even greater. The only suggestion I have is that can you add a scheduler for backup. I countries like India, we get data cap for each day. But we dont want all of it to be used up for backing up the photos and videos we took, but we won't want to waste it either, so by adding a scheduler, we can use all the remaining data by the end of the day. Do consider. Thanks alot for the app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It'd be nice if there's a feature to hide photos and have them accessible via a password or fingerprint. Also, I don't like that it sorts or groups the photos by date, I hope there's a feature to disable that. The albums look very stylish and simple though which I love but I opted out of it eventually because of customization issues which other photo galleries have ease of access."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Development is centered around creating silly features instead of fundamental functionality. For instance, uploading videos pretends to be fast, but a low resolution version is created first before you are able to access the high bitrate version (it's completely opaque when the full quality video will be available). AI search is great, but why does it take up to two minutes to save a video, and I can't browse in the meantime? Do it in the background. Album creation/sharing still buggy trash."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app, easy to use and I love the video stabilization feature! Just one suggestion: when I am prompted to archive items, and I click to ""review suggestions "", currently my only option is either to archive items or do nothing. Many times I would either like to delete or re-organize files (move to different folder, rename, etc) but I am unable to do so . Please add this function."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very, VERY useful. I've had google photos since around 2015 and I'm grateful for it, since it has kept all my pictures and videos saved for many years. It kind of sucks that it'll no longer be free come June, but there are no alternatives that have the features and simplicity that Google Photos has, so I'm honestly fine paying like $2 a month for 100GB of storage."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Tons of options! Lifesaver when it comes to backing up pictures from your gallery. If not for Google Photos I would have lost 1000 precious memories numerous times. Also love the map/timeline feature and having the option to view photos from where they were taken. It's like you get to experience and relive the memory all over again. Smooth interface and easy to navigate.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love the app, but the July 2020 update decreased my usability. Recent highlights and X years ago changed from a list to a slideshow. Swiping seems to change year, not to slide through the photos from that year. Makes it difficult to view old pictures and share them with friends, or just show something on my pH me to a friend. I did like the map search that shows hotspots. Other long term gripe is the inability to automatically find and remove duplicates, something that Picasa had."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Google photos is amazing. The app never crashes. Automatic upload of all my photos. Super cheap and well worth it to upgrade and add extra storage. The fact that it recognizes faces (I can save the names of everyone in my photos) and I can search for literally anything and it'll find it is hands down the most convenient and mind blowing aspect. I can type in chicken and it finds all my chicken photos!!
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google photos has been very helpful in organizing all of my photos. Albums are easy to get to, and even set up for automatically sorting photos based on who's in them. My one gripe is that you can't upload multiple photos from google photos to instagram or Facebook. One photo will allow you to upload to your feed, but as soon as you select multiple, it doesn't give you that option. Please fix! It makes it difficult to upload photos that were taken more than a couple weeks ago!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I've been using this app for photo management for a very long time now. I especially love(d) the photo editor. Recently they updated it and entirely changed the interface. I believe this is to make the features of the editor more independent so people that may not have been aware of their existence are able to have a basic understanding of how they work. Unfortunately this also had drastically slowed down their functionality as each needs to be swiped to now. I'm going to stop using it.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Happens over and over. I create a new album. It won't add all selected photos or videos. I can spend hours trying to ""fix"" it. I try to turn on link sharing. It won't. I'm now on vacation and have had these issues all week. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, tried internet through wifi and cell. At other times I also find empty files or missing albums on Google Drive or Google Photos. And I do pay extra every month for unlimited 2T storage and still have plenty free."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Pictures take forever to move to different folders and even longer to refresh. Some pictures I moved are still in the folder but when I click on them it says it doesn't exist. No matter what I've updated it too it has this problem. I don't like that is shows the shared albums really big (I only have 2) then the rest of my folders are small and I have to scroll across and click see more to get to them. Samsung photos is faster and easier to use but I don't have a Samsung phone anymore.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Your image search is the most inaccurate thing I've ever used.. I'm searching for pictures of my Camera and it's apparently showing me every picture that was taken with a camera (you don't say üôÑ). I searched for 'black bird' and the results were ridiculous. Your auto collage function almost always cuts out the important part of the images I'm trying to include. Also please add support for .Rw2 raw file format of Panasonic.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Poor. The Album function displays photos in random sequence, not in the order I choose, and removes photos from the album when I try to rearrange them. I've reported this issue to Google repeatedly, to no avail. Another issue: there used to be a way to starred photos as ""Favorites"" but that feature appears to be gone and all the photos I had starred as ""Favorites"" are no longer so. There are other issues but these two are the most serious ones for me Seeking alternatives to this product."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"With the latest update the app keeps crashing as soon as I open it. The same happens from the camera app, when I want to browse the photos I just took. That's a horrible user experience for a camera app if someone relies on it as the main camera to take photos during vacation, like me at this point. I can't share photos with anyone. I'm not sure when/if I'll be able to retrieve them. This seriously undermines my trust in the app. Please fix it urgently."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been creating an album a day for 3 years and sharing them with family. Up until recently it worked beautifully. Lately it's been pissing me off!!! I create a folder and it ejects random pictures and videos without notice for no reason!!! No matter how many times I try to put them back in, they just keep removing the same ones! Something needs to figure out this bug and fix it fast!!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love how Google Photos organizes photos not only by date, but by face (recognition), and how it offers logical suggestions that I usually accept. For instance, I receive suggestions for photos that I might want to rotate or archive. The editing features are straightforward which makes them easy to use. Overall, it helps me to easily organize and search for photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Google photos has been my primary photo editing tool for several years and I've been quite happy with the simple and quick interface for touching up photos. With the latest update, it takes more steps to adjust brightness and color than the old interface, which makes the process frustrating when trying to get things just right. Additionally, the prompts to either save as or overwrite and the vibrate on touch are just annoying features that seem unnecessary. Please bring back the old interface"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall a very useful app to back up photos and videos from my Android devices to the Google servers, using the unlimited storage in high quality. The only thing I would say should be included is a percentage indicator on the progress bar for uploads or maybe a real-time upload speed indicator in Mbps or kbps. Its annoying seeing the bar stop or get stuck and then suddenly restart again, with no indication of why that's happened. So that part needs to be more user friendly I think."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like the photo storage, and the ability to share pictures with people. The editing features could be better. It would be nice if it had a paste function, so you could put a picture in with another picture. That would make it like a real photo editor. Also, the markup feature needs more colors! I edit pictures all the time on my computer, and I can think of many other features that Google photos is lacking."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app to save your photos just in case decided that your phone should no longer work, get broken, or lost. I've used it many times to restore my photos and all my albums back onto my phone. Just set it to automatically back your photos and or videos up and you'll always be covered. Life is sketchy so always do what you can to Insure things go your way!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is a complete piece of garbage. Way too complicated, too many different types of uploads (archives, photobooks, etc.), and continuously lags out. I constantly have to force stop the app and even sometimes restart my phone to continue organizing my photos. I literally can't even move photos to appropriate folders because i constantly get the ""trouble moving 1 item"". Infuriating! I found that using the default Download app on my phone is far simpler and easier to use for organizing my photos. It also has no errors."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I used an ""economically priced"" phone for a while. The memory was poor, and having the ability to upload to the cloud was very helpful. I now havev a Pixel phone, but still continue to use the app. I love the daily review of the previous days pictures, historical ""look back"" photos, and animation of images all compiled and produced by the Google Assistant in the app. I wish I could choose collage orientations or order of images, but all the rest is awesome!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The functionality of this app is better than most photo apps. However, managing photos would be easier if creating an album and putting pictures in to said album then took them out of your camera roll. I like the idea of an album being locked so the contents are secure, say, for example if a child was to play with your phone. Are these things possible to implement?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"it is not as flexible as my old iPhone. some photos and videos I have to save to clipboard and then can't find them. sometimes I want to post from my albums, but only the gallery is available. moving pictures or videos from albums is problematic. I have tried at least 6 times to download the update and it will not download. Just get the circling."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Overall it is a great app. Though, like other people, I have been experiencing problems. One, even though all my photos are backed up and synced, it doesn't show some of my important photos and videos. Next, my photos and videos are scattered, and not in order of how it was in order. I have a couple of other bugs, where it kicks me from the app, just shows a white screen, etc. I still like this app, though it can be better."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"really bad move to remove the auto sync with drive. That's exactly what made photos really special, everything in one place without any problem, like everything in your google account. So what now, we need to make the sync, so we can use any cloud space we want (the cheaper or the easier one.. ...or maybe both!) good look with this move! But, honestly, I think this will move more people away from google drive than ever!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Its cool, but is google really struggling so much for money that they can't allow us to back up pics and vidoes for free? I'm going to have to start using a couple external hard drives cause I'm not paying for it anymore....especially when they keep finding ways to charge more. Also, months ago, when I first started having to pay, I had a lot of storage and then randomly, in a very short period of time without adding much of anything it said I was completely out and had to pay."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Phenomenal little thing that probably does more than it should and a lot of it is superfluous. But Google is smart enough to know to make of it a non-problem because it doesn't actually have any impact on the user. Example: the Assistant-driven features. Stylized photos add a nice touch but I have never used it because all I will at most do to a picture is Enhance and then share/forget. The cool thing is that all these creations live in the Cloud, not taking up my own storage so ""why not?"""
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I much prefer the original design over this new UI. It used to be very simple to switch between photos and albums, but now it is all redesigned to the library tab. I am all for security and bug fixes, though I would have given 5 stars if I could opt out of a UI redesign. IMO, such jarring changes detract from the usability experience customers have become accustomed to over the last few years. Good idea fairies should stay silent and leave well enough alone if the customers are already happy."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a great app. I love almost everything there except the fact that I can't make a movie and share the file independently. Each time I make one, I have to share the link for my friends to see what I have done, which is kind of annoying. The second thing is ""Pictures Collage"", I can't chose more than 4 pictures, not even the position of the pictures. Everything is done automatically and no changes thereafter. So, 4 stars. üòå"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Very confusing. Very difficult to locate photos as it creates it's own folders. It should replicate the folders as they are on the phone with the same name. Very difficult and user unfriendly app. Cannot download photos on the laptop. They are as good as lost. Very irritating. Don't even kow how to stop the photos from getting backed up without losing the ones that already have been.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really like this app. It used to not be very useful to me when it wouldn't allow you to do basic edits like cropping, but now it does! It keeps all of my photos in one place, even from past devices through my Google account. It also had a page that suggests automatic stylized edits for some photos (you dont have to use them though). All around it's a solid app!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible app. There is no mass camera roll, instead the default storage of photos is by date, which just looks and feels more unorganized. Counterintuitive I know, but it's true. Photos taken in airplane mode just default to a random date, meaning you can't find them very easily when you want to see them, and obviously they aren't in the correct chronology of when you took them. Automatically creates random photo folders without adding those photos to your camera roll. 1 star do not recommend."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"After spending hours of organizing photos on my phone, I turned to google photos to organize my backup photos in the same way using albums. While you can add albums to google photos, the photos in the albums show up in photos tab as well all organized by the date the photo was taken, which makes it difficult to determine what photos are already in albums. Ideally under the photo tab I would like to see all the albums I have and then the photos that have yet to be added into an album. I ended up backing all my photos on a hard drive and deleting all my photos from the app, it just seems too overwhelming to organize photos on my phone as well as the app. I did appreciate that the app did not let you delete photos from your SD card without permission, however I did notice on the site if you deleted a photo that was on the SD card, it continues to show up on the app, but not the website which creates a disconnect from the app and site, creating an even more overwhelming experience when trying to organize photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The Google Photos app works nice and smoothly, offers good local photo browsing, viewing and editing capabilities but what sets it apart is the backup and sync to the online storage. I'm missing an option in the editor to save a copy with an option to resize. And what's really disappointing is that casting photos to a 4K TV uses mediocre image quality."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Be warned, it is referred to as backup and sync but it is actually mirroring/linking! What I mean is it isn't creating a copy of your files where you can delete photos from the backup and keep the original on your phone, if you delete photos from Google photos it deletes it from the device too. And you cannot turn that off. Even if you turn backups off. That might not be a big deal to most people but it is to me, Amazon photos works more as you would expect and it's my choice"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have a LOT of photos on my phone. This app is helpful for accessing them but it is so, so frustrating that there is no option to access the individual folders (albums) on my phone, but must go through them chronologically. This is not so bad if you know the date a particular photo was taken. Although this is a pain in the neck, it is doable. However, for photos that have been altered multiple times, it's near impossible. Please fix it so that albums on phones can be accessed!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"There are several quirks that make the app not as easy or useful since the current updates. But...my main complaint is that it now severely limits the view you can choose to use as a wallpaper. I've always been able to freely choose the perimeters when using a personal photo as a wallpaper, but no longer have that option. It only gives you a small portion to choose from, rather than the entire picture. I've changed settings, tried the obvious pinch/zoom, but to no avail. Hate it!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Can't seem to update the app. Other apps I have all update but not this one. Somehow it decided to purge the bulk of my downloads folder. I don't have any apps that are set to clear it out automatically. Suddenly images and video clips had no thumbnail then they were all lost. I also do not want it auto generating compositions nor trying to link to a print shop. I also want to be able to access my synced files from my google drive. They don't show up there. Where do they get saved? Why app only?
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It doesn't let you edit collages at all. If you want to have the pictures swap places or if something got cropped out, too bad, you can't fix it. Also, you can't choose how your albums are organized, they will always be organized by most recent. So if the last thing you took a picture of or saved was something you don't want anyone to accidently see, too bad, it's going to be at the top of your list of albums."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Not happy at all about discontinuing unlimited storage. I may have to find an alternative. Also, being able to change the orientation of all photos at once instead of sporadically when Google photos notices it works be great. I like that I can label and create folders, find pics by faces, month, year, event, and location. Creating a link to share many videos and photos and awesome and fast. I like the memories, and collages and videos it creates too."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Stupid stupid photo app. I hate this thing. There's no way to organize your photos and God forbid you take a portrait photo! It will store every. single. photo. in a separate folder. So when you try to post a picture you have to literally scroll for minutes at a time trying to find the photo because it's not stored in your normal ""Camera"" folder. And there's no way to transfer it to the ""Camera"" folder. It will take me upwards of 30 freakin minutes to post pics on IG because of the set up."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm not one to hate app updates. I work in IT and I'm all for improvements, and usually love learning new UIs if it means a better experience. The changes Google photos has been making over the past year and a half are the opposite of user friendly. Making simple things difficult to do, forcing unwanted things upon you, and most importantly, removing options for how YOU want to manage your photos, only how they want you to. I'd sooner recommend the default file browser app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing storage app. Great way to keep photography memories save. If i may suggest something. It Would be nice if the app automatically picks up when a gif,image,video or photo ect has already previously been backed up and pops up a notification stating something already exist. But not by the name or number of that specific photo ect but by the image itself. E.G Like my profile photo. It has ready been backed up before and also removed from my phone. But when i save it back to my device coz i would like to use it again. Then When its time to do another back up it must notify me that the exact same photo already exists. Otherwise we all end up having doubles,tripples and sometimes even more than 5 of the same image backed up which is kind of a waste of space. Thanks #GooglePhotos. I love your great app. Keep it up"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There are several things that should be easy to do that are either hard or impossible. After so many years in existence, I expect a better product. Examples: 1) if there is a small photo, in slideshow mode what is the point of showing it as small? At least give the user the option of resizing the photo, 2) there should be the option to control the speed of a slideshow - e.g., what if there is text that takes time to read?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is the most incomplete service ever. 1. Once you you backup your photos to google photos, you can't delete them anymore keeping them on device. That is if you delete them, they will be deleted from your device also. who designed it? 2. you can't select all with one tap. 3. you can't save to device multiple items at a time. 4. a lot of items from different folders synced in camera folder. what is that? 5. camera folder is automatically backed up. why? I'm feeling trapped"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Don't delete images from people's phones woth just a single, short warning. Please, think again about this particular design. A delete button would indicate that something is deleted from the photos app, not from both the app as well as the user's phone. Otherwise great service, and it's a really great accomplishment to save so many images and videos of people who could lose them by phone loss, phone damage or otherwise."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really do love this app and the security of knowing my photos are backed up and accessible from everywhere. Although it frequently gets it wrong or makes weird things, the auto suggested collages, animations, videos, etc are frequently fun. I do wish that the collage maker allowed for a little bit more control (photo cropping, placement, order, etc) like the old Picassa app used to have. And it is still very cumbersome to correct misidentified faces. But aside from that, it's a great app!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Excellent app, until last update. The automatic creations are too hard to get to now. I keep getting notifications for the ones it is creating, but it won't take me to where they're at, it takes me to a highlight reel with no navigation features, other than to sit through the whole thing and hope I can save it the next time around. Its awful, please separate creations again. The whole new layout makes it less functional overall, but it broke that feature."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Upon using the app with chromecast, it's all good until the screen is on and the app is running. Once the screen turns off or if I have to get to another app simultaneously with my photos content playing on TV, THERE'S NO AUDIO!!! Only when i go back to the app, there's sound. Else it's only a mute video to play. Please fix this very irritating bug."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Any time I try to load a video, the app will buffer or freeze for the video with no way to fix consistently. This is common with screen recordings, but can happen with most videos. Photos will mix up the dates that photos and videos are downloaded, and say they've been taken at impossible times. There is no way to search for media unless the app itself has decided what's in the photo (which is wrong on many occasions.) There are other issues that I can't fit in here, but need to be fixed."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google Photos has been my go-to for everything we document in our lives. The program is very intuitive. It will convert your best memories into albums, animations, videos and more. The technology will even archive old photos or screenshots, with your permission of course! Program works with most third party websites to upload and order prints as well. Cant say enough!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is very useful, as it not only stores your photos (as you would expect) but it also allows you to categorise for certain things (eg. ducks) and to filter for certain places (eg. taken in Dublin). It also prompts you if you have photos that are taking up space that aren't very good, e.g. blurry photos, or screenshots of videogames. Also, there are of course no ads or in-app purchases. However, there is one problem with the UI, in that it shows photos at different sizes on the screen."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I agree that there are issues as described by the 3 reviews I just read. I don't like how the app reorganizes my photos and makes it difficult for my use as I prefer to keep them in chronological order. While I appreciate the artistic groupi ng the app does and the reminders...this day a year ago...I wish it didnt sort things and save them in an order other than as the pictures were taken. Just a personal preference...if this is something I can reset in settings, please advise. Thank you! Peace"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app excels at being great at the simple things. I really like that it's not in your face about all the features it offers, it just works which is something that I can appreciate. It seems as if the developers know exactly how photos should be organized. I also really like that the AI edits some of the pictures I take doing things to the original image I would never have thought to do. Also being a pixel owner just optimizes the experience of the wonderful camera. 10/10 would recommend to a friend üëåüèΩ"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pretty good, comprehensive and useful features for dealing with your photos. One such example is the search feature which can yield sometimes scarily accurate results! However the selection features on the app are pretty lacking, for example there is no select all features, and there is no direct way to replicate device folders as online albums. Those features would go a long way in improving the app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I was trying to make a birthday video (also called movies in the app) for a friend with a few pictures and short videos and after editing and selecting the background music i wasn't able to save it and send it to my friend. It appears in the movies section but if i want to share it I'm not able to. It creates a sharing link through drive but its not playable. It's not playing neither in the app...
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's ok, but I would expect more from Google. It is not helpful at curating photos and removing duplicates. Especially if you feed in photographs from WhatsApp and other apps, you can quickly end up with lots of duplicates, as well as near-duplicates at different resolutions. I think Google could easily use AI to resolve this, but chooses not to because they prefer to charge people money for storage space."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Downloaded 107k pics and videos from iCloud. Uploaded them from desktop to photos app (so don't have to do it over WiFi) in original quality. App won't recognise it's already sync'd and redownloads them. What's even worse is it gets stuck 'preparing to back up' or 'backing up' but nothing happens. Trawled forums for 3 weeks trying to get it to work and wasted countless hours trying to fix it. What's even worse no matter the permission I give it the app needs to be open to sync. S20+.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Easy way to archive photos, edit, crop, etc., and even experiment with colorization, and if you make a mistake, you simply revert back to the original photo. Fascinating! I just wish all of the features available through membership were available to everyone. One last thing: Who was the ""genius"" that thought it was a good idea to rate everything, no matter how innocuous, AND, as if that's insufficient fodder, have to tell you how we feel about it? Mind-boggling, and a HUGE waste of time!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very good for managing photos. Unlimited storage for Pixel devices is really awesome. Miss the photos assistant notifying me that it has created optimized, animated, or video like things. I thought that feature was really cool and hope for more of that in the future. Would like to be able to mark folders as ""private"". Not everyone needs to see everything, especially shoulder-surfers."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This is a great app to keep a backup of your pictures. What I don't like this when it backs it up from my phone it takes the picture from my phone and puts it in the general repository on the Google Cloud, not maintaining the folder from which is was backed up on my phone. In addition to that, I can't file photos into folders within Google photos, but there is no way to see what is still left in the repository that hasn't been filed as a repository just exists as a whole."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Google, why!? You had a perfectly good, app.. functional and easy to use. And now you've changed everything.. it's not easier, you haven't added functionality or features (that I can tell/use on a daily basis). Make the mistake of clicking on the auto editing suggestions, you can't undo them without cancelling and starting from scratch. Stop trying to reinvent the wheel! There is nothing innovative about the changes you've made to the layout and usability, just annoying."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Love it but there are things I don't quite understand. Albums: there's has to be sorting options. You can only see the photos chronologically. I have shared albums with my family. We upload there photos we really like and it's getting crowded. I get a notification when someone upload a new photo to one of those albums and I have to scroll manually to the bottom. And that's the other thing about albums. There's no scroll bar within albums. Everything else in the app has scroll bar and I'm waiting to see it implemented as well on albums. I've already asked it months ago in a feedback. The other thing, minor but useful too, is that i wish I could tag people in order to see them when I select their faces. There are some photos that it doesn't recognize their faces and sometimes I'd like to tag a person just because that's their back"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great, great, great application! I personally love the way you are able to get the application itself to create an amazing array of different kinds of animation's, movie's and collage's plus other kinds of impressive photography trick's to make your photos look like you are a great professional photographer for time magazine's photo journalism section on taking, picking, tricking out, arranging, organization's, polishing and storing each and every one of those incredible photos we all have taken from time to time and didn't get a chance to do those things with them and then always what a great surprise to hear from google notification's that, ""your photos are ready now! Check them out?"" And of course, i basically just always say yes! It's really great to see what google photos was created and prepared and ready to go somewhere for myself and then now, I'd like to thank you for so many awesome creations google photos! Thanks so much I really appreciate it and I love you okay google photos! Have a great day! Eddie Kamenzind 2018, November something,. Thanks google photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google Photos is the best photo managing app out there. Photos are backed up instantly, you get unlimited cloud storage, and it has lots of great features. You can organize your photos into folders and you can crop and adjust them. Also, you can easily make videos, animations, and collages. Google automatically suggests edits to photos and suggests who to share them with. My favorite part is that it groups faces of people and pets into folders. I would highly recommend!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The collage options are fairly limited. Not like the digital photo book creation programs which offer stylish options for creating an album before having it printed into book form. Also, I truly hate the lack of organising the photos like you can do in the computer, in the form of folders. It should be easy for Google to scan all the folders, and still offer all the options it has now to offer for bulk overview, and auto organising, recognition of faces and items, auto collage and auto animation etc. But at least, we should be able to organise our photos in folders and not only in the form of albums. For this reason, it will never become my favourite. Countless people complain about this missing option to organise, but still, the developers seem to refuse to include this simple option. Why? Why they want to force everybody to like their idea? People who don't like to organise, will never use folders and simply upload everything in a bulk folder. But those that make countless photos or use photos in a professional manner, like to organise them. Look more at Adobe Lightroom for editing, tagging and countless ways of organising them, or making collections and collages. Don't try to reinvent the wheel in a market or business, which you have no professional clue about. You had a product that was much better. Picasa was an obvious clone / copy of Lightroom, but for some strange reason have you discontinued it. Also, I think you should offer way more digital editing options. If there can be online Photoshop and Lightroom, or variants than resemble them very closely, then you can do much better in what you offer now. Google Photos is nice, but it can be MUCH MUCH better than it is now. It still has a long way to go before it is really the perfect online backup and editing tool and will become everyone's preferred choice. Who knows they are listening and reading the comments and will try to become exactly that."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Super useful, theres a lot of cool features and you never have to worry about losing your photos. The face ID is not great and you can't manually add a face. Other than that fun an useful and you can make albums and order photo books and all that jazz so im a fan. Edit: you can finally manually add a face to a category, it's buggy but it's alright"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Has great features (like face detection, sync, sharing, among others) but I think it could be better. The way it shows the folders isn't that easy to navigate and as it opens, the main tab ""photos"" only shows the camera's photo when in fact I'd really like to go directly to the folders, eg: downloads, WhatsApp photos, videos, VSCO, whatever."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Its great not having to worry about my phone running out of space any more. All my photos are stored worry free without any effort. Also, the search functions are very helpful. It makes it easy to find a photo from 4 years ago that randomly came up in conversation in less than 30 seconds usually. No endless scrolling trying to find stuff. The only thing is I wish I could post directly to Instagram from photos. Its annoying having to download the photo and then post it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Add the option to rename the photos/videos (which are no longer in our devices) added to albums, please! And the option to add tags to the photos/videos, so that way we could easily find them, because a lot of times certain words doesn't give any result or we want to find photos of a particular person, please. This app could be amazing but it needs a lot of fixing!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I loved this App until the update last night. Now my battery drains extremely quick and it takes forever to charge. Suddenly after the update last night my battery drained and after 1 hour it only had 1%. I left it charging overnight and after 7 hours it was at 93%. I haven't used it in over 2 hours and it's drained 16% with no use. There were two apps that were updated at the same time which were both Google. One was Google Docs the other was this one Google photos. It would be great if you had a rollback option rather than waiting for a fix bug update. Thanks! BTW I tried 3 different adaptors and power outlets.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I still love this app, that's why I rated it 5 stars! However, I didn't like the little changes it had after an update! Those ""favorites, utilities, archive, and trash"" shouldn't be displayed in the upper corner of the library!‚Äîespecially the trash! I used to store them some private photos that I don't wanna get exposed, but also I wanted to stay for a while if I ever change my mind! If they are visible that way, people may check what's in there because they look enticing!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"EDIT: to my absolute bewilderment, the great feature described below has now, for some bizarre reason, been removed from the latest version...... their answer below is simply idiotic ‚Äì you want a better rating, bring that damn feature back. OLD REVIEW: The new feature whereby pictures across all albums are plotted on a map, with a heat/color map indexing how many pictures there are - this is a great feature, and deserves a five-star rating alone!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"For what it's worth, what makes this app different from.othwr apps is the Google Assistant and Google's machine learning algorithms running in the backend for you. I no longer have to sort or categorise photos, keyword searches are more than capable. The timeline based navigation is also another feature. Really love the way we can zoom in and out of a photo collection."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,One reviewer complained about not being able to make folders and I don't get what they're talking about because I made folders (they're just called albums!). I was backing up to a hard drive & wanted to see what pictures I had so I made of bunch of folders for different things. The one thing I did wish they made easier was transferring from my computer to the hard drive because there were more steps then when I transferred from Dropbox. Other than that I'm happy with this app and that my pictures automatically update to it
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,U guys are trying to steer my actions with this app and it's awful. You keep trying to get me to buy prints which I never will. The app decides which photos are my favorites and they are wrong and they categorize my pictures in a manner I don't like. then you make it difficult to do simple things which I can't even find sometimes on several menus on there. I'm trying to delete pictures from my phone. Multiple pictures at once and permanently delete them. I can't find that option.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The photos are all over the place with the old gallery they were great I could find my photos instantly. I absolutely abhor Google photos. There's nothing with the three lines where you can go to with options to do things with your photos. It is so complicated. It's always the way you get programmers to keep their jobs by constantly correcting things that don't need to be corrected. I hate this app hate it.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Meh. I thought these guys were smart. You can't lock the app or mark certain albums private. You can't store photos separately from your phone and the back-up cloud. Backed-up photos must exist on your phone and on the Google photo desktop app. There is no way to ""gallery"" photos that you want to save but not be on your phone. One must download photos to another location. This is Google, their tools should be able to do more. Overall, a huge disappoint."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"All in all not a bad app BUT, and there's always a but 1. When I make a collage I'd like to pick from a few different templates to show off these photos. It's all the same even with different photos. I want to choose where to put them and how big each photo can/should be. After all they're my memories. 2. When I try to write on the pics in the editor part, you can't see the writing. What's the sense of having that option if it's absolutely useless. Once these are fixed I'll change my rating."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So frustrating as there are too many folders, I don't want folders! I just want to see my photos, I don't want to spend ages searching through different folders before eventually giving up!!! The only thing I miss about an iPhone is the photo app, Google needs to go back to the drawing board on this one as it doesn't even compare. And the fact that I'm constantly prompted to upgrade to Google One is super annoying. The only saving grace is the fact that I can use Google Lens from a photo."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"When I save screen shots, instead of saving to the area they are supposed to go, they go to some different section, and this I can't save them to the photo album s I want to save them too. Also,I keep my photos backed up daily. I've had times where I have needed to switch to a new phone. I'd re-backup to a new phone, then returned my old cell phone to the manufacturer! Then I discover that only abt half of my photos were transfered!!! And I'm now missing photos that I can never replace!!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I loved the Google photos app before when it surprised us with auto created animations, collages, and the movies (especially the ""they grow so fast"" movies with the music). Now it's so much harder to find the different albums, really unclear where to make your own projects. I find this version not as user friendly or intuitive as previous versions. I really want the old version back. It made sense. Just keep updating that version!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Working horribly now... App crashing a lot working with new album I created. It has many photos, but still very much below limit of 2000. Many times to remove a photo from the album have to do it twice. Selecting some photos from the album goes to the wrong ones. Photos that were previously deleted appear again when scrolling the album. When it works it is not bad!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The movies that Google creates are often a sweet little surprise. My favorites are the ""they grow up so fast"" ones that it automatically creates. It's also impressive because it's been so accurate even though my photos aren't named and my boys look very similar as babies. Google also makes it easy to transfer everything. This app will continue to be my primary app for photo storage!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's very convenient, and the photo ID and search is pretty impressive. However, I desperately want to label my photos (both in groups and individually), a feature that was supported by Picasa. The only way to label your photos currently, is to sort them into albums. This produces a glut of albums. It would help if you could sort albums into folders, but you can't. Finally, I don't like how hard it is to edit a photo and find it again, since the edit is saved in a different location."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Up until recently, Photos has been my go-to backup app for all my photos and videos. But just recently I changed my phone, and this app is having major issues. 1) It's double-backing up photos that are already backed up in my Photos cloud, 2) it's been stuck in ""getting ready to backup"" for 2 days now, and 3) it's not backing up all of my photos! I've done all the ""solutions"" posted in the forums, to no avail! Please fix this problem ASAP. Thanks."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used to like it but with all the recent updates, it's quite annoying. This folder keeps popping up and random pictures are automatically placed there. If I move pictures from my download to another folder, it doesn't recognize what date the pic was taken so shows up out of order. I can no longer create new folders on my external drive to save cloud/phone space. That used to be super easy and now doesn't work at all. Just overall, it's very frustrating to maneuver now."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I pay yearly for storage and I have uninstalled and reinstalled this app a few times to try to get it to backup my stuff. If it does actually backup, then I also cannot play backed up videos from the Google photos app. It says ""cannot play right now"". I mean WOW! This is so inconvenient when I'm trying to show work to potential clients. It used to work great and now it doesn't. I hope this gets fixed. If not I will be switching to Apple because it's affecting my work negatively. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have loved this app, having used it for about 7 years now. I have saved literally thousands of photos, and organized them into albums. I also like being able to edit (to some degree) within this app, without having to do it with a separate program. The only negative about it is that when I changed my email address, thousands of photos and all of my albums disappeared. I later found them, after finding how to go into the app under my old email address. Would be great if you could merge the two"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have been using this app to back up my media for years. I've been on the 200 GB plan for $2.99 since 2013. It's taken me almost 9 years to use 200 GB, and when I thought I could upgrade the storage to the next level, Google is only giving the option of 2TB for $9.99. Firstly, I don't need 2TB, and I don't want to jump from paying $2.99/month to $9.99/month! What makes matters worse, is that google is offering 500 GB for $5/month exclusively for T-Mobile customers! THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love that all my photos and videos are in one place, and especially love how it puts videos, pic collages, and pop up memories together for You! Only thing I wish was different is make it easier to put photo books, calendars, or just prints together from other suppliers other than Google. I hate that I have to download the photos I want before I can use them. Takes to much time and waste of computer space."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Fantastic. I'm particularly in love with the gallery layout and how they did it. Seeing every photo in its proper aspect ratio instead of being a thumbnail is amazing. My only issue is that Google Photos has these black bars that won't go away when viewing a photo. It's hard to ignore. It's mostly obvious when I put my device horizontally and tap, so none of the image settings are apparent."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Two major problems with this app: If I try to add descriptions/captions for my photos, the app constantly deletes or rearranges them so that whatever I wrote is all mixed up and assigned to the wrong photo. It's a nightmare. On top of that, it often refuses to let me add photos to my albums. To fix both of these problems, I have to use the desktop site instead. So annoying."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I do like the quick and easy editing of photos, HOWEVER, I absolutely despise the way it automatically sorts your photos & it makes it impossible to keep all of them in one place where everything's easy to find. I want to arrange them my own way, not divided up into dates and subjects and types and all that. I absolutely hate this feature!!!!! It makes it so hard to quickly find a photo when you know what you're looking for but have to go through folder after folder after folder just to find it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Phenomenal experience that the app offers. My friends envy the video and animation creativity that I do with the help of the app. I don't need much company as long as I am kept busy with my Google Photos. I enjoy mostly making video using my own photos. It is good for both indoor and outdoor adventure. The app is absolutely amazing and deserves a trophy. I wouldn't change it for any other. I would suggest the video sounds be compatible with the background of the phone or event. Keep that flag
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is not as user friendly as photo apps on other phones. Some photos seem to move folder, or I can't find them on other apps. The format also changes frequently, so when I've just got used to how it works I find everything is in a different place - or, more to the point, I can't find things! It also constantly suggests recolouring photos that are fine."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's tough to rate this App. On one hand it has limitations & is pretty ""bare bones"" as far as the platform & options go. On the other hand I can't think of any functionality issues & the App allows you to get Unlimited Photos/Video back-up (Cloud Storage) Free & w/out annoying ads. You really can't beat it. I have tried lots of the competitors similar Apps & this is definitely the best. (FTR I have no stake in Google, just a fan of this App)."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This application is fantastic to categories all your saved photos by specific individuals, places, pets, dates, events, etc so that it is easy to find them anytime you want. You can also create collages and video montages of different photos. I love the fact that it is always being improved with consideration of all the users feedback. The more you rate and provide feedback the better the application becomes."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I think the app is super GREAT. It provides the user with multiple selections. Such as: collages, animation photos, daily grouped photos, personalized photos and it provides you with photos you've taken a year prior! That isn't everything that this app does either! One feature I just ABSOLUTELY LOVE is that you can link it to your Google account so that you can back-up every single picture, screenshot, video's, and even Facebook photos. This makes it so that you can automatically clear up however much space those items were taking up on your internal storage. How awesome is that? I would definitely install this on my phone, if I didn't already have it!!!! Besides, if you don't enjoy using this app, then all you have to do uninstall it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Google photos, with the multiple folders for each app, the organization, the ease of making albums and the ability to go from looking at your images to making a book you can purchase with the photos printed in it. It's easy to navigate, I love the notifications and the smart ability to keep track of old images we don't often look at and may not want to keep."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app. 4 ‚≠ês. Only because It just takes way too long for the pictures to backup. If i have a 1000 pictures to backup that day, it's hours before it's done and I can remove the pictures from my device. All the other features and automatic formating is awesome. Been using the app for years now. Helped me save memories that otherwise would have been lost through the loss of various devices at one time or another."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is a really good app.. Has many filters and new features that can be used to make collages, animations, movies, etc. They even make automatic animations and collages, and you can choose to either save or delete them. One thing I don't like is even though the photos and videos are backed up the old videos only play on wifi. I hope Google Photos will help and change this. Other than that it's a great app. Highly recommended."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's fantastic to have the peace of mind knowing that any memories I capture are backed up as frequently as I access WiFi. Being able to access them anywhere and on almost any device is extremely useful as well. It is slightly disturbing how it analyses your photos, but as with all things Google the benefits generally outweigh the intrusion."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Gallery folders go missing, and I have to search for the images. The only options I'm given are to either create and place them in an album or Archive them. The problem with putting them in an album is that albums never show up whenever I want to send a photo from it. An example, I use Amino a lot where it shows the different gallery folders. Albums do not show up. The problem with archiving the images is once they're archived, they're stuck archived and can't be moved. Can't organize images."

I highly reccomend this app to everyone. üòäüëç"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"1. Bad December update - there used to be an option to take snapshots while taking a video, but it's gone now. There're no options or setting on the video screen now while the video is being recorded. 2. Why do I have to jump through a 1000 hoops to get a picture marked up? The editing options are laughable - the pen or marker size is fixed, which makes them useless on a phone screen. Each markup is saved as a separate copy without giving an option, and I end up with dozens of pictures."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Google Photos is a great app for backing up your information and being able to access info from other platforms. Very easy to use and well organized. All file formats can be saved including RAW files. You choose yourself on what to backup instead of everything being backed up for you. Creating your own folders is a plus. Storage pricing is not outrageous. Great App. ad free is awesome.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So apparently, I just booted up Photos, only to be met with the ""Drive files are no longer viewable"" message. I DO want to know why they did this, but that's the least of my worries right now. Either my phone's screen is too small (which I doubt), or it's because the message can't be scrolled, but now I can't hit the ""got it"" button to close the message, meaning that now I'm stuck on this text box, unable to access my files. Even the back button on the phone doesn't close it. Good job, Google."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall, am very pleased with the quality & clarity of the pictures. My only complaint is when taking pictures of the early evening sky where there is a planet (Venus) and try to get a closer picture, the quality & clarity of the photos breaks up into a blotchy, grainy, unnatural-colored mess. Other night time photos could be much better."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's ok. Generally I avoid pouring work into a Google product just so they can change it every 3 months and then remove support and kill it after the years, but with the space I get with my pixel and my previous picture cloud having a user experience so bad we ended up with duplicates and almost lost photos a few times, that it's the best option currently. So far it's been fairly easy to manage so can't complain."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"From the getgo, it doesn't back up the photos in my gallery by folders... it just puts them ALL in the same pot, probably by date, but really scrambled: Camera with Whatsup and etc. It's a mess!! It also has no option to MOVE photos into folders, only copy them, so still the same mess, and the process itself takes long. I also want to move photos back to my gallery for better editing or sharing, but there isn't such an option. I stopped the app and will be looking for smth else."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"UI is just horrible on every level. There have been no significant improvements in years. How is it possible that Google with all its might can produce such a thing, I have no clue... Looking for ways to move to other services. Using it feels like crudely designed, limited and overly simplistic appliance UI for a quickly assembled prototype from another time. I've been asked to provide a detailed feedback but the app review process is not designed for that either. 500 characters and text only."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"You cannot edit the photos themselves- no cropping, no coloring, no fine tuning of pictures. You have to download another app for that, then upload any of those pics that you want on to your Google photo drive phone app. You can't do anything on your phone... If you want quality photos, you need a different app to begin with.... Too many steps. However, the storage is amazing! And I love the organization."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Overall a good app, everything is set out clear. The only problem I have is the ""stylized"" photos which are done automatically always look far better. You cannot easily achieve the same level of editing manullay which is annoying... The ""Auto"" filter just makes your pictures brighter when in reality I want a photo that looks similar the automatic and random ""stylized"" photos google does for you."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"If you're photos/videos aren't backing up, go to your device settings and search ""optimize battery"" and switch it off for Photos. Google support won't tell you about this setting, so don't bother asking. They wasted hours of my time suggesting it was a defective device, unrelated to android OS. Also, they need a better way of organizing albums that match up with your device albums."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I use Google photos everyday and find the editing tools useful. I love the prompts to review old photos and suggestions for improving pictures. It's a great app that I wouldn't want to be without. I'm not worried about the recent cap on free storage. I back up all my photos and videos to my PC and an external hard drive. All the cap means, when I finally reach the limit, is that I won't be able to view all my pictures on my phone... or at least not without paying, which I'm unlikely to do."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Remember that photo from ten years ago with a t-rex in the background? Search T-rex and find it instantly*. The pick a still photo from a 5-second motion capture and auto adjust lighting feature seems to work better than all competitors which is nice for this casual photographer who just wants photos that look good and are easy to find when you want to show friends. Honestly, this app keeps teaching me new features that are now essential. *assuming your photos aren't full of T-rexes."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app, but could br a bit better in terms of adding old photos to the library. For example, if I add a single photo (that has a date) from a folder that is not in sync, then it goes with the date of today. This is very frustrating... Gets worst because the only way to fix that is by using the app on the PC.. But overall, it is a great app"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Basic gallery app, connects to the Google drive, however, as soon as you try to start arranging your photos.. First things first, It took me awhile to find the photos not taken directly with the camera, it's device folders or something in the menu. Second, when moving photos from file to file, there's a huge bug. The photos will sometimes still appear to be there, even though they've been moved, and if you delete the old ones, both are gone. Works, but it's buggy and far too product focused."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Oh dear Google! Reading the latest reviews, your people seemed to have ruined a good app. I have to agree. I used to love the editing functions. They used to be really easy to use. Not anymore. Nothing is intuitive. Scrolling options take time/effort with next options being off screen. Scrolling is not responsive, options hard to select, and often jump between features. Haptic feedback is totally unnecessary, irritating, and drains my battery, and I've not yet found how to turn it off."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Irritating. I don't like this app messing with the configuration and content of my images, video and albums and suggesting and creating things I don't want. Frustrating. Turning off system settings isn't 100% effective. An intrusive pain in the a***!! And the default message ""you're missing out"" is incredibly annoying appearing every time I want to access my library. No FOMO here!! Stop interferring with my image storage Google. Absolute PITA!! üò§"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"giving it a 3/5 1. photos I download don't immediatly back up and i have to manually back each individual photo up. 2. sometimes when zooming in, a photo quality drops. 3. just a minor gripe, but as a person who draws frequently, i usually use references for things I'm having trouble with and I think it would be more helpful to be able to display multiple pictures at a time like you can on a computer, as it's a hassles constantly cycling through photos when i need a specific references."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Photos has improved quite a bit in the past year. Previous issues with syncing across devices have been resolved. Still slow to recognize new faces and necessary rotations though. One improvement I would like to see is the ability to create Photobooks with more photos. Some complain there is no way to save movies created in Photos. This is easily accomplished using the Share button and saving the video to your Google Drive, Onedrive, etc."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Love it!! Almost no complaints! Although I've been having a problem with downloading images. Sometimes they'll duplicate and the duplicit will be somewhere random in my main gallery on the app and other times I'll just accidentally download the same image twice (I don't know whether it's a bug or me) It'd be nice if there was some tool that could help us find duplicate images so bloat could be more easily managed.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a really good app for storage and basic editing. (I mean BASIC) You can make colleges but limited to the way the app arranges it and the number of photos in the collage. For editing there are way better apps out there. You can create picture books and other stuff, but you have to pay. If all you want is storage, it's as good as any other app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I never use it, but it cannot be uninstalled so it's just wasting storage space. Worse than useless. Edit: forced to use it for a while after switching phones. It's even worse than I thought. It nags about enabling rubbish google services, lacks configuration options, fails to show all images on my device... If I could rate it even lower, I would."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"They thought of everything You could make collages, short animations, movies, albums. You could even order a nice photo album for a pretty cheap price. I haven't actually gotten the photo album ( I haven't finished) so I can't speak on the quality of the pages but when I do get one i'll edit this review . I'm also considering buying the photo canvas for wall decoration. They also let you buy a photo if you want to have a hard copy just because. I originally got this app to have back up for phone"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Slow, difficult to navigate. I hate the new format of the app. Makes it very difficult to navigate. I get pop up notifications of color pops etc, but when I open the app, can never find them. Also much slower. This is a horrible direction for the app. Please adjust to make more usable and easier to navigate in finding pics from Google Assistant (color pops, collages, etc)"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Backing up unlimited photos, having a history of all photos on cloud, with reminder of tossing already stored photos to save space locally on drive, and sharing with a partner is great. however having annoying repetitive bugs and slow processing of the automated backup search. (""getting photos ready for backup"") goes on forever sometimes. its a bug when you have images on your SD card that have the same folder name as your default stored photo foldername. as well unknown reasons."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Best gallery to have ever existed! I just wish the quality was even better when storing the photos. When I zoom on my computer, all the edges are blurred or pixeled! I love high quality images, and this is the only thing that's bothering me with this app, otherwise, everything else is top notch. Make the quality better and it's a 10 out of 5 stars!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new update to memories is terrible. The photos now have some sort of dynamic zoom so the photo won't stand still. Google now hides the Android navigation bar so that you have to use the unnatural vertical swipe navigation they've recently introduced, and can't easily navigate out. The feel is unnatural because a timeline is intuitively horizontal, not vertical. And in any case Android is mostly a horizontal navigation scheme. Please change it back. If it ain't broke don't fix it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,i love this app because if you accidentally deleted a photo it will be in achrive. you can free up more space but still have all your photos on your phone. i love that it suggests albums to put image into. it creates collages and other features like this. you can create your own albums so you can put everything into individual categories making life easier when someone asks to see a particular photo but doesn't want to see you messing around. it has features where you can adjust/ play around...
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app for viewing, and photo storage.Meta-data on each photo a useful feature. I strongly suggest that you choose ""Original Photo"" in the storage options if you are wanting to print at any point. Otherwise, the quality is significantly downgraded which is also the case in using ""Google photo editor"". I find it useful to use a different editing app, making sure to preserve the original..."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app does a great job with allowing for easy storage and viewing of photos. The built in image processing features are limited but very good. I only wish it had a photo stitching tool you could use instead of just the ones the program sometimes selects. The ""on this day"" feature where photos from that day in a previous year are displayed is a great feature and sometimes pick me up, as seeing cool vacation photos from past years on that day can help when slogging through a boring work day."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Goggle Photos. There are so many great features to the app like edits, collages, 3D images, tools like erase Photoshop, easy to share photos to a single person or a group of people. Google lens is amazing! I've also printed out images from the app and they came out beautiful. I like how you can edit the photos time and date. The only issues I've had with the app is that it freezes sometimes. I also wish that you can fast forward videos frame by frame without having to click on edit."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Usually good, but every update breaks it more. After editing photos, either with the markup tool or by cropping them, I can't save the changes. The ""done"" button exists, but nothing happens when you press it. Can't uninstall/reinstall as it's a system app. Tried force stopping it and clearing the cache. Nope. I wish there was the option to install the previous version of the app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So as I said in my previous review and feedback that I sent to Google. New user interface is PAIN in the *ss. I no longer can go to the app and quickly access pictures saved on my SD, see my screenshot folder. In the old version you had on left hand side all the folders just like you would have in folder explorer. UNINSTALLED the app after years of use. Thanks Google team! You've become Microsoft 2. You don't listen to your users so they leave. It's so simple. You can't force this on us."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This application is really good at least my photos are now safe and available across all my devices. I have 2 observations that I would like Google to think about; 1. The app needs to have ability to find and show us duplicate photos in the case of duplicate photos with an option to either delete one, all or skip. 2. In the album section, it would be nice if only photos that do not belong to any group will be shown. For some with so many albums it's difficult to arrange photos based on albums."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I give this app 4 stars because it's almost perfect. I really like that you can easily have your photos printed at a local Walgreens or cvs from the app and either mailed to you or set for pick up. But my one complaint is that it is waaaay to hard to organize your photos into albums. The app will automatically group your photos but not the way I want and for the most part they are organized by the date. Coming from Samsung Gallery which is super customizable, this was a bit of a let down."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Pictures and albums randomly disappear. I don't like that albums will create in my drive and then I can't move them out. Changed my original rating from two stars to one star. Frustrated that my pictures and albums are GONE! Nope, following those steps not helpful and doesn't explain the disappearance of photos from albums. I tried reaching out to the contact you provided and was responded with the e mail isn't monitored. I've lost pictures I'll never be able to replace."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the throwbacks and highlight hours, always brings a smile to my face. The storage in albums is super convenient and the photo editor is super easy to use! I've had this one issue, I have auto backup, and I don't want it to save my downloads and screenshots, is there a way to not delete those, but unsave? I hope there is, because my backup limit is maxed out, and I wanna keep my photos safe!! Other than that, its a great app! I love you Google!! <3"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app has been pretty awesome as far as accessing photos, organization, and the creative aspects! Some of the suggested edits are goofy, but overall there is a lot of cool stuff you can do to photos. I also enjoy the ""rediscover this day"" feature. It's fun to see what you've been up to on a specific date in the past without scrolling endlessly or searching folders. I haven't gone too in depth, but the stuff I have come across is neat!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used my Google account for several years without issue. Then suddenly, my storage is full. Turns out Google photos had been doing backups without me knowing. I deactivated that and deleted all pictures to free up space. A few weeks later, the same issue with my storage, even though I turned the backups off. I turned it off again, and when I tried deleting the pictures, they were also deleted from my phone. I am not buying more storage, I don't need it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love it!! the stylized photos it makes for you are cool but it seems to only like black and white style. it also uses the same song for the movie it puts together with your photos, every time without fail same song and same black and white photos. other than that i don't see any problem with the app. (Google pixel 2 XL)"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very good and useful app. Perhaps it's my lack of knowledge, but I really have a hard time going back to and finding the right folder to put a picture in because it creates so many additional folders on its own. Also I wish it just simply had a search function so you could search for a folder that you known the name of rather than have to scroll through and find it. I love the app and I love the fact that you can load up a minimized version of the files with unlimited storage."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I really like the collage, stylised photos, how it groups them, and it's just smart, good algorithm!! I am giving it 1 star because I was very disappointed to know that as of june 2021 the free and unlimited backup is changing: I'm not sure, but only really low resolution photos (blurry, thumbnails, not the ""low"" standard one any more) will be backed up in the free and unlimited option."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I instantly, regret, paying for storage, just to see how bad this is when it comes to selecting photos and overall systems compared to the actual gallery from the original device. I got no time to select one by one randomly, and the thing is, when I tried to copy my photos from my album to this app, it turns out the folder placed in my internal device, not the app, that now, all the date of the photos are messed up. Change your systems, it's complicated and disappointing."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I am used to this app uploading almost immediately from my phone, and count on that. But for the last few days, possibly since a recent update, it is not working. The app says it has 77 items left and it is 'Getting ready to back up', but the little blue circle circles, then changes to an up arrow, then circles again, and nothing uploads. I can individually click the upload icon on a single picture, and it will upload. But the automated backup has been broken for a few days now. I have tried clearing the cache, restarting the phone, etc., but it just no longer works."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I don't understand what this app is doing ‚Äì or attempting to do. Why are entire folders disappearing from the ""Library""; or only some images in a particular folder show up in the app (say I have 90, but Photos says I have 80!)? I'm sure there's a reason, but it's hardly evident or intuitive. This app has gotten entirely too unwieldy, especially if you're not interested in backing up or ""free up space""."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely üòªLOVEüòª the Google Photos Application. I've never experienced an issue while using this app. I strongly recommend downloading it fully onto your device. You are able to archive any and ALL your photos and video clips as well as back them up. Backing up your photos is a very important thing... say someone stole your phone, or you lost your phone, maybe you just bought a new phone, maybe you don't have enough memory on the device, well, that's okay because Google Photos can back it up"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Rather awkward for anything but very basic stuff. If you need to save or view a couple of pictures it's fine, and the backup functions are convenient, but the moment you are dealing with more than that, it becomes ridiculously clumsy. There is no way to tell which pictures come from where (is this mine or did I import it from a friend's library?), which ones are taking up space in your storage, no easy way to bulk select and archive groups of pictures... Needs much love."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm not sure what's going on. Basically I had all my photos in specific folders with names in ""library"" now all of a sudden, there's only a couple of folders in there with only afew pictures in them. It's very annoying. I had them in certain folders to help me find pictures easier, now when I try and make a new folder to sort them out again, it's separate from the other folders... I'm so confused and annoyed"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It is much more complicated to download photos and videos to my PC than the one on my last Nokia. I can't see the benefit of using a small screen to edit photos and I don't want a phone camera app modifying my photos willy nilly, Why can't you keep things simple rather than feeling the need to be innovative where it is not necessary? I want to have complete autonomy of how my photos are enhanced (or not enhanced)."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It keeps saying it has stopped working and I can't even upload or download pictures, documents and videos. Sometimes I will download a picture or video and just about minutes after viewing, the video can't play and the pictures are blurred. It is a very useless and irritating app, I try to uninstall it but it is just there. Google can't answer when I send a complaint."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Some functions are not helpful - the enhanced images for example. The function that's supposed to help you add photos to a folder is not operable if you only want one image in the folder. It puts every photo - no matter how many images are in the photo, instead of the one you really want - then you have to redo everything. Photo enhancements are not great - you're missing sharpening and down lighting. Even this dictation is difficult because it's so slow."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is really important to me. My previous phone had issues where it had gone under a factory reset without my knowledge. I was devastated because I had so many memories on my old phone of precious times, and did not have a way to ever recover them. With this app, in the spotlight albums specifically, I am so grateful that Google is able to recount anniversaries of pictures and videos and give them back to me so I can save and have them once again. I look forward to its improvements üòä"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love it. You can store photos and vidoes all in one place I like it when Google Photo does touch ups or stylisers. The effects you can use are both funny and they have some serious ones depending on the mood of the photo. Or you don't have to change a thing. The ease accessability and options for different ways of sharing is a great tool. I personally recommend this app no questions. Well to be honest I already have, Oh! I forgot to mention the best part ..PEOPLE IT'S FREE."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love being able to share an album with many people. Unfortunately there are so many issues that occur and some weird features as well. So many times it's happened to me that I try to upload photos to an album and receive a notification that they were uploaded but in reality it didn't work. This will happen for days. The help says to uninstall and reinstall but when you do, it takes days for Photos to find all your photos and shared albums with no certainty that the original issue was fixed."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The Memories ""feature"" bloats the screen, cannot be removed, and will sometimes automatically play video if I accidentally open it. It seems like every update, there's a new ""feature"" introduced which serves only to make navigating the app more frustrating. I don't want the app to be organized by what it thinks I want to see. Make those ""features"" be something people can turn on if they need it, not something that is on by default and can never be removed."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very annoying app. Why would they think I want to see a stylised version of some photo I have taken? I have better things to do than keep looking at their version of a photo. Do I want to see a panoramic view of say, something to do with DIY or something technical. Quite apart from the continuous pinging of my phone. Google, we are not all young geeks welded to our mobiles. Stop it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I like this app. Used it for years. Have thousands of photos on it. Back up is great: quick and easy so space is not taken up on my phone. The only thing I wish they would change is in the album aspect. I sort alot of my photos into many categories for tasks and it is such a frustration to scroll through 20+ albums when they seem to be in no type of order. If you could select how you wanted them to display (by name etc and some recent at the top) that would be GREAT üòâüòÅüòâ Thank you Google!
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's an excellent app to store all photos and videos I just wish the option of deleting images from phone once it was backed up was more efficient. I don't want to delete everything from my phone perhaps just specific folders that have been backed up. I made the mistake once of deleting everything and it messed up my entire photo filing system on my phone. Needs to be more user friendly.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love many of the Google Photos tools that make it easy to make animations or manipulate photos in certain ways. I wish there was a more robust way to create slides how's or edit videos and stitch them together. Also, I wish there was a post-production way of doing what's common in many phones today, like the fast-forward time-lapse videos and such."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Aside from the fact that Google wants everyone to have their own phone (and therefore no way to select which account photos need to go to) satisfied. Disappointed it started out free with unlimited storage.... and like everything else, ""free"" and ""unlimited"" are repeatedly redefined. Not shocked or surprised, just disappointed in the lack of dedication to original customers. Quality is good, dependability and consistency have room for improvement."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is great, but i would like some modifications. For archive suggestions, there should be a way to select some to archive and some to delete. Right now it is all or nothing. When adding photos to an album, it would be better of we could search specific albums by typing rather than always scrolling through all the albums. On this app at least i cam sort alphabetically. I don't see that option so it is really annoying to add photos to albums. I'd like to move photos to other albums."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have tried this, it still doesn't work.. Using the ""Add+"" to move or copy photos or videos to an existing folder doesn't work. It only creates a different ""Folder"" from the existing one. So, it's difficult to move photos or videos from my device to an external SD. It wasn't like this before, this issue came up after several updates and I am quite sure many users have not noticed this. Everything was fine before now."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Creating an album on your phone automatically syncs all content to the cloud, even with backup and sync turned off. It does this with no warning and absolutely no way to stop the process once it has started. I'm now sitting here watching my phone upload hundreds of photos and gigabytes of video without my consent, taking up all my bandwidth and absolutely draining my battery. Deleting the album off the phone doesn't stop the process, and turning off data, wi-fi, or the phone only delays it until they are turned back on. Plus Google has helpfully decided to place a banner of ads for their paid printing service right at the top of the library tab, instead of hiding it away in an options menu where it belongs. The average user would, 99.99% of the time, be going to the library tab to find a photo or set of photos to view at the moment, not pay $10 to have a photobook of the pictures printed and mailed to them the next week, so why is it the first thing you see in your library?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm super disappointed with the developers of this app. It would be great if there was an option to upload specific photos of your phone's gallery to a specific album in Google photos. Everyone I know keeps their photos organized, but this app makes it impossible. It uploads all your photos into 1 bucket of pictures and then you have to reorganize all over again. Who has time for that? Also, there is no option to ""select all"" photos, and photo storage affects your email storage. Ridiculous."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"There are few things that I like about this app. Not ""a few"" ... ""very few"". First thing: I had the WORST time syncing things so that they would show up on my computer/desktop, from my phone. When I realised they weren't syncing, there were over 5000 photos to sync (I take a lot, and edit a lot). So then I try to sync them. For the life of me, I can't get them to sync over. So... I start searching. Seems like a few people (that I could find) had the same problem. The fix? I had to shut off my wi-fi, turn on the sync over data option, go back in, then it starts syncing, so I turn the wi-fi on again... it goes for about 250-350 photos... so I think... cool - it's working. NOPE. It goes back to the ""preparing backup"" spinning circle of death. So then I do the same thing. And it works again. Then it gets stuck again. So far I think I've done it about 12 or 15 times... and I still have over 2100 photos to do. So - THAT'S annoying. Second... I have to agree with someone else here, on their low review. WHY, when you delete a phone from Google Photos, does it delete on the stock photo app of the phone as well. Oh and I dislike the editing feature as well - it's very limited. But now maybe I'm just getting picky..."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like the app, but I have a problem. The descriptions of the photos are not good all the time. They used to get mix up. When I scroll down each picture to make a description and I directly go to the next picture because of the same to do, after some descriptions they do not fit exactly when I finished. If I check the descriptions one by one, I see a lot of troubles. So I need to use this method to avoid mistakes: after one description I am going back to album and I choose another picture."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Deleted Google photos app, and determined that the duplication continued, is apparently caused by something else. Not sure what it is, but it seems random. I know Google wants to promote their app, but I would much prefer that the sharing functionality under Google photos didn't prefer their app to 30% of the screen. It's annoying, I never use it, and there's no way to get rid of it. Original post: Randomly duplicates photos from time to time. Annoying."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Once deleted from a device, the photos stay in the app's cloud. Ironically, deleting a photo from the cloud also deletes the same from any synced devices (regardless of the ones already deleted ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), without an option to save those. Additionally, there seems to be a lack of a select all option when deleting a large batch of photos from the cloud. That is when using the phone to do so. If using a PC/laptop makes it possible, I wouldn't know and I'm not interested in doing so."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Horrible app! disable it NOW It took all my photos from my phone and said it would ""free up space by deleting a few photos"". I thought it would only be a few useless photos and it said they would be backed up anyway. WIPED MY PHONE It didn't back up any photos either. Luckily I recovered them later on, but it was horrible because of the suspense. I had important photos on it nad it seemed as if they were gone. This app is a waste of time. disable it NOW."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Just started having problems with the app. All of my photos started flashing, and it took about 30 minutes for the flashing to stop. After the flashing ended, all of the dates the photos were organized by were wrong. I tried restarting my phone, force stopping the app, disabling the app, nothing worked. I tried to uninstall, and I get a message saying I cannot uninstall the app because it came preinstalled on the phone. Now I am forced to look for another app to use. Rediculous!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Bad UX. Saved a modified version of a not-so-recent photo from an album? Good luck finding it ever again in the whole feed. Trying to export a photo to another folder so that it's easier to find in other apps? You can't. Upload dialog blocking UI waiting for network? Tough luck, now you can't use the app until you have network again or kill it. Can't add selection of photos to more than one album. Can't see what albums a photo is already part of."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I very happy to photo that, While I love google photos. thought were long gone show up on here, made me very happy to see memories pop back up as well. Very good app just amazing. I organize my photos in album, and while the 'search' functionality is great, it is easier to locate photos if you know in which album to look for them. Yes, if one misses on putting a few photos in album, accidentally then it is very difficult to find them even with 'search' please google figure this simple thing out!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've deleted the app. It's nearly impossible to keep it from deleting photos I want on my SD card, but not in Google photos. Google photos essentially holds your photos hostage until you buy more space. Amazon has free photo storage for photos. Only need Google for backing up videos, but if I connect my SD card, it starts deleting photos I want to keep on my SD card. I've tried every workaround. If I want to add photos or video to a family group, it starts deleting from my SD. Can't trust it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's nice place to store photos. Use to have a great video maker, but they have down graded it. Can't choose the music or put a title on it like you use to be able to do. But now it deletes videos/slide shows that you try to create. So you definitely can't use it as and video editor! Very disappointed, expescially because I spent 30mins putting a video together, go to save it, It spins for 5mins and then they just deleted it!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this app! Automatically uploads all of my pictures and videos. Keeps me organized. Keeps my phone clean and free of clutter. And, the assistant reminds you of memories from years ago to look back on from that day. That's probably one of my favorite features! You can organize yourself even further by creating albums to put all your uploaded pics & videos into. (I think there's a way to purchase them too!) The best part, once uploaded, you can view them from ALL of your devices!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very bad, did not like it so i uninstalled it and lost all my photos in the TRASH bin some of which i wanted to restore. If you want to try the update, at least back up your trash photos to hard drive, not in the cloud, you might loose them. Admittedly this will only apply to a small percentage of the updaters, but it seems to be a bug that people need to be warned about until it can be fixed. Some of my TRASH bin photos had at least 50 days to go before they were supposed to be auto deleted."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Just cracking the surface! I'm sure I'm not using Google photos to its fullest potential! But, so far I really like how all my photos are being handled! Makes it easy to post with, send a link after putting a group together! without taking up so much space, and take forever to send each pic one by one! I really like the layout with date and location already there! Even though, it feels weird thinking they know where I'm at all the time! probably would worry more if i was a crook.. lol!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a wonderful app, just like the classic gallery with some extra abilities. The only thing I've a problem with is it's always a challenge to try and get all of the photos I want to save over to my SD card. there seems to be no way to do that unless I'm missing something. Other than me worrying about needless outside storage I guess I'm pretty satisfied with the Goog's photo apps. üôÇüôÇ"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a fantastic app!!! I can find a specific photo easily just writing what I want to see! My photos are automatically organized in folders. It is able to identify faces and show me every moments that the person appers in my albums. It adds location and organizes everything by date and local!! It also makes movies, collage and albums to share with a friend!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm pretty happy with the Service, but the App has some hangups. - The backup status often fails to update or be Accurate at all, falsely representing that you're fully backed up and not actually the reason nothing will load on anything. - When uploading it shuts down my entire home network because the app uses every bit of the upload bandwidth. - Even when fully synchronized, organizing photos (adding to albums, archiving) has a delay, and sometimes never processes, causing errors and aberrations. - I've requested a checkbox on the Add-to-Album screen to simultaneously archive the same media, so you don't have to find them twice."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a great photo managing app. Best parts are the automated albums! I love how when I take photos, it can tell who is in them, cats included! I have both of my cats names set in the app, and it can tell when I take a picture of either of them and label it correctly! The UI is intuitive, and the suggestions it provides are actually useful. It is now my goto photo app (even better than the built in gallery), and it'll help keep photos backed up if my phone ever dies or if I get a new one."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love this app! I make sure to hook up my phone whenever I get a new one. It has saved so many great memories when my old phones have died suddenly and I haven't been able to get them off of the old phone. Plus if I want to put an old photo back on my phone for whatever reason I can. All it makes great suggestions for animations and other things. LOVE it!
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app has been a lifesaver. All of those photos I just assumed were history because i never took the time to save them to disk or to the cloud, Google Photos had my back. It even restored pictures from years back when it was Picasa. It's the only way I was able to win a 10 thousand dollar lawsuit. No glitches with any of the many phones I've had (and lost or destroyed). Nothing fancy, just reliable."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Lost all my folders when I decided to free up space and ended up with a single gallery with all my images. Doesn't support batch actions, quick selection of multiple images by swiping (need to tap every single image), rearrangement of Folders by name and many other features a basic gallery app should include. Edit: Face tagging needs some time to work, but its good. Search function is fantastic. Suggested animations, movies, books etc. also really good."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app does everything right except one very irritating problem. Importing photos directly from your phone works, but it DOES NOT import the photos by album. Photos are all chronologically in order, which is good. Nonetheless still a complete mess when you want to find specific photos in all in one album that you have created before the import. Very inconvenient. Had to scroll more than 2 thousand photos in order to create the albums before the import. Just very annoying."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I appreciate Google photos being generally integrated and easy to use, but I hate the new layout. It's so cumbersome to edit your photos. I have keyboard sound and touch feedback turned off, but changing a dial on this app and it causes the phone to vibrate. I think some of the light settings are too narrowly clamped, I'd like to have more control and the option to save unique filter settings."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Let's just say that someone likes to play with editing features, but knows nothing about how that works. the colors are way off. You're using too much color concentration. I don't like that. so far, most of your features are just not up to par with my own ability to edit my own photos, so it's really just crowding my little device so that i must delete things that I'd rather keep. i hope you find a better photo editor."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Who would have thought a photo app would make you want to come back more and more. I love the app, there is always something to do. Whether its look through timelines, memories or clearing out blurry photos and cleaning up your storage. It's super intelligent and always improving. The developers obviously care about the experience and use the app themselves"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A great app. Quick to sync, as a Pixel user unlimited storage is nice. :) Can take a while to get use to the structure and the full features. Future Changes -Would like to see a way to lock certain pictures/videos within an album that requires authentication. Even for something as simple as your passport scanned, having the option to make it ""locked"" would be great. (not that it is actually locked, but you know what I mean. :)"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I love the ability to back up for free. Unfortunately, as somebody that likes to take the occasional video, that 20 gigs of storage fills up within an hour. I don't want to back up videos to the cloud, yet I don't see any option to disable it so I'm left with filling up the storage with 1-4 videos. Nothing else backing up until I transfer and delete them from Google photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The dates have been so out of sync for the last few days. I've had to look through photos in a certain month that are actually dated from a month or so before. Today though, photos past a certain year just refuse to load, and when I try to scroll to the bottom it stops at March 2011 even though I have photos dated from 1986. This is on top of the ongoing issue I've had with the facial recognition which ignores my settings. I've had to correct & remove the same photos countless times."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There's no way of contacting customer support. So if anything goes wrong, you're totally screwed. For that reason, go with another photo cloud service. My backup won't work. I've tried EVERYTHING, even uninstalling and reinstalling the app. It's been over a month! I pay for 100gb, and have used less than 35gb, but can't get the backup to work. Their help section only discusses how to buy more storage!!! So basically they're really concerned about getting your $, not about a working product"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A great app for automatically backing up my photos and videos. The prompt suggestions for enhanced photos, videos, and animations is a big plus. It would've been better if Google added a prompt for photo or video duplicate so that it would be easier for users to organize their library and created albums."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Embarrassing, really. The whole photo management is terrible, it doesn't even look like Google. You're unable to select files, move them to selected folders and archive them in one go. You need to create your selection again after each action. Also, it's impossible to know if the photos in the main directory are saved in the albums, unless you open the albums themselves. As a photo management app it doesn't do the job. This app should be developed based on the great functionalities of the Gmail."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hey I really like this app. The name and all the features I almost rate 4 because of one thing. It's because I take the time to sort my pics into albums. Oftentimes, I'm at work and need to open the app while a client or coworker is able to see my screen before I can change to the tab that has the folders listed. This is always risky because the app always opens to a page that shows all of my recent pics. I would just love it to have the option to open to my listed folders rather than my recents"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I suddenly am unable to make a movie with Google Photos. Slow to download my clips, and once a movie is made, it plays back as though my video clips were still pictures. The problem has been going on for over 2 months. Done all the trouble shooting even down to replacing my phone. The issue is happening on my husband's phone, too. Google has been no help in fixing the issue so far."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,A decent app for basic photo editing and mostly storage if you don't care about the size/resolution. It has a few downsides: 1) Like batch editing (like in Picasa) to auto-enhance selected photos. 2) Sorting by Albums is a miss; need much more fine-grained controls. 3) Need a lot more filters than what is available. 4) The steps to upload from Drive suck big time; requires unnecessary clicks and the window that pops up cannot be resized. 5) No option to directly save/download Photos to my Phone.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Used to be great. Now hard to find photos with newest update. Used to let you choose all photos from the same day to make albums. Not any longer, now have to click one by one. Used to be able to easily find shared photos at bottom of screen. Now much more difficult to find older photos, albums, etc. No longer makes little movies or memes. The last update was terrible. I wish there was a way to undo it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I can't live without this app, at this point. All around one of better Google services, with just a few hiccups. The biggest one is inability to delete photos directly from albums, which would be really practical. At this stage, you cam only remove them from albums and then delete them directly from all photos list, which could be quite a messy business, especially if yor album photos are not on the same date."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's nice. Though it's not like Picasa albums which was more intuitive. Backup in Google photos is a difficult or ungainly experience. It doesn't seem to be happen, rather it happens - occasionally with no control over it. I have thousands of photos that I am unable to backup. Google support has not been useful in this regard."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google photos is a fantastic app for organizing, editing, and sharing your photos. The suggestion aspect of the editing is very helpful to show you what's possible with your photos üì∑ I also really like when I get a notification that Google did something fancy with one of my photos, very cool üòé My only suggestion is a way to delete photos faster. I take a lot of pictures from my car every day and it takes a while to figure out what are keepers and which ones aren't. Overall I love this app!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I recently was making a slideshow of screenshots I had taken. I permanently deleted the screen shots once I was done because I FIGURED that I wouldn't need them. Well, turns out, that's not possible! I tried to open the slideshow once after I deleted the screenshots and then all the screenshots I had deleted were gone! So now, I have to start over with the slideshow. This was an entire hour of my time that I will never get back. Thanks a lot, google."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this App for 3years now, and it's been good to me. But for now it's been two months, the App doesn't backup photos but backup is always on. I don't know how to fix this problem, I've tried several ways but still the same it's just showing, [""Backup Paused"" and ""Waiting for Connection""] it just needs Wifi to back up automatically, I can't use my Personal Data,... NB: it's not everybody who uses WiFi with their phones some of us use personal data."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"One big pro for me is the feature to search for photos. But I absolutely hate the it doesn't move the picture when you create an album, it just creates a duplicate. I would organize my whole camera roll if it meant I could find the pictures after, but it's impossible to tell if a photo has been put into an album or not already. This makes everything very messy. I try to just use the photo feature on my phone (which I generally prefer) but then I change a device and stuck with Google photos again"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The App itself is very, very useful and the organization system through folders and tags is extremely helpful and convenient. My biggest complaints are that Google Photos shouldn't automatically make special folders for you based off of themes such as skies, food, dogs, cats, cars etc. Most of these folders are themes that I don't really care about (like planes) and even though the app can be accurate in finding the right photos, It ususally ends up producing some unfitting combinations."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Link sharing doesn't work since the May update. I used to be able to share links to photos, but now ""share link"" automatically creates an album and shares that instead. And THAT causes errors. Now I need to figure out how to check the version number, uninstall Google Photos, find the previous version number, find where to download it, and hope that works."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely recommend Google photos to anyone who's looking for an option that offers all the different features consisted within this app. You can hide your photos, create movies, view their recommendations, identify a specific person to create their own album and much more. To top it off it's absolutely free. I purchase additional storage but I'm one that only utilizes the phone as means to take pictures. Thank you for such a phenomenal option to choose when looking for the best app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've had some issues in the past with this app duplicating photos, the dates of the photos glitching, losing some descriptions on photos, but all in all it's been very reliable over the many years I've used it. I love how easy the sharing feature is and the new editing options available. You probably won't find a better photos app than this one."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The product is quite fantastic in the way it operates. My only concern is typical with many similar apps, and that is that there is a lack of clarity and control with regards to how the app operates, where and how the files are kept and the way in which alternative email addresses manage the files. Far too much is lacking from app menus that guide the user into how he wants to manage the content."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"OnePlus 7 Pro. There are bugs to be worked out. Now when i try to set wallpaper for the new Android 10 on the 7 pro, i get distortion in the images. Vertical stretch, and horizontal compression, I've tried restarting and changing the way I saved the photo and different parts of the photo. I'm sure there are other bugs but i haven't found anything else yet."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There are no settings that allow photos to be stored on my SD card, so this app has taken over the storage on my phone. Until that problem is resolved, there's no point in reviewing anything else. I have sent an email to Google.if this issue is successfully resolved, I will write review this app. If it's not resolved, I'm uninstalling and will find another photo storage app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is not at all user friendly! I had over a thousand photos, painstakingly organized into Albums. My phone died and this new phone uses Google Photos. I transferred all my photos. Instantly it arranged them by date! Aaaaggghhh! Years worth of work lost! POS program! Now I can't find anything! Then that phone had an issue and when I redownload my pictures, they suddenly can't find my pictures! I have seven pictures now. I should NEVER have trusted them with my pictures."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app was amazing, and then they recently changed it and it no longer is intuitive. Getting rid of the Assistant tab was a huge mistake. Now I can't find my shared albums or the auto-generated collages and stuff. I don't know why everything always has to be messed with, when it already works. Fixing things until they're broken, all in the name of newness, is the new norm, and it's frustrating."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have this app for about 6 years though out multiple phones, tablets, computers, and laptops. This is stores every photo I've ever taken and even backs up photos from other apps. The best part of this app would be that it can save you a lot of storage space. The app automatically backs up all of your photos and has an option where you can delete the photos from your phone but still have access to them instantly! Of course the edits and suggestions are an incredible feature as well!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Awesome app, very much set and forget and it picks up all my pictures off my device, gives me so much confidence knowing I won't lose any important pictures if something happened. I also love the stylise feature where occasionally google applys a filter to some of your pictures, it also has an auto stitch function if it detects you've taken a few pictures of the same area giving you panorama effect photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Takes care of my photos just as I always pictured them to be taken care of. Makes custom, and organized help to collect, and group for each purpose of placement for all type, and named project. Still learning as doors, and Windows continually shuffle to new, and improved possibilities. The truth in us all is shown in the end by stability of partnership by what integrity is standing on."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is great as a cloud service. My problems with it are that when you delete photos they sometimes come back, the fact that my phone's normal gallery has more editing options and that you can't edit the date of more then one picture at a time outside the web. I like how easy it is to understand the UI and that every photo loads fast."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a great, easy to use app. All available features work well, and the search function/AI is great at what it does. I find the lack of ability to hide/sort/organise into folders out of the main folder to be an issue, as there are almost always photos that we'd rather hide from people when scrolling through our photos with someone together on the phone screen. Add this feature (separate album folders, or at least a hidden folder function) and I'd give 5 stars."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I feel like the Photos app from Google doesn't get the recognition it deserves. It's one of those things that we just take for granted. But as part of the Pixel infrastructure, the app is aces. From the ability to easily search by timeline, to the robust editing tools that can make any photo look professional-grade, this app truly delivers. Great job devs!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have used this app for years, through several iPhone/Android switches and vise versa, and for simple use once my phone began to run out of space, and this app has never been one to disappoint. Just a friendly reminder though - if you plan on uploading your images and videos here, and then delete them, be absolutely sure to triple-check that they're synced. GP syncs photos through their ""albums"" and they don't naturally get synced at times, so I cannot emphasize enough to check what gets synced"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Overall a fun app for manipulating your cell phone photos. Intuitive to use and apply filters, rotate, crop, etc. Makes sharing easy. Also it automatically offers up stylized versions of your pix as well as collages and animations. Update September 2020: with each app update it seems that there are fewer features available to edit my photos. Am really annoyed with the ""order photo"" prompt that appears when you pull up every picture. Stop trying to sell me stuff, you're already mining my data."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great app. Easily backs up pics with little effort. Creating albums is easy and sharing groups of pics is convenient and easy. Archiving photos works well except when you try to send a photo. All off the archived photos can be seen with the rest of the photos. I don't know if that was intended but it's not expected. It could also be easier to create some animations or better collages on your own.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is a blessing. I change my devices quite often, and switch between my Phone, iPad, etc on a daily basis. The cloud save and simple UI of this app has helped me to keep all my photos and videos in one place and view them in a hassle-free manner. It also allows sharing with friends which is just icing on the cake. Highly recommended"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Photos has great automatic features and a clean UI. After uploading all of my photos to the cloud, it went ahead and deleted them all from my device. This would be totally fine, if not for the fact that I would have loved to keep them on that phone. (I must have missed the setting to disallow this) Now I have to go through and indivually press ""Download"" on each and every one (close to 1,000 pictures/videos) because there is no ""Download All"" button to retrieve them from the cloud to my phone."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app does the bare minimum of what you'd expect from something called ""photos."" You can save images, take screenshots, and so forth. If you're looking for organizing said photos, then this app is completely useless. If you so much as place images into folders they stop working and folders you deleted start popping right back up. Some images duplicate or are deleted. It is extremely buggy and frustrating to use, though for some this app is downloaded right from the moment you get the phone."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Slow, sluggish and unreliable. I prefer to use a 3rd-party app. It's often impossible to get new photos imported to it's database and that means that other apps can't access them at all. I would gladly get rid of this app as it does not add any value to my Android experience. Looks like it has to generate thumbnails for *every* photo *every* time another application wants to open them."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app with instant uploading to the cloud. Most of the website functionalities are also available in the app, which is great. One shortcoming, though, is that the software (on both the website and the app) is slow to recognize faces and you cannot manually tag a person as being present in a photo if the software did not detect a face."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like the idea that my photos are backed up to the cloud. Lose the phone? No problem, you have lost nothing if it is backed up to a cloud. Having said that, I have had photos that I add to albums Ive made get moved randomly to other albums. At one point it was happening so frequently that I could actually sit back and watch from the app page that shows albums and the pics would jump from album to album! Then whenever I was searching for a photo filed into an album I would no longer be able to locate it. And I have LOTS of pics so this turned into a labor intensive mission just to locate one damn pic that I had already filed away once. The only other annoyance that comes to mind is that damn ""would you like to archive this pic"" pop up......that gets on my damn nervessss....other than this it is an okay app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Photo management is complete chaos. Cant control where they go, how to move, how to keep in a private area, move or copy independently of all devices, how to access albums... then photos show up in multiple folders, and if you archive something, guess you have just deleted it. Easy photo mgmt software has existed for decades, this ain't it. Took a simple thing and complicated beyond belief. It's a nightmare. I'm pissed. You suck Google photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's okay, but there should really be an option to turn off syncing your camera folder. I take a lot of pictures but don't want hardly any of them backed up. I only want the pictures in my other folders backed up. Syncing my camera folder uses a lot of space and I ran out immediately. Until you can turn this option off this isn't a good choice for me. Looking for other options."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I kinda hate this app. Ok, it backs up your pictures. Other than that, one of the only features that distinguishes it from a simple gallery app is that it recognizes faces and lets you name them for later searches. But time after time it has simply tossed out entered names and faces, defeating the ability to locate those pictures in a search. More frustrating is the fact that it often won't let you add them back in. Also, when I try to copy some pics to other folders, it won't let me. Why??!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Good and bad things, but unfortunately they bad outweigh the good. Google is great at a lot of things. But photos is not one, now the features are good, such as pic to text and cropping capabilities. But the cloud aspect is frustrating. I can back up my pictures, but when they are backed up, and I want them back, stored on my phone, I have to download, every one of my pictures manually. Please make a ""download all pics to device"" button. And make the app less reliant on internet connection."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Ok, so still quite frequent updates, but starting to like the app functionally. For editing photos it is useful yet simple to use. Better than gallery. Still don't know why sometimes you can and sometimes you can't edit in 'photos', depending on location of the photo. I'm not a fan of gimmiky stuff, but the albums are pretty good feature."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is very clear and easy to use. I like the fact that you can add partner accounts, save not just photos, but videos too, restore photos or videos you accidentally move to the bin, restore videos from Photos into your device and possibly other devices. This is a great app to save and upload photos and videos online and I would recommend any other app. Keep up the great work and never stop making such great apps! ^_^"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is the most excellent photo app I've ever come across. There was this important documents that were mistakenly wiped out of my device storage, and once I tapped into this awesome app, though not all but a fraction of the documents could still be found. So I would like you add more functions to this app, like if you are not on WiFi or data network, this app should be able to collect all the images if not videos, so that when you're back online, it'll be able to back them up.! Good job üëç"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Amazing unlimited storage but it doesn't back up everything automatically. And I wish that whatever folder the pictures were in, they would still be in that folder when it's backed up because that's the point of having multiple folders in your devices, too keep them organized. It would be a big help in saving time and effort for not having to reorganize all that content again"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"There are 2 issues: 1) when you delete a photo permanently from trash sometimes it comes back 2) when you free up space some of the photos can still be found locally, somehow it fails to delete them; however, I noticed that they are saved in cloud... I hope at least... Other than that, the app works pretty well now. Much better than it used to."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"App is really good for the basic functionalities. Having the feature of putting photos in folders and being able to decide which ones get backed up or not is VERY useful for sorting and managing. Locked folder is a bless as well. However, I really don't understand why you can't keep the folders on the cloud storage. What's the porpouse of having multiple folders if it doesn't matter when they get backed up?? Also, not having a filter for device-only photos makes things hard sometimes."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It is reasonably useful for storing and organising images. There are some good editing tools that can enhance images, blurry backgrounds is a highlight. The facial recognition is terrible and inferior to every other I've tried. Each person in my gallery has been confused with multiple others. That happens occasionally with others, but with Google it's rendered it meaningless."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is simply amazing what this app can do. It is definitely the application that is leading in this area. In addition to what you would expect, the app will auto create albums, auto save contact from business card, automatically organize contact by different meta data. The thing that I was most surprised of was after a vacation I was notified that by the app that it had create a video of the whole trip. It had music and everything actually better than anything I could have put together."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Google Photos is a terrible app. I can never get the app to work. My biggest struggle is displaying my illustrations through the television using photos and Google home. This function sounds great... if only it worked. I always get stuck seeing a white spinny wheel of infinity or the album my photos are in cant display all the pictures. I've delved into the many quick fixes but this problem goes beyond it. Rating systems here should include negative stars. Thanks for wasting our time.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Photos has become my go to photo app. I like the free storage so I can get a new device, download the app and have access to all the photos again. Just be careful with back up if you have a limited data plan and set to back up on WiFi only. I like the built in features like animations and albums. So much more to it I cant even explain."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I am VERY pleased with Google Photos!! I luv how Google Photos make movies and stylizes the photos and how your able to customize the photos as well. It sure makes my day when i see a video of my son from the time he was little up until now or how they make a collage or a then and now frame. The music that's Added is a extra bonus! Another thing i like is how your Able to make you own video with your choice of several music options! keep up the great work a Google Photos!
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"An okay to get your photos backed up to Google, however it's bad at album management, you have to slide all the way through the ""photos on device"" through albums you're more than likely not using to go to the ""view all"" button. That's just a waste of time. I'd prefer when I pick album's tab for it to just show the album's I set up on my phone."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google photos is a fantastic program which functions well across both personal and professional photography roles. There's lots of easy editing options and RAW capable. Link sharing is an excellent way to distribute or share content with clients. The keyword search function is a huge time saver especially for those folks with extensive photo libraries. It's pretty universally compatible, I use it across phones, tablets, and laptops with no issues what do ever. I highly recommend Google photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really do love the amount of capability I get for the free version. The only things I don't like are that it freezes up when trying to get to old photos from over a year ago, and it's a little confusing knowing at which quality level my photos were added. I wish there were a warning when saving or backing up at low quality"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great and easy way to back-up your photos and videos. Also, the automatic creation.s, collages, videos etc etc are a great little touch. My only suggestion would be to make downloading and/or deleting uploaded photos easier. It's currently quite a long winded process, and I still haven't figured out how to delete large quantities of photos at once.... maybe people just buy more storage rather than try to delete things"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Been using this app for years mostly for the purpose of backing up my photos and it has worked seemlessly. Unfortunately do not at all understand the change in Your Map, it was one of my most used functions. Now you have to go to settings and look for photos with location to be able to see the map. Extremely unhappy, as the ""Places"" option groups photos rather arbitrarily and never shows everything I want in one place, so it takes extra unnecessary steps to access the map."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I rate this a 5 since this app is the best. Whenever i need storage i can just back up my photos here and just download them again. Not like before i always had a problem how ill delete my photos especially since i still need them. This is the perfect app for saving storage! You can save all your folders and have no problem downloading them back. Its a whole package!
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I generally approve of Google Photos, but lately the app is messing up. I have the ""rediscover the day"" feature turned off and yet I still wake up to those notifications. Not all of my pictures represent good memories, which is why I turned off the feature. And it's getting very old to see these notifications reminding me that it's an anniversary of a funeral or hospital stay. Not a great way to start my day. I'm uninstalling if possible."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Pretty good but lacks some very basic features. For example collage does not allow user to reorder/place photos ourselves, the same is true for animations. they can only be made from photos in the order they exist in the gallery, cannot reorder or even adjust photo framing, crop or resize. Creates animations from videos for you... but does not allow you to choose which videos animations are made from üòí"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing. I'm a model so I get super frustrated in my phone trying to separate professional Al photos, life photos, screenshots, etc. This app is so organized and efficient. The Google assistant is awesome. They give you suggestions, and a lot of them are very good. They can also turn your pictures into animation (short memes,) you can make them or like I said the assistant will guess what you need. I haven't taken a video but I'm sure the quality will be just as great."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Trouble moving files! I can no longer delete or move pictures from folder to folder from this app. It always tells me that it does not have access to my external memory device. There was no problem before the update. I have to go to files to delete/move photos. The app seemed to work well before, but it has now become nearly useless."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I collected a few pictures I had downloaded, and moved them into a new folder. All within this app of course. Several days later I notice the folder is just gone, disappeared, nowhere to be found, and neither are the pictures I downloaded. This happened several years ago, but I made the same mistake now, thinking that maybe they had fixed it, or maybe it was just an error on my part. Nope, this phone has deleted them yet again, despite me having had a factory reset somewhere in between."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It's fine for taking photos/video out of your phone but its really hard to get them back (I wanted to use some to make a movie on my laptop and had to find a way of making the clips save to my laptop so I could select and use them. It makes silly animations of your pictures all the time as well. Wish I could upload from Google to a file on my computer more easily. Otherwise it's OK enough that I will keep it rather than delete it.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I lost so many pictures hoping I see them again. I have about 100 pictures that turned gray. When I click on them they just load and load never ending. I have tried to reboot phone, force stop app, sign off and sign back in to account, reboot again and nothing. I have pictures of my grandpa's last days that meant so much to me before he passed away to Covid. Now it seems that the pictures are lost. I still have not delete them hoping one day they magically possibly reaper."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Back up and sharing are great. Unlimited cloud storage for hi quality images. This us probably the leading photo app. But the app is very basic - sorting tagging and labelling is practically non existent. You can't even do a slideshow with captions. This is very much a cloud based app with some offline capability. If you need to do something off line, then test it first. For example search does not work off line."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Updated review: the auto generated gifs are reintroduced along with photo collections. Still missing the video montages. Previous, 2 stars: Really really missing the auto-generated creation feed that was in a previous version of the app. Where it would make gifs and movies from my photos automatically. Loved it. It was the main reason I would come back and check in with Google photos. App still works, but very disappointed that this feature has been removed."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very appreciative of this app! I've been having the most difficult time transferring data and photos from my phone to my laptop. I've been restricted from taking more vidoes and photos due to the lack of space that I need. Google Photos obviously took notice and suggested that I move some of my items over that have been backed up them.. Thanks Google Photos!
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App has become unusable with latest update, constantly pops up with question that I'm not backing up which is selection I want. Selecting not to back up option just buffers indefinitely"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"i hate google photos! I like a simple gallery that allows me to view and organize photos the way I want. Google photos has so much going on and doesn't let me do what I want. i can either scroll through every single photo on my device all bunched up together, or view them from whatever location the app deccides to put them. What I really want is for all of my photos to go to a default folder, from which I can MOVE (not simply COPY) to an album (ON my device, not in a SHARED folder)"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app doesn't do anything. What's the point of having all of these edit functions and icons built into the app if you can't do anything with them? It won't edit photos, change lighting, draw or type on them, nothing. It just simply doesn't work. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, deleted the cache and data, logged out and back in, rebooted, etc. Nope, broken garbage."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Would be good if I could manually label photos the AI hasn't recognized. Like photos of people or pets that haven't been labeled. ""Unlimited"" storage is misleading, although it's still a great deal. You can only upload a limited amount of photos in their original quality, though I think the unlimited quality is plentifully high for most people."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been saving my pictures here for almost 6 years now. I'm so grateful for this app. When i lose a phone or switch phones, my photos are always there no matter what! This is the top BEST picture saver/sharing/editing app! You can also make collages, little short movies with all your pictures. Plus a lot of other options. I suggest this. Its completely free. Best of the best. I Couldn't say anything bad at all!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Hello, Please fix this photo app ASAP. There seems to be a glitch or virus. The instructions are repetitive and yet no action of new app is happening on my phone. Everytime I open my photos, it's on repeat, so I've had no choice but to download the app, that hasn't so far appeared to exist umpteen times. Otherwise, no complaints :)"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love being able to see all my photos and that they automatically upload/backup. Wish they would still sync with Google Drive. I just have to once a month manually download to my computer/Drive. Wish it was easier to sort the albums I create. Great editing options for cropping, fixing lighting, etc. Wish I could edit photo date/time & location from the app, but still can only do it from Chrome app either on my phone or laptop/desktop. That's what is preventing this app from earning it fifth-star."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Google photos has always been a wonderful gallery app to use but this latest UI change update is absolutely horrible. It's harder to navigate than before, confusing and some menus take more steps to navigate then the previous UI. Good UI design is one that allows the user to take the least number of options to the desired destination. It's absolutely horrid just because they wanted to remove the hamburger menu"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"In 2021 it no longer backs up the photos. It says it is backing up a thousand of my photos, but the number never changes. Not sure if anything is getting backed up. I have a note 10plus. This app started having this issue several months ago. It's always ""backing up"" but no progress is being made. I even upgradedy storage to 200gb today to see if that's the issue, but nope. Still saying it's backing up the same thousand photos it has been stuck on for months."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Most recent update has completely ruined my organization. Photos are being filed under the wrong dates. I have photos in the January section that when you pull up the details, it says that they were taken in February. Super frustrating. Edit: the Google team suggested I edit the date and time stamps. The date and time stamps are correct when you go to the individual images but in the organization they are wrong. This is not a me issue. It's an app issue. Extremely annoyed and frustrated"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It has worked great for me, but I just noticed a problem. When I turn off Backup and Sync, then turn it back on later, it changes my setting from High Quality to Original Quality (thus using up more storage space even though I've set it on High to use less) without my permission. Please address this, as it feels like a way to get users to use more space without their knowing it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I loved this app. It was smart, flexible and straightforward. The search functions were great and useful. But every update Google has applied to this app has made it dumber less intuitive, and more frustrating to use. The album sharing system has always been terrible, but most recently the side navigation window was removed and all your albums are now stuffed into a sensless 'library' section. Why move away from standard, utility oriented navigation to striped, unintuitive ones?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Forced updates bring more annoying wastes of screen real estate that add no value to anyone but Google. Edit: As I feared, more functionality was removed. Something I use every day. After the forced upgrade, the ""Create a link"" option is missing so I can no longer get a link to a photo or number of photos to paste into Messages. I have to send an MMS with the actual photos instead."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google photos is now my primary app for photo gallery. Couple of things factored for switching to google photos - 1. Auto photo backup. I don't have to worry about backing the photod to my hard drive anymore. It lets you recall deleted photos from recycle bin upto 30 days. 2. Google Lens - Just try it! I was amazed by this feature which scans your photo content and trys to identify the landmark in the photo. I used it to scan a photo of friend with hill and river inthe background. It correctly identified the location to some place in Canada. 3. Rediscover with Google - This feature wasn't that appealing earlier but the more google rediscovers my past photos timeline, it is helping me to recreate the memory which is the whole purpose of clicking a photo. Well thought! 4. Sharing Albums is so easy. I don't have to struggle sharing mutiple photos (more than 30) on my whts app. It helps you create a link which can be shared with friends &family who can even comment on your photos using this platform."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app, but it's lacking some basic functions and I can't understand why Google will not add them. Examples: sorting options (by filename, date added, date taken, size, etc). Album order (date, name, amount of photos, etc). The option to overwrite already backed up photos in good quality, with a version in original quality if you change the backup quality setting."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Poor interface. Very cluttered layout and poor aesthetics. Should adopt a more minimalist design, and make navigating the app a more streamlined process. Too many features (i.e. Archive, share, albums, folders.) The ability to move pictures between album and camera roll seamlessly as well as a multiselection picture function are to be expected in any decent photo app but is somehow lacking in this one."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It could show a folder or something like that with recently added pictures. Because the app automatically adds photos by the time they were taken. So, if you wanna find an specific recently added picture, it's impossible. Or you're gonna find one picture in one date and the other one in another. This could be improved. It's a search mechanism to be added."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I never think of saving photos from my phone, until my phone is a total loss. This app pops up seemingly at the best time and asks you to do so. And doesn't just save every photo, that would take me right out of decision. Just like this other PHONEI had it would save everything and have no space after a short time. Then you would have to buy a new one. But I'm sure that was the whole idea."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy the ease of use when editing pics (fix lighting, crop, rotate, etc), simple and quick to share pics/vids/gif's to many platforms (social media, Google drive, text/email). I'm not sure if the Assistant is all that clever, but I do enjoy the animations/albums it creates for me. The only thing I'm not sure about is that I persistently see copies of pics I have edited - if I edit a pic and save it, I would think that the app would go ahead and delete the (not so good) original pic."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app for backing up photos safely. NEEDS a lock photo and lock album feature that is password protected for extra security (for sentitive documents, etc), where previews of the album cannot be seen from the photos homepage. Archive is not secure enough especially since you cannot lock any albums. This would be a useful feature when letting someone you know borrow your phone. The search feature is quite useful in finding specific photos though."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"2 major problems that need to be fixed. 1. You can't download a bunch of photos at once and it's really annoying when you have to download over 100 photos one by one. 2. when I download photos onto a different device to make videos it messes up my photos and makes them broken. I then, after downloading over 100 photos, have to put every single one through another app one by one. Honestly, who has time to do all of that??? Especially when I'm gonna be taking over 500 screenshots for a video."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Recently google photos started to continually ask me ""Allow Photos to modify this Photo?"" It does this when I try to move, edit, or delete photos as well. Occasionally states that a photo was modified on another device and if I want to save it. I haven't even opened up photos on another device. Photos has all permissions. I am using a 5G phone with the latest updates as of 8-6-2021. This just started happening and it is getting in the way of me doing anything. It's become very frustrating!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Much like other Google products, this was an exciting app to use and recommend upon first release-- as a tech professional, it was a must-have for my clients. Fast forward to today, Photos is a shadow of it's former self. Crippling bugs, inconsistent and lazy UI, notoriously bad library management and bloated full of features. As that same professional, this app gives me more headaches than solutions, so I steer people away. Extra star for all the good years. Come back, Google. We miss you."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Easy to use and of course is always linked to your Gmail account and therefore the cloud. It's not perfect - not always easy to find something other than scrolling down looking for the day or month. The app does create albums all on its own but they don't often ""get it right"" with their choice of titles or photo inclusion. I guess a perfect AI isn't here just yet..."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Easy to use, links to Google account, has a decent amount of storage, automatically recommends which files are duplicates, blurry, or otherwise identified as appropriate for sending to the Bin or for the Archive to free up storage space. HOWEVER, by far my favourite feature is the Search function. It's SO helpful to get easy, fast, relevant & accurate results from years worth of pics. I also love how it's so easy to group pics together with the automatic suggestions using facial recognition."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app to store all of the photos and videos from my phone and tablet, so I can free up space and see everything all in one place. I really love the Google Lense feature, I use it all the time to look up products I buy or other things I want. I love that it will automatically make animations or collages you can keep or delete, and that it will let you know when you can safely free up space on your phone too! Also great when switching to a new phone, so I know nothing will get lost. :)"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"it's functional, but not convenient. It's bloatware on my phone, and I would remove it if I could. I download a different photo app that I actually use. What's wrong with this app? only one thing. Its default view is an organization that only makes sense to Google, certainly not to me. I like to access my photos in folders I designate, but Google won't let me open the app to my folders. Instead if I want to see my stuff my way, extra steps are needed."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Latest versions stable on my samsung. What I really hate is the amount of storage space, increasing permanently and significantly with every update. 862 Mb at the moment. That's just OMG! Just overhaul the app. Switch to extensions that can be added. If data storage continues increasing as in the past, I will just uninstall/disable whatever possible, rather than buying a new mobile after a year. That counts for a handful of other apps as well, just by the way."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If I could give it a lower rating I would. This is the most clunky, messy, non user friendly photo app ever. Let me give you an example. It won't let you organize your photos by anything other than the date it was taken. Unless you create an album which mean you now have photos in two places cluttering up everything. Putting them in an album does not remove them from the original picture folder. Just makes it a mess."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,In general I think the Google photos is a pretty amazing feature that no one thinks about or gives any credit to. I just wish there was a simple way to take all of my Google photos out of my Google photo storage and put it on my own personal computer hard drive. I also wish that Google support tech advisor was easier to reach and that the process to do this was easily explained in a YouTube video. Who knows maybe it is and I have not found it.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app has way too many categories. I would just like to be able to view my photos. And it's always trying to get me to do things and look at things. I just want the damn phone to be a tool rather than an advertising platform, I wouldn't recommend Moto g in general (that is the type of phone I'm using) and Google photos is just too busy for my taste. The edit features are fine. I do like the option to keep photos in a locked photo album."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Excellent way to back up, store, organize, and find photos. Only drawbacks: 1) I wish there were a way to only back up albums (not camera - so it doesn't save dumb photos you don't intend to keep) 2) The face recognition software often misses faces. I wish it would have an extra tool that has looser restrictions and allows the user to check YES this is a face and NO not a face 3) I also want a tool that runs through all unrecognized faces and tries to categorize them into existing albums"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Useful for backing up photos saving space on your device, especially if you don't have a device with large storage capacity. Nice features, only problem settings keep changing. There was a setting to prevent downloaded Google images from saviing to photos but it's no longer there. It was in ""files to choose/device folders"". It's not there anymore"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is very non-ergonomic! It's difficult and non-intuitive how to organize pictures. Google's own automatic classification is not useful! For instance there are ""pictures"" and there are ""photos"" ...why? Everything is Google business-oriented! The only facility I need is to organize pictures (from ANY sourse) into simple folders! That's it! All the other gimicks are confusing!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I personally love to organise photos and so have multiple albums. But some albums are more important than others. Thus, I feel these 2 features are absolutely necessary 1. Option to rearrange our albums. 2. Option to organise albums in other albums/ folders. In current way of organisation it gets quite confusing. 3. Also, can have a feature to state the type of album. Then have a filter option to display only particular types of albums at a time."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Like this app when I could sync Google Photos to my PC. Now I have to use google takeout. That is not a solution. Switched to Amazon Photos that supports this. I can also organize my photos in albums. As a bonus my photos are displayed on my FireTV as a screen saver. This is exactly what my wife wanted. Too bad Google can't connect their devices and services together for a nice user experience.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,There is a bug in the dates for the device folders. The dates are all wrong and it shows photos taken at a later date as if they are from an earlier date. For example photos taken in September 2018 appear under May 2018. And photos taken in February 2019 appear like they are taken in January 2019. This issue makes it difficult for me to organize my photos and delete photos in bulk by selecting the date! I noticed this bug many months ago but only reporting it now. PLEASE fix this issue soon!!!
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app does not work well. I have a Pixel 2 smart phone which is supposed to automatically load my phone photos on to Google Cloud Photos. Did fine for the first year, but now fails to load photos any more and I can't find out why it doesn't work any more. This app is still supposedly loaded, just not working! Another complaint is picture quality. Resolution is not as good as it should be and not as good as the phone camera is capable of taking.. I am guessing the app compresses photos to transmit them loosing image quality. ?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Despite updates virtually every week (?!) this app is horrible to use. It's a mess and so difficult to navigate. Folders and albums everywhere with some unaccessible when you try to post a photo from different apps so you have to move photos from one folder to another just so you can use that photo. The collages are a waste of time, day you choose to use two photos for some reason you can't choose which photo goes top. I wish i didn't have to use this mess of an app."

You're better off printing your memories rather than trying to save them on this app. Don't trust this app with your precious memories. I lost mine of my son's last game. I will change my review if google can retrieve my photos.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Google photos feels like a part of the family. Reliable and always there. It's super convenient and honestly helps me save so much space on my phone. It's always a pleasure looking back and having that backup if anything goes wrong. I've been with google a long time now and since have no complaints. I highly recommend getting on board.üëè
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is difficult to navigate.. the layout changes on it's own. Are are my pictures on the internet if I backup with the cloud? Google lense is cool, I'll give them that. Also, I would like to again point out that the layout change sucks. It goes from the order of viewing my photos by month, by folder, by place or by similar objects. What happened to motion/animated pictures? I loved those but can't seem to get that part of the app to function."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this app!! The assistant is wonderful as well. I never have to worry about losing my photos or videos with the automatic back up and free up space features either. In short this app makes EVERYTHING to do with taking, sharing, creating, storing, and deleting photos and videos easy and enjoyable!! üëç"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This opinion may be aimed moreso at the Android os than the photo app. I would prefer that when I take a picture and the save it,the picture would be in only one location unless directed to do so otherwise. I hate it that my storage gets cluttered with multiple versions of the same photo as if Everytime ive opened,edited or sent a picture with a different app, it's as if there's another copy saved. This is only speculation on my behalf. I find it quite annoying and dumb imo."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been deleting a lots and lots of photos in the app and emptying trash on Google Photos and One Drive, and STILL the storage has the same FULL quantity... ü§® Great features, but a LOT of TROUBLE NOT getting storage full (in my opinion, it's like it's made to be extremely difficult). I could have more free storage space, and not been able to. I'm not happy about this. Update: Still having the same issue... üò´"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Updates change the saving of photos, creating copies of photos I just want to replace with my edits. Moving folders from one folder to another takes forever and usually doesn't work. Often I can't even edit my photos. It also has problems editing photos that are moved from different folders. Also, sometimes when I move photos from one folder to my main folder, it doesn't even show up in all my photos. Finally, the SD card permissions make me download a different app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is pretty great and 100% secure. It's a little bit tricky to use and follow the structure of where your pictures and albums get put, but once you get the hang of it, it's great to have. You never have to worry about if your pictures are gonna get deleted or anything because they're always safe here. I recommend deleting most of your photos from your gallery once you have this app, for storage reasons, but don't worry, your photos and albums are DEFINITELY safe with this app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app, like all google products, lack the complexity in functionality. It's impossible to know what you've added to an album and what you haven't. Without some kind of indication of what's already in an album it's just too time consuming to organize photos. I'd also like a second way to add hastag or keywords to photos so you have a secondary way to sort/search photos in an album."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have been using this app for years and always loved it, but this recent update sucks! Why would the developer remove so many of the editing options? The only ones that seem to work properly are the Warm, Cool and Enhance... And they're horrible! Crop still works as well thank goodness, but the other filters, etc either don't work or are very delayed. Not to mention, my pictures aren't syncing from other devices. I can't stress how horrible this app is now! I'm going to search for other options"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Has become extremely slow since a few weeks. Photos once snapped take ages to appear on the app. Basic tasks like rotating photos practically paralyzes the app. It just hangs and all changes are lost. It has become almost unusable. It's almost like Google is acting like Apple and slowing the phones down on purpose, so that you want to replace your phone."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It doesn't have a natural interface and the clean up option tries to archive most document photos saying they are clutter. I don't like the 2 way sync feature so if you delete an image in either then it's not long before it's gone on device or google photos, there does not seem any way to control this. I do like the timely reminders as they spark conversations, you know, when people used to talk ü§îüòâ."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's a good one. I liked it so much. Specially the edition system attracts me very much. We can see our images easily here. The features of this app is too good. It's actually a system app on android phones. But it's one of the most useful one. But there's a bit problem here. That is sometime's they show a fake date of photo. I think an update can fix it.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"a very intuitive app, you can edit your photos or it can do it for you, offcourse the photo backup option is great, and the other best thing is it works on your laptop as well, you can just drag any photo you want to add to your album and drop it here. The only issue I have is that creating and managing folders is a bit complicated for me."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"God if this App only had the ability to arrange albums into alphabetical order it would be the best photo album and organizer on the planet. Visually it's the most modern and fresh looking organiser on the market and sycronizing with other tablets and pc is amazing but LACKS the most basic functions. So sad especially from somebody as good as Google . Having seen hundred of requests since the above review was written and google doing absolutely NOTHING ""Yes that's Right NOTHING"" About sorting the App to allow people to sort Albums Alphabetical one would assume google neither has the time or capability to sort or care about its customers."

Lighten shadows and highlights separately as well as adjust exposure, ect. LOVE the assistant and the auto-generated albums, gifs, and stylized images. Wish it had a teeth whitening tool, other than that i think it has all the basic tools needed for quick editing without having to download extra editing apps."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Nice app... would be even nicer with these features (Thus only 3-Stars) - 1. Ability to rename pictures. 2.

The app needs (currently completely lacks) the ability to bring back (un-upload; make them only local again and delete uploaded copies) the pictures synced to Google Photos (cloud)."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app works well but it can be very unreliable when searching for photos. For example, I will type in 'cat' and images of dogs will appear in my gallery. It can be inaccurate and I wish to see more accurate results when searching specifics, such as coloured objects, specific foods etc. Otherwise it's very easy to use and all round perfect for someone with tonnes of images."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The greatest photo app in my opinion. I really wish you remove the ((+ new album)) option from library.. or place it at the bottom of the library as it really hinders the visually immersive experience. There is no need for that option in library at all as clicking it doesn't let you add photos from folders. You have to manually go inside folders to add pics into it, which I don't mind as the app is smooth and pleasent and it is easy to find photos & move them around. Lens & othr features run gr8"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If I could give it zero stars, I would. It didn't used to be this bad. I've been trying to free up space and didn't know deleting photos from the app storage also deletes them from the phone! When given the option to let the app clean up, it told me it was safe because they'd been backed up....but it removed nearly all my family pics from the albums I had made on my phone ! I think it ""saved"" them in the app, but at a lower quality, and, now, I have to go hunting for them!!!!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like Google photos a lot. It has a very user friendly interface to work from , with an outstanding number of settings to deal primarily with the organization of photo files, and the creation of many variations of albums and movies, fully editable!. It's compatible with many types of photo files(even some RAW). For organizing your photos, if you're a Google user, then you definitely want this app to manage, create, and edit YOUR photos. üòâ"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I guess photos more useful than the Google drive, because I tested to transfer videos to the cloud, and the Google drive is horrible to transfer many multimedia files, already the Google photos no, it's a good app, 'cause saves quickly anything that's multimedia files and have not problems to transfer big files or with big amounts. Unfortunately, I lost some videos, 'cause I don't activate the backup, and could activate when I install photos, 'cause after it almost staies always activated"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is hands down the best photo app out there. The ability to share original quality photos quickly and easily with family and friends is very underrated. I can share 60 pictures taken during a family event with everyone and let them choose which pictures to save just by sending a link. The Google Assistant automatically creates albums, stylized pictures, collages, gifs, and videos! I've been pleasantly surprised with many of the created items. It even backs up pictures on your phone!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really love this app. It gives me the opportunity to have all my photos in one place where I can access them over multiple devices, which is a BIG help for me. I can ever free up a little space in my devices by uploading all my photos to this app & clearing my gallery. I really like the editing features, it's easy to crop/rotate photos. It would be nice to have the option to edit photos with more fun stickers & images but no biggie. I highly recommend this app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have really liked the app, so far! The auto-animations, collages, and filters are generally pretty good. And honestly, I wouldn't end up making them myself... So for Google to make them for me is great. Collecting images by face is great, too. Even for pets! I just wish I was better at getting old photos included in the app so it could go through those as well."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really good app specially with AI grouping of photos by place, person, etc.. however, i am unable to edit in some of the videos and people who appears in the video or misrecognized by AI, Unlike the photos but with photos""still images"" the i would have to keep changing/editing if the AI keeps missing between looking similar people. Over all great app and has great potential. But there is always room for improvement. With new technologies and integration."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great photo app! Lets you delete photos while still having them backed up online and will automatically put special effect on photos that will look great with effects using special formulas (I have a Pixel, and the pictures look amazing, especially ones of nature). There are also albums, shared albums, and plently of free space for people without a Google phone. Pictures neatly organized, and the app will make albums for you (like a screenshot album). Will record location, which is helpful."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app. But when I use my Android phone and try to create a new album, it's not asking to select any collection from phone. It will display all the pics. So it's very difficult to search what to be added in album. This does not happen when using laptop/desktop. I can find the folder where photos are kept. Can somebody please assist on this."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app. Best for backups and instant access from other devices. Great features. Devs! I know this is probably not a big priority for you, but please fix the new Samsung Motion Photos backup on One UI 2.5. It has stopped backing up motion photos, it's just stills now. We would really be impressed if this is done soon, alot of people depend on it, I spoke to other people and they all have the issue. Thanks for all the work"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love all the features... So much easier to create gifs, and animations.... Also makes it super easy to share across other forms of media, such as Google drive, Facebook, or simply add to a regular text or messenger... And it changes the pics and videos to formats that are allowed to be sent from the original.... The storage space is extensive in the cloud and allows me to clear up a lot of space on my phone... It sucks being charged for storage over a certain amount of GB or MB, but that's all"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's wonderful. Gets better every time I use it. Auto backups and all my pictures in one place do no matter if I'm at Walmart or Shutterfly I can easily access my pics. Thanks a lot. Well unlimited storage was nice while it lasted. Going to have a hard time keeping under my limit if they don't find a way to delete whole groups of email at one time. Still I love Google Photos best out of all the ones I've tried.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Since the last update it crashes as soon as it opens every time. Had to uninstall and reinstall which worked great, until it again suggested I update to experience the latest features. Updated and same problem as before. Pixel 6pro. Please fix as currently unusable. Update: generic fixes for any app that you suggest are no use whatsoever. And the email address below to contact developer are no longer monitored as I received an email back alerting me to. So basically no way of contacting you."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app works well enough but suffers the same perpetual beta and boundary problems as many others by Google. What I mean by this is that features come and go constantly without warning as well as interacting with other imaging apps and OS features in ways that are unpredictable. For example, the Backup & Sync feature was uploading screenshots BEFORE I had responded to a notification asking if I wanted to do this. The addition of tutorials to explain features and changes would help a lot."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I just need to take a whole day off, and feed my whole digital-self along with my sLR-gear into this app. What a beautiful and elegant design. Simplicity at its best. And then, adding the assistant is like, cherry on top. üòÅüòô If you're into photography, basic editing, sharing, organizing, collaborating, and most importantly... storing all your work in one place, then THIS IS IT! Ordering 'Photo-books' via the app is as easy as 1,2,3. The app also releases updates for older phones."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love how the app automatically creates animations and videos with my pictures. I love how it organizes my pics, and you can select someones face, and it will show you all the pics of that person in your albums. O also love how it brings of photos for you to rediscover from back on the day!! I just absolutely LOVE this app!! Nothing bad to say whatsoever!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Can't download the update and it doesn't sync my photos from my phone. Thank you for the Very prompt answer and help with this. I wasn't expecting that from such a large corporation. Overall Google Drive and syncing etc works super well and is incredibly helpful. I think also the issue with the photos not syncing was due to lack of storage space on my phone. It worked when I cleared it, ironically after a prompt from Google to remove items that were already backed up to the cloud."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Usually, an awesome app. The thing is that Google Photos (the product/service) is having major issues with face recognition-- it just stopped working. There's plenty of online support threads about the issue, hundreds, if not thousands of reports and complaints, but Google doesn't seem to acknowledge that publicly and/or take care of it. Bummer. #photoshelp"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is great as you can backup photos very easily and sometimes it stylises photos automatically, although you can also do it manually, you can share & edit photos much simpler and faster now. It can create albums for you, it identifies images and names from inside the images, something unique for me. This app is not always easy to use, u'll take some time to get used to it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"No longer unlimited and has trouble following my instructions. I only wanted to sync camera, not random folders, so I made sure to uncheck the folders in settings. Photos followed my desires for most folders, but ignored my settings for screenshots folders, so it kept saving random things. Deleting them from photos forces deletion from phone too, so that's unacceptable. Also, when I changed setting to not sync device, it just kept syncing. Final nail in the coffin was becoming not unlimited."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This update is the absolute worst. No longer are the folders small, easy to navigate single pics, but now the first dozen photos from each folder, filling the entire screen, with a tiny label... I can't just tap a pic to open the folder, now I have to scroll through pages to find the folder I'm looking for - plus, other than ""camera,"" everytime I open ""Photos,"" the folders are going n random order - and there's no way to alter or customize the view. Thanks for making garbage! üëç"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Useful for saving, organizing, and sharing digital or scanned/digitized pictures. I chose the unlimited storage option which uploads pictures in a slightly lower resolution, but which can still be printed in large format. One glaringly obvious missing feature is the ability to indicate who a person or pet in a photo is. This would help organize photos and should also help the AI better recognize people and pets in other pictures."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is the best place I've found for keeping photos. I like all the extras. For example. Google just went through my photos and found 6 that were upside down or sideways. It displayed them for me and by one tap I was able to straighten each one out. It (Google) did ask permission first. Pretty cool. I also have had photo books made and they are really nice.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is the best photo app I have ever used. I bought more space, 200GB for HD quality photos and videos, and I am so surprised at how inexpensive it is compared others! You have the option of unlimited free storage but I use mine for my online profile so I chose to pay extra. From the app you can choose which albums to backup, it let's you know when some pics need to be rotated, you can even free up space on your phone by tapping a button and letting it delete originals once backed up safely!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like Google Photos except for 1. New past updates eliminated some editing features 2. This is my biggest complaint and always has been. When I create an album and move pictures to it the pictures stay in photos and the album. I don't want or need the pics in both places. Since deleting either place it deletes both places. Please fix this. Again, I don't want the same picture in two places, they are already backed up and in the cloud. Also editing changes original date to edit date."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The quality of this app has reduced considerably. I am not able to create links for shared folders. I cannot delete shared folders. If I want to open any new shared folder, it takes forever to load photos & videos (& no internet speed is not an issue. I checked that multiple ways). The app has started duplicating my photos and videos. Even if the duplicated items don't take up extra space, i don't want to see duplicated items on my app. The duplicated videos don't play. End of word limit :("
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's good in many aspects like it backup the photographs and also sync them across devices which really useful when I don't have the exact device I took the photographs on...but the flaws are annoying as on the older version of Google Photos, it is really slow while loading pictures andvideos as well as it does not show the filtered effect well while editing the picture on the application...it gets irritating sometimes but since I haven't used the newer version of it, I can't say anything...let's see..."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"You can do some really cool things with your pics with this app. I actually really love the suggestions they throw out at you periodically. They suggest fun animations and collages. They create books that you can edit and buy. I never would have thought to do that, and of course, I have to edit some pics to get these books just the way I want them, but it's cool that they suggest it and throw out ideas. Also, I like the ""remember when,"" where they show you pics from years ago. Great to reminisce"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very useful app. It has many file options to choose, or keep it as a single group. It took some time, but I am using a few choices now as I needed to separate into simple groupings. The storage has several options as well. The free option is unlimited, good quality, and Very acceptable. Access work flawlessly across multiple devices and my accounts for input, view, and share Thanks!!!!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I took three photos today. Google Photos delayed uploading them because it needed to ""process"" them first. It said it was ""preparing to upload"" my photos. It was stuck in this state for about four hours during which I could not even share the photos because they were still being processed. Then, only to be able to access and share these photos, I decided to reboot my phone. When it finished rebooting, the photos were gone. Google Photos deleted my pictures and I feel betrayed."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I don't find this very user friendly. It's confusing and difficult to organize my photos and it's got very limited options. I used to have a Huawei and I really liked the way the gallery worked on that phone. iPhone is also more user friendly than this. I wanna be able to have a list of albums and decide what order etc but everything backed onto the cloud always shows and it's just a ball ache
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have recently viewed a video that I saved in Google photos n the quality was worse than I expected. This is one of the videos I recently uploaded. Its the 1st time I noticed it. Becuz the videos I saved before look good. Really disappointing especially since I deleted the original video frm the phone. Idk what happened. I think the recent photos don't look as clear as the ones I saved before either. I changed setting frm ""high quality"" to ""original quality"" but I don't trust the app anymore."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's hard to find a more fluid, well-integrated storage tool for media content than Google Photos. It's just so easy to back things up and then access them elsewhere, and I enjoy how the app seeks out faces to group things together and even suggests things like rotating images and freeing up space from your device. My biggest complaints are Photos severing ties with Google Drive, and more importantly; the inability to do simple organizational functions like RENAME A FILE WITHIN THE APP."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Not content at all using this photo viewing application as by default it would perform file synchronization to any assigned Google account(s). By default the application should've had the sync feature turned off. The other thing: the newer application version actually slows down phone performance esp. on older phone models. On the Samsung Note 4 for example, updating this application would delay the phone bootup process, and shows the ""Android is starting/Optimizing app 1 of 1"" screen. Sticking to the older version would resolve this issue. I don't share image data let alone storing anything personal online. The GP may be an OK image browser application, but that's it. Any added features would not only slow down phone performance but may actually harm the original image data (such as image optimization by down-sampling, recompression etc.). But since I cannot uninstall/delete the application (as part of the Android system component) I'll just leave it alone to rot."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ever since the last update, every single app I use on my phone that allows me to send or upload photos (including texting and emailing) crashes whenever I open the option to select a photo. I've been waiting for a fix and yet it hasn't come yet. I tried restarting my phone multiple times, clearing the cache on every since app, and yet nothing. What is happening?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Unbearable. I can't move images from one folder to another because it kept saying ""trouble moving items"" and some images just turned all dark as if they got damaged or something?? Like WTH?? Edit: Alright this app is ridiculous. I moved some photos to a new folder a while ago, and today when I checked the entire folder was wiped out! All the photos were gone! I can assure you I've never had issues with photos with my Samsung phone for the past 6 years. Extremely disappointed with google pixel."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have finally learned how to make albums. It's great that I'm able to take photos and crop and alter them, and THEN save them! It's even better that I can take my phone to the drug store, and copy any picture I've wanted! Folks can use different programs to get the effects that they want, for their own types of work, BUT, I find Google Photos. It's easy to use and navigate, and pretty much explanatory. Thank you, Google, once again!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app for years! It is by far the easiest way to share photos among groups of friends, co-workers, or families, and the ways it integrates with Google Home products are making it more useful by the day. Perhaps the best thing about the app after the amazing automatic creations the Photos Assistant churns out after big picture taking days. The .gifs in particular always impress me, and I get accolades from friends and family for the special memories. Lo & behold, it was Google!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. It saves all of my photos, they are easy to share, and they are organized by date or person. I also enjoy when the assistant makes movies and other things with my photos. The only down side is I can't upload the photos to any other app that will let me make prints of my photos. The .25 option on the app is too expensive. Other places you can get 4x6 for only .09."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Backup options are not sufficient. There should be an option to enter Auto Backup From & To time in the settings. This would allow the app to backup photos using data or wifi at a specified time everyday. For eg. Backup between 2230 to 0000 hours. The app takes up a lot of storage and data, so it takes time to download & share photos. If you cannot increase the storage limit, at least provide an option to add more email ids to backup photos. The app badly needs an upgrade."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app has helped me to choose photos that are blurry and out of sync with my devices and that I have duplicates or multiples of that I do not need. It also helps me to utilize features like changing the light effects and making the picture brighter and easier to view. I would like to try the option of creating a GIF which does seem to be an option. The Google 1 storage is also a great value for storage of photos from Google.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"No privacy! I love Google but this app is not conducive to privacy. You can ""archive"" photos so they are out of your main feed but other than that there is no easy way to hide photos from your main album. There is also no way to seperate your photos unless you make a separate album for everything, everything ends up on the main stream and without the ability to hide photos, its worthless for privacy. The nicest part about this app is that you can obtain them across all of your devices."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Unbelievable. I clicked on Back up files to the cloud to save you space on device and been searching for weeks for the files. Still don't know where they are. Many of these files were being used by an app for a presentation I had been working on for at least a year. It completely ruined it. I fell into severe depression as a result. I had to use a video that I uploaded to you tube but far sub par. Google is screwing around. They need to warn people beforehand. There was no warning.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new UX is absolutely terrible. This was such an intuitive app before these latest changes. Sincerely, as an Android Developer and Engineering Manager, you need to roll back. I literally can not find half of the things I want to get to. Finding albums shared with me took me 10-15 minutes of digging through every screen to come up with nothing, and then finally notice there is a conversations button in the top left corner of the app bar where shared stuff lives. Like what?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Google photos is awesome! It has literally been saving my memories for me throughout the last 2 decades almost automatically each time I take a picture of something per each phone I have ever owned during that time frame. Honestly I don't know what I would have done without the Google photos app. I guess I would have had to suffer any time I simply lost or had stolen from me one of my many phones.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google Photo is great for storing and sharing photos with some very rudimentary editing features (that I'd love to see expanded someday). But, it is perfect for what it does. Keeping your photos flawlessly safe and always there from one Android device to the next and for that peace of mind it is invaluable. The included storage lasts a very long time for me (at original resolution at that) and additional storage plans are well priced."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Actually THE BEST photo app. I just got the Google Pixel 3 XL and the photo assistant is awesome for people like myself, the not-so-tech-savy! I love to take pictures of our family's lives, however don't particularly have the time (nor attention span) to sit at a computer to edit and stylize. This app provides me the ability to have ready-made photo albums (with audio!), stylized photos and all conveniently located in the same app. Very cool üëçüèºüëçüèº"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"does ""photos"" take photos or store/edit them? the camera takes good photos. The photos app stores them well (but it can be a little counterintuitive finding photos). what more can i say? whichever one it is, the editing tools are standard and a bit limited. i have no idea if i can buy more tools, but I have no intention of spending money on something that should be included."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I wish when you go through your photos and place them to the different albums that that's the only place you would see them. It's impossible to sort all of my pics because I don't know where I left off. I'll have to start over again and again. It's too much work.... Other than that, its got pretty good features like facial recognition and putting each person in their own album etc. I will try to update after I see how this current update works. I need to spend every minute sorting all of my pic"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's mind blowing to me how well the search function works, type in a word of something in one of the pictures, and *ding*, it'll find it. Organizing the pics is easy, sharing them is even easier. I have access to them anywhere from computer, phone, and tablet. Sort by date, sort by location... Tell it who the various people are and it will recognize them. Plus, let it save hires versions and not the full native resolution, and space is free and (so far) without limit."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Love Google Photos, I mean who doesn't? Great app with lots of functions, and it's relatively easy to use. Only complaint is the upcoming storage issue. I personally believe Google makes enough money to store our pics for free, even if one person uses 500T of storage. Google stop being cheap! Only 3 stars until you change the upcoming picture storage problem."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Worst photo app I have ever used (after several years of several phones/brands). It literally takes hours to find a few photos for printing because the subfolder function is so useless. Folder view is cluttery, self-made folders don't show up in selection lists or other apps, organization is incredibly difficult. Absolutely awful. Tied in with the rest of pixel's provlems, I can't wait to have a different phone."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They make it nearly impossible to download your photos to your device. With all the features they have, they couldn't add a ""select all"" button and a ""download""?? This app will continue adding photos even after you disable automatic backup. And deleting the photo from the app will FORCE you to also delete it from your phone. This app is like an obsessed ex"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Cant see entire sub menu anymore without having to scroll. Also, my folders on my device have been automatically deleted by Google Photos, making it difficult to find photos to submit in other apps. I had to spend over an hour to find and recreate all of my folders on my device because other apps won't allow me to find and upload photos from Google Albums."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Overall, good. But, the option of ""free up space"" simply deletes everything on the phone without options to review or select first. Does not even ask for reconfirmation before doing the action. One click and all the one backed up to the cloud gone from your device. Plus, all the backup photos are simply back up to one single place (and sorted by date) instead of within folders like your device usually has. Since I prefer looking into the folders as the pictures I saved are for specific purposes."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It'd be great if it didn't remove photos from my device for no discernable reason, to only be accessible from the (thankfully) in-app cloud storage. I have no idea how it's decided which photos go, but you don't get to choose and there's no way to undo en masse. You'd have to go through each individual photo to see where it's stored, and download it again. Ridiculous. I didn't download photos so I could be denied them when outside of wifi. Very frustrating ""feature""."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I am frustrated to find the photos I delete in Photos, which has superior photo processing apps, don't seem to be deleted in Gallery when I go there to make albums. I'd prefer to do all my album work in Photos, so I wouldn't have to change apps for that, but I haven't found Photos inviting for that. Gallery seems written for album making. So now I'm stuck with having to make all those careful decisions about deletions twice. HELP!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've personally never had ANY problems w/ it! I LUV it actually!!! It's so easy to navigate through, and it's nice to go back when i have free time, and j just look up old photos, and the collages, and slide shows that they automatically make for you is pretty awesome too, especially cause you get to decide if you want to keep them or not."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Garbage update. Does anyone know how to revert to the previous version? You take photos. Some may appear others take on hour or more to appear on your roll. When taking photos with your phone is a part of your business/job, the ability to access photos with the *correct* time stamp and correct order taken is critical. I'm spending crucial time waiting for all the photos to appear and then uploading in the correct order. Who has time for that?! Looking for another app option. Open to suggestions."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Why can't i make an album that takes my photos from the camera and saves them? If i save photos to an album they still appear on my camera reel. This makes it difficult to navigate the app. Im an old school guy that wants to make albums with pertinent pictures associated to it. If i delete a photo off my camera reel than it should still exist on my albums. The last two updates to the app have been senseless. Theres no added value to them. The older version was much more user friendly.

Whether broken, stolen, ruined from sand or down the river... This has photos from all the phones in all those years in one spot. Thanks"

The only issue I ve here which I would be very happy if Im helped out, is this.... normally after the app has backed up your photos from galery, it tells you to delete the photos on the device, after deleting, I observe that some photos on the app are no longer opening as a result of the ones that were deleted. pls can I know why this issue."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Takes a bit of learning, but quite useful once you find out what ""Archiving"" is. You may need to peruse and read the help topics more than you want, but the automatic labeling with or w/o the location of the pic (quite a lot of settings) and sorting methods are actually very convenient. Very good quality pic/vid viewing and useful tools. ***(+) 3.5 of 5 for the many--yet vaguely defined--options and the awkward layout of the menu tabs/tools."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I recently updated my phone and to my horror they completely changed Google photos to this new god-awful version. I primarily use the app to edit photos for my eBay listings and what they have done is a complete overhaul . It's difficult to navigate there is no auto adjust and the end result is the photos don't look as good because I can't manually adjust them easily. I'm trying to download the previous version but I'm finding it difficult. I will never ever update my phone
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love to use Google Photos. The ""Assistant"" creates awesome movies, albums, stylized photos on its own. The app adds background music automatically to the video and we can even edit the video (remove any photo video that are not needed, or change the time for a particular photo). The editing features are also good, however I have edited only photos with this app. Not sure about video editing. One thing I miss in the app is the ability to quickly tag photos and videos so that searching is easy."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Personally downloaded it for the back up feature which I think should be brought to Gallery Go. My issue is that folders in the app should be given the option to arrange them via: 1. Alphabetically 2. Date modified.....just like Gallery Go. It is VERY difficult searching for pictures amongst tens/hundreds of picture folders like me. I don't need to add them to an album for a good arrangement. Secondly, when I select a photo to TRASH, it keeps prompting me to allow photos move to trash. Fix üôè"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Not intuitive at all, I have an easy time using technology but the system for photos/albums is difficult. I wish there was just a general camera roll where ALL photos/videos went INCLUDING screen shots. I've tried ""editing with markup"" on screen shot images, but once I hit save the image I'm on reverts to original and the save image presumably ends up elsewhere? The auto albums would be much better as an option rather than a default, guessing which album a photo has been placed in is tedious."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a very good photo app. Easy sharing, easy editing, suggestions. Simply, the best. One thing though and maybe I missed something, but used to be able to add a text title at beginning of a movie creation but can't anymore, actually it's been awhile since it could be done. Could that be corrected, so text for title in a movie creation can be included in the created movie?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"None of my created movies will save as vids. I click the save button after editing, and while it takes me out of the editor, it doesn't turn my ""movie"" into a video. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app, and tried saving in various ways and various places. Nothing works. A quick search shows that this is apparently not an uncommon issue, at least on the Pixel 7, and it's also apparently not one that's been resolved. Frustrating, to say the least."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app. It's very good when it comes to back up storage plus the fact that all items are organize according to date. It's just that when I move the picture to another folder it back ups again turning out have a duplicate photo in my back up storage but it's not a big deal I have that habit of always creating another folder. All in all this app is really great. Thank you so much!
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"very unpleasant to use app. after editing a video at all (crop, mute, anything), the new copy is pixelated and blurry at some points when the original video was not. google is the third largest tech company in the world, how do they get away with releasing unfinished garbage like this? // the UI gets completely redesigned (and significantly worse) every other update, it seems. design a UI that works well, then stick with it forever; i shouldn't have to relearn how to use this app every month."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Good! I'm looking on my hand spelling out words that I can send through the air by basically pushing a button that isn't there! Or shouldn't exist!?? 'Optimize the thing that shouldn't exist'(Musk,E. 2021) Add to that, I'm publishing a review from my bedroom that anyone that's interested can read, there's too many realizations to list my heads spinning. Great job on ""Google Photos"". Adds always suck! But till we come up with ways besides money to basically do everything with, less is best"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a great app for backing up and storing photos, videos etc. It also automatically allows for a string of similar photos to be transformered into a great panoramic photo!! The only thing that worries me is the privacy issues. It is my fear that one day, somehow one of my more private photos, somehow gets uploaded to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. This would be an absolute nightmare for this to happen, and would hope google would never allow it to happen. Besides that, it's great!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Overall a good basic app which you can rely on if all you want is back up your photos on the go. Following features are needed for long time:‚óèOption to choose folders that are system inbuilt i.e. dcim, screenshots etc. Backing up screenshots is just foolish.‚óèAlso device change should be noted, it sorts everything according to dates. But this should be done inside a specific folder, I know drive option is there, but you have to do it manually in case of drive."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A beautiful development by Google here to save your pictures and it works well and saves space in my mobile. With brilliant features like ""search"" to look for a particular type of picture or theme. Suggestions, and automatic selection, create and share albums with family and friends. Reminds you of memories and you can always download the pictures and videos anytime."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's pretty cool. although sometimes it takes a while for a screenshoted pic or received pic or video to show up in the google photos. please fix that. also when trimming a video, google photos tend to increase the video size a lot. for instance a video is 5mb, after trimming with google photos the trimmed copy will be like 15-19mb. please work on that and improve app. I'll definitely rate it 5 stars then. keep up the good work!!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I do like the app. However, it doesn't give you nearly enough free storage. It also costs a wee to much for more. I had 97% full.. went through and deleted all the random screenshots and videos I had downloaded. Now I have 44% full and it's still telling me I'm ""almost full"" that it's ""time to buy more storage"" 97 to 44 and its almost full? Makes no sense guys!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love the photos app a lot, just a couple critiques: 1. its hard to fully edit photos in the app itself and requires third party apps to fully edit some things 2. you cannot easily access all of your photos offline. otherwise, i love the app. Everything is organized and auto backs up. I also love the auto edits it makes of your photos and videos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"App is functionally good. Some problems with video uploads never being ""ready"". Newest update absolutely ruined the timeline, which was previously one of my favourite features. Instead of 1/2/3/4/etc years ago on this day, it's a mess of ""remember this"" and useless albums. Additionally, the decision to animate every image is horrible. Just...why? It's a photo app. Now instead of reliving my nice photos I have a terrible nausea inducing look at a moving cropped photo. Please please remove this"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Unintuitive. its fine if you want to save space and put everything on the cloud but as someone who bought a phone with more space to keep more photos on it its not necessary. accidentally pressed save space and there was no way to stop the process, Can stillview on the app but must use internet. i do not want this. now i have to wait 6 months until i can afford a computer to download and save back on my phone."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The viewing experience is great. Everything else is unreliable and full of bugs. The app leaks storage, and has become nearly unusable on a 32 GB Pixel. Editing randomly hangs. Opening and emptying the trash takes ages. Face recognition is a hit and miss. Editing photo descriptions is annoying, because the keyboard overlaps with the text box. The album view lacks essential controls, like a trash button."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I absolutey hate the new setup!!! The photo assistant used to be amazing! Now, it's basically obsolete! Why would you take that tab away, buy continue to have the assistant! The whole daily slideshow thing????? Also, very cumbersome! That's the only place you can see the google assistant made photos, but you have to cycle through the whole dang slideshow to get to that 1 picture and you can't skip past pictures. This is a hot mess and not user friendly any more."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app that no longer syncs with Computer! I think this app is fantastic, but I don't feel comfortable having my photos in one location (the cloud). They used to sync with the computer where I could delete pictures and organize folders much more efficiently than on my phone. As of July google stopped syncing photos. Please bring back a method syncing our precious memories."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You cant do anything unless signed in and synced. Terrible system if you like to keep things seperate. It agonizingly separates by day and refuses to let me organize anything. Never had this problem with previous gallery apps on older phones. If you do sign in and sync it bugs you to turn location on, give access to contacts, etc... I just want to take pictures, organize, and view them. I dont see why I have to sign in, sync, and deal with all this when it never used to be an issue. Please fix."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New update has ruined the editing tools. Used to be super easy to do light editing manually with the sliders and 3 menus (light, color, pop). Now each ""slider"" is separate and have to navigate a stupid menu layout. Instead of expanding features they actually cut down features and just made them more difficult and annoying to use. Couldn't be more backwards of an update."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Update 11/13/19: Reverted back to the bad way again! üòî 1 star. Update 11/4/19: Thank you for fixing that issue with editing pics. It's much, much better the original way, tapping the 3 dots in the upper right corner and selecting ""edit photo in..."" *OLD REVIEW*: I can no longer tap the dots in the upper right corner and select which program I want to edit the photo in. Instead it shows me photo details and a bunch of other useless stuff. This has been very inconvenient."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Phone storage is full. But can't transfer photos and videos to a laptop. Photos stay on phone. Used to be easier before Google photos app. Could clean the whole phone off and the phone would perform better. Such a simple procedure made difficult by trying to have too much control over my photos. AND showing me photos from a year ago without me asking is annoying. I hate the app. Give me the old fashioned Gallery app where it just held photos and video. I personally think they are looking....
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Having massive issue with the app. It's stuck on ""preparing to back up."" I've tried all the suggested solutions I can find and nothing has worked. It even seems to have failed to back up some old photos from 2016, but only a selection (even though I've been using the app for years!). I've even paid for additional storage, so I definitely shouldn't be experiencing issue like this! Please sort it out Google! I'm relying on you to save some very precious memories!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love Google Photos!!! It's great as an extra back up and the memory notifications are fun! I love the mini slide shows it creates also! I cant believe some of the photos that pop up sometimes.. Some I've forgotten, some I thought were lost... So i get a surprise here n there!! I get stuck on the app sometimes from browsing thru the photos and creating different albums!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't understand why they mix the folder screenshot with the camera!! It's horrible! I don't want to have all the screenshots messing up with the rest of my photos and wasting space there. You should change that feature right away. Also when I use the option of Free space in my phone then it's basically impossible to find the photos that were ""saved"" and it doesn't sync the whole folder even if it's activated to be sync in leaves many pictures without security copy!! So messy and hard to use!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New layout is worse than ever before. Why does it take SEVERAL clicks to get to your phones folders. I'm already in Photos, clearly I'm there because I want to access my photo albums. Now I have 1) to load Photos, 2) tap library 3) two view all next to ""photos on device"" THREE steps to see your photo albums when already inside a photo album app is a dreadful and horrible experience."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love Google Photos' interface but there are some bugs and improvements that could be made. Firstly, saved photos get zoomed in automatically after editing. Secondly, a dedicated button for rotating photos or a drag and rotate gesture would be more convenient. Lastly, some folders don't show up in the app. Fixing these issues would improve an already excellent app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Excellent for photo backup. I have to take points off for sync from phone to Google photo. It is delayed and sometimes don't even sync. Another big hassle is trying to download my photos back into my PC. There is no mass download like other apps. It compressed the files and put it into a rar then download it. Sometimes it takes a long long time. It seems like developer want you to be dependent on their app and not let you leave on e you saved your photo in their app.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent cloud backup service, but on some devices, the device's color settings result in Google Photos displaying images a lot darker than they should be. Uninstalling the app's updates (but not the app itself) in the Apps section of device settings is one way to fix the problem if you don't want to change your color settings (which I don't). I'd like to be able to update the app, but can't until Google fixes this. EDIT: this issue has been fixed for me (RAZER Phone 2, Android Pie/9)."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the features of Google photos! It It does a great job of differentiating faces. However, sometimes it will create two or even three files of the same person or pet. There is no way to merge them, even when I've put the same name on multiple files. There's also no way to make it make a profile for a new person. Both improvements would be great."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The latest updates has messed up the app completely! I can no longer delete any photos from within the app, nor can I move any of them to another folder on the device or external memory. Not to mention that it doesn't actually see any folders I create from within the Storage app in Settings. It has become completely and utterly useless!! I'm uninstalling it until this is fixed!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent photo app especially when paired with a Chromecast. Grandparents love having photos of their grandbabies appear on their TV. Functionality is intuitive and includes all the options you'd want. Just wish full resolution backup (for archival purposes) was available for devices other than Google Pixel. However, this service is still the best deal anywhere. Amazon Photos should take notes on the functionality."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this Google Photos App! It is such an easy app to use, store all my photos,videos,edits, it sends me stylised photos and clips of my videos that are actually worth keeping or sharing with friends and family. I love that I can select photos and share them easily with the people of my choice. I don't think I have even discovered all that this app can do yet!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great app. An absolute must to share pictures and videos with friends and family. Great for backups also. Another feature I love is that it automatically creates a panoramic picture out of photos you take. On my latest trip I just took a bunch of pictures of the place at different angles and the app did the rest automatically joining all the relevant pictures together. Outstanding!
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Photos pairs really well with the Pixel 7 and the features are really cool. However, as someone who likes to take pictures and to have freedom with the pictures I take, Google makes that a rather significant challenge, especially compared to the competition. The device's camera is pretty much the only consideration I make when purchasing a phone. I don't care for Googles storage, which can be turned off, but Pixel 7 is so in-your-face about unwanted storage, it's maddening."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app for many years now but the past year it's been doubling all of my photos and videos, doesn't let me choose folders i want to back up which i made, the double photos uses most of my space in the app, all the features are awesome but please fix these problems. I've years worth of memories in there. ***It's always backing up photos which are already backed up. It's always backing up 1000+photos of my albums."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"WTH..Woke up, photos had updated (had no freaking idea it was gonna happen), caused the loss of some very significant personal pictures of my late father in the locked photos area of the app that I'll never get back. Why fix something that wasn't broken in the first place? That being said, instead of disrupting the people who are happy with the way the app was, make a new app for the persons who want something new? Using my suggestion...people have the choice of what they prefer in an app!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The recent update made the app unresponsive just like Google Map/navigation. For the Map, I deleted the newest update and started working again, but for Photos, I had to uninstall/reinstall because this is not a default app on my phone. Once scanning and backups are done, recent albums didn't come back. They are gone. Those have lots of pics that my friends contributed, too. VERY disappointed."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is very good. I use it for all my photos. I really like the search feature where you can search for particular people/pets in photos. I would definitely recommend to anyone that wants to back up their photos/access WiFi. However I would like it if there was an option to ""highlight/select"" specific people/areas in the photo to name who they are. There are photos with 2/3+ people in and it only recognizes 1 person and I want to be able to highlight the different people to name them etc."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,great photo app. organizes my photos well. would have given it 5 stars but it will not allow me to store high-res raw photos on my SD card and view them through google photos at the same time like a thumbnail. so each photo taken has to be downloaded to SD card separately... not convenient for a professional photographer shooting on the fly out in nature or around town just for fun.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It works, but does not have a lockable folder. Additionally, it is ofern hard to navigate to various folders such as the screenshots. The presentation is not consistent. Also, if you don't have signal you can be blocked from viewing the photos on your camera roll. Maybe there is an option to view resident photos, but I haven't found it. A major fail. I have to download a separate app to view photos that are stored in the memory of my phone. What the hell? Otherwise it has some nice features."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The options are out of this world. You can set your camera to infinite gradations of raw, JPG, HRD+ etc settings. The app actually teaches even seasoned photographers more finely honed skills all the time. And it still allows you to revert to purely manual control. I wish I had this years ago, when I developed an interest in photography when my kids were little. You look at old photos from negatives and you cry. The dark sky option is an unbelievable bonus."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I DELETED EVERYTHING on my phone's gallery album. Every photo I have taken, that was stored on my phone. While trying to back up my files on the app a popup came up on the photos app asking to free up some space with no eleboration on what it was going to delete or from where and it did its work. The WORST PART, it completely bypassed the Samsung Gallery trash folder and Photos trash folder, making it PERMANENT. All unbacked files because my Google drive was full. How is that a even a feature?!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"They're just a distinct lack of ability to get back something that was deleted by ignorant people and myself by accident. I feel having a backed up stock of my photos, and a cooling off period of 3 days or so, to retrieve things you didn't in fact want deleted is just something I would have expected with this service. To be honest I don't even really understand beyond that what I'm paying for. The cool little animations and videos the phone makes each month is really good though!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I can't believe I stayed a decade locked to iOS and its photo app. Google Photos is awesome! To be better than the current one, however, would be giving the option to delete a photo from inside an album ‚Äî not only delete in the album, buy from everywhere, like the web version lets you. Also, offering unlimited storage to original size files won't hurt. üòÖ"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I love the platform and all of it's features I just wish they'd allow you more options to categorize and edit photos yourself. Like if I create a collage I want to be able to arrange the photos or center them better than the auto generated collage that will not allow me to reposiston the photo. The facial recognition only allows the system to pick faces but will not allow you to identify a person in a photo so that it will show in that individuals folder. But other than that I think it's üëçüèΩ.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Doesn't always seem to offer the same thing. I like consistency. The selection of photos vary and I've somehow got it looked to 3 email addresses.... I'm going to say with the help of Google's suggestions ..... My favorite thing is the color pop and I can't select the picture I want or do it when I want. Google photos decides.... Don't like it
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love this app totally(almostüòÖ)... But the feature I will love to see is; disabling a backed-up device folder from showing on the home page of the app(I'm sure you understand what I mean by ""home page"").. I wouldn't want anyone who holds my phone to be able to see all my backed up screenshots(it's crazy üåö)... And now I've backed-up a few pictures from there... My gallery is so messed up now ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòì"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Used to be a great app. Was a bit annoyed that google removed the automatic backup as an option a while ago, but usually remembered to open & back up every few days or so, but following the last update I have about 30 photos not backed up and it's stuck on 'Getting ready to back up' and saying I have nearly 4000 photos to back up? WTAF? It seems to think I have not backed up any photos... Ever... Despite them being visible when I actually look on my google account on the computer..."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is a great app. I love it. So easy to use. It automatically edits our photos and makes animations. It also makes awesome videos including photos and videos of a day. I love it very much. Bt the face grouping needs improvement. Hey Google please release an update where you can directly give name to the person while viewing the photo. I cannot find photos of some of my friends in the grouped section. So please do something
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall, the UI is great, and it has a ton of great features. It really is the best gallery I have ever used. My complaint is that you cannot do a mass download. If you need to download multiple pictures from the cloud to your device, you have to either do them one at a time of go onto the Google photos website wherein you can mass-download."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Started in a recent version to create artificial albums to make into a photo book which I would have to pay for. This album included pictures of dead animals taken for veterinary purposes together with sunsets. There needs to be an agreement first for photos to suggest items to album-ize, delete, etc - an 'opt-in', not an 'opt out'. And as to its suggestions for rotation! Its algorithms are way out."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Doesn't back up the album's you meticulously keep organized on your gallery, over many years, and when you go to archive to ""save space on device"" it loses all organization. it also seems to forget folders your previously set to back up and sync, and often can't see the folders which are in the same location as the other folders. Giving 2 stars because the search functionally beats gallery, but that's Google's job - searching."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Used to really love this app, but it's recently been giving me so many problems that I want to look for something else. Google Photos became incredibly slow, taking a long time to delete multiple photos and/or move them (even if it was only two). The app is now refusing to let me move certain photos at all, and, whenever I am deleting even one image, I have to stop the app completely before it shows that the photo has actually been deleted. App is updated, so I don't know why it's happening."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Some users find it frustrating that Google Photos doesn't have an option to lock the app to portrait mode, as the app automatically rotates to landscape view, which can be uncomfortable or inconvenient at times. It would be helpful for Google Photos to add a basic setting to disable auto-rotate and allow users to choose portrait mode. This would improve the overall user experience and accommodate those who prefer to use the app in portrait orientation."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"In the details of the photo this app doesn't display the albums that contain it, unlike the browser version, making managment much harder. When adding a photo to an album, albums are noy displayed alphabetically even if the option is checked on the browser version, thus you have to search for an album, among possibly many every time Adding to album as well takes a lot of time in waiting, seemingly at random, no matter how few or many photos you are adding at once."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"By far one of the worst Google products out there. No option to select all. Absolutely refuses to STOP syncing, thus causing me to run out of space on my Google account. In order to delete photos from here and not my phone, I have to delete the app because apparently Google can't figure out that we might want to delete from the app but keep on device. Unreal."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Mixed emotions with this. I love organising all my stuff that needs be. but I hate it when I put specific photos on a folder/album but right after doing so, it still stays on the photo menu. this can give confusion to users with a lot of photos to manage. im currently enrolled to a plan to check if this 'might' be a good cloud... but if things aren't gonna be simple, what would be the point."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's got some cool features, but it's also missing some really basic ones, like tagging and rating and arranging and easy ways to post to social media. I also really hate how quick it is to unselect all the photos that I take ages to select, either by accident, or because I added them to a set (even when I cancel that action). Overall, the app is a sad victim of the 'too many features scare away users' mentality that makes so many of today's apps underwhelming, and a lack of usability testing."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I don't like this app. I don't like how unorganized the app is. All I want is to be able to select a folder to begin with i.e. Internal Memory Card or SD Card and be able to have folders inside to make that organized. The app called ES File Explorer is everything I wished Google Photos was. I don't even know which photos are in the cloud and what's on my phone. This should be a very simple concept that is incredibly harder than it needs to be. You only need 3 tabs: Cloud, Internal, SD."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like this app. I would love to be able to make videos from the shared albums. I spent time finding pictures over a 4 year span, made the movie, clicked save and it just disappeared. If i could have done it right out of the shared album i wouldn't have spent 20 mins going through years of photos already organized in the shared album. Only to have to do it again and hope it saves the next time. very frustrating."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"An excellent gallery backup. It's my saviour. I hope there would be a backup option where the files are put in an identical separate folder as it was in my internal storage, instead of everything being all clumped up together so I no longer have to manually organize all my files once it's in the app again to increase convenience. Other than that, very well done."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Great photos quality and I love the integration with all of Google and my nest devices and Chrome cast. I love the idea. However organizing the photos into folders or sorting them, deleting unused photos except the ones you choose in folder is impossible. Organization is a nightmare with this app. And sharing a photo is just insulting a slap in the face. This app makes it frustrating to share photos. They force you to share a link that brings your friends to your google page."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Loving the redesign, it's cleaner, attractive and much easier and fun to navigate my all-time favourite photos app. I love the new features especially the ability to see people's faces inside the search tab - that's so handy. At first I didn't think I would love the new logo when I saw it in articles, but seeing it in my app, I love it as it looks like a happy and energetic logo ready to show those wonderful memories. Keep it up!"

I have a daily time lapse folder I use, and now, on my phone, it's nowhere to be found in my millions of albums. Used to be near the top, because I add to it daily. If there's a way I can fix this, please point me in the right direction!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really love all the storage I get from this app. I can easily access my pictures through any App I'm using, if necessary. The only downside is the editing options could be far greater. I'm okay with using it to just store everything, even though I would really rather not have to download separate apps just to edit and store them separately."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Superb search function, of course! Love the new tools that have been introduced recently, especially magic eraser. It's amazing to see family photos flashing on our Google Nest screens throughout the house. Would love to see ways of editing specific parts of each image, not just the image overall. Collage function is meh, get yourself a dedicated app if you like to do that sort of thing."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is a terrible and invasive app. I do not use it for myself, but people share photos with me so I access it sometimes. Everytime I open it on my phone it ""uploads"" all of my personal photos and videos into the app and stores them, basically doubling the space those files take up on my device and filling up my storage. Sometimes the app glitches and it temporarily applies all of the files others share with my to my google storage and makes it so I can't receive new emails."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"10/28/20 - never seen an app updated so much, but even more annoying to always have to remember to reinstall back onto SD (minus 1 ‚òÖ).... Super easy to use. Automatic organization for what would otherwise be a cluttered mess and probably lost forever memories. Best photo sharing & storage app that I've used. Never have to worry about ""did it save it"" ;).. My only wish would be that Android originally started out with this from the very beginning"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Can't live without it. The best app for people like me who love taking pictures but run out of space quickly because of all the content and very little space. It's very convenient because it's just a click away rather than having so many memory cards or external hard drives etc. The app also provides an editing feature which also makes movies for you to either save as is or edit/make your own. Definently check it out.

I manually tried to backup. A spinner widget keep spinning at the top of the app with a message ""getting your photos"". It does not and is killing the battery. I updated the app. Also uninstalled and reinstalled. Doesn't fix the problem. Googling the issue suggested to clear the cache and clear the data. Doing that stopped it from detecting the camera folder. Please help."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Awful functionality related to clearing up space. Deletes all photos off of device -- fine, as intended -- but no method of bringing all the photos back into Camera folder or even bringing more than one picture at a time. Add that to the fact that any photos, once removed from your device, only show up in the app and are unable to be found by other applications is completely backwards. Also, why do we have to enable Google Drive sync to find the backed-up photos? The Assistant features in this app are gimmicky and the 'space saving' functionality are wildly broken."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This application is absolutely fantastic! I love the automatic effects it does with various pictures and videos. You can save & keep the ones you like and discard the ones you dont. I also like that this application helps me to keep plenty of open storage space on my cellphone by backing my photos & videos up automatically to my google account. My only issue with the application is it uses WAY to much data, which is a total bummer. Otherwise, like I said before, it's fantastic!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The only complaint I have is the app is glitchy. I was adding a bunch of photos to a photobook I was gonna have printed and it didn't save it all... only up to page 13 and I had so many more that I spent so much time on. Soooo disappointing! All the tools and options are so nice and convenient til it doesn't want to work. The app crashes a lot.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app works great. But when it recommends to you to back up photos from your gallery to Google photos it does NOT mention it deleting them from your device. I know me and a lot of other people have had the same experience. If you want those photos back, you have to INDIVIDUALLY download each one which is BIZARRE. How can you not select many to save to your device at once? Then you have to put in a lot of unnecessary effort just to get the pictures back on ur device. Good app but fix this pls."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"THIS APP SUCKS! You can only select photos by each day, so if you have sorted your photos into your own folders, they will all get jumbled up when you try and create a new folder to share. And you can't ""select all"" so it takes FOREVER! AND, it links to your photos on your phone, so when you run out of room, which you will, and it asks you to PAY for more storage space, so if you try and save space on your backed up folder by deleting them, it will ALSO delete the original copy from your phone!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Easy to use, great add-ons, and assistant is helpful. But it crashes a little too often for my liking. Also when trying to archive large numbers of photos it just wouldn't do it. Originally I thought I was hitting an archive limit but it didn't seem to matter how many I archived. App can be a bit buggy for me, enough for me to notice and get frustrated."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Free unlimited backup at great resolution with smart suggestions for archiving. enhancing and organizing my images. Photos has an amazing capability to categorize images by each person in my family.

I highly recommend this app for ease of use, stability and functionality."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is my favorite photo app! I love that it backs up my phone's photos automatically. I love that I can create a link and share a video easily to friends and family. I love creating albums from events so that everyone invited can post photos and videos to share. I love the search feature, especially being able to search for specific people and even animals. I love the animations and videos and color pops that are left as little treats for me by the ""assistant."" And the editing is strong, too!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The reason I left two stars but not one is because the app works for the most part. The reason I gave it a low rating is becuase the backup feature is completely useless. I trusted Google that I could back up my photos to Drive. I then factory reset my phone and when I opened my Google Photos app, all that was there was backed up photos from back in 2017 and before. I felt my face get hot and I just felt grief for all the photos I lost. I'm never trusting Google with my photos again."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"""Storage management"" app that is unclear with some of the high-impact functionalities like ""free up space"", which essentially erases everything from your phone. A problem that wouldn't be terrible if the user is provided with either an ""undo"" or a ""download selected"" option. I just wasted 2 days of my life downloading 7000 pictures ONE BY ONE and then re-adding metadata or custom photo edits (which are also deleted when uploading in the cloud). ""Tedious"" doesn't even begin to describe it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Would be great if I could set one of these photos as my lock screen or home screen wallpaper. This app is so dysfunctional it does nothing that I want. I tried selecting the photo and couldn't find anything about setting it as wall paper. Now the app won't even open. It keeps insisting that I'm missing out and must upgrade. When I try to do that just keep circling back. I really expect better from Google. Would like to select all and download everything to my phone. That does not seem to possibl
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google photos is an increasingly improving application. I am impressed by the results of the team of people in charge of its vision and implementation. They have handled the data issue fairly well and consistently and it is the best open, free integrated solution on the market that im aware of. I do really enjoy the call backs to previous times and photos, it really is a considerate and good feature that I greatly appreciate."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely love Google Photos. You can customise so much in the app, & I'm always finding new things to do. You can use the magic eraser to remove something in the photo you don't like (like the mother-in-law! Lol), which is a great feature. You can create movies from photos & videos or just a lovely collage. You can also order photo books too, either in paperback or hardback. This review & features available are based on my Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra. Features may be different on other phones."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"My favorite photo app until the last update removed the ability to share photos to album. This means that I can't do anymore the two thing below, which to me are essential. 1. I need to have a picture on my phone to add it to an album. Before I was able to add photos that other people have shared with me to an album without the need to downloaded them to my phone and than add them to an album defeating the purpose of having photos in the cloud 2. I can't search or look at my photos and simply select the one that I would like to add them to an album. Now that Google has removed the possibility to share photos to album, the only workaround that I have found is click on each single photo, click on the 3 dots on the top right, select add to album. This is not a sensible. The only way that I have to add more than one photo at a time to an album is to go to the album and click add photo, the problem with this approach is that it just show me all images on my phone in chronological order without the possibility to search or add photos that have been shared with me (it only access the photo on my phone). PLEASE BRING BACK THIS ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONALITY"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"About 2 month ago the dates in this app got completely jumbled. I could't fix it, so I tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Unfortunately this deleted all the pictures in my locked folder without warning (I guess they warned me when I set up the folder long ago - but that really isn't enough attention to make users aware at the relevant time). But the uninstallment never quite finished, so it is stuck ""uninstalling"" and I cannot even update (or get rid of notifications I should update)."

For instance, I have a Screenshot Folder but it doesn't appear on the available folders on the Google Photos App. Fix it! Please."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Here are some of the reasons this app gets one star from me: 1 If you back up everything, good luck trying to download it all back to your device if you don't have acces to a computer. 2 It simply doesn't seem to understand the concept of folders. It lumps everything together and makes it ultra frustrating to organize things. 3 If you want to move a pic from a backed up folder to a folder from your device's storage, not possible. 4 It's like Google put in extra effort to make things difficult"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Pretty awesome app! It's nice to have all my pics in one place without taking up all the storage on my phone. Love that the assistant organizes all my pictures as they're taken too. It even organizes them by the holiday or location they were taken at. You can also use the app to order and print the pictures you have. Which is awesome if you need to come up with a unique, personal and heartfelt present. Im sure there are some drawbacks to the app but currently can't recall what they were."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Don't really understand why I'm not able to pick the order and placement for photos in collages and animations. Sort of defeats the purpose if they all go in there randomly and cropped terribly. You also can't adjust the size of the boxes when printing photo books. It's very frustrating. Other than that, it's not awful. But I don't understand how none of the developers has realized that this is stupid by now. You can do that with literally any rinky dink photo app on here. Why not Google photos?"

My only issue with it is that after the new updates the face grouping hasn't been working right.

There were no error messages or anything; it just keeps trying to upload the darn thing. It's still doing it right now, in fact, and it's clogging up other uploads."

Now that the new Samsung Galaxy's are unable to hold extra memory cards I've been trying to use the ""Free up space"" feature and everytime I try it the app crashes on me. I've tried reinstalling and updating the app and nothing works. I've sent reports over the last 2 months."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Awesome photo app and i have love this. It is a good thing that we can store and backup our photos into google account. But need to be some more development such as album hiding features, lock appilication, album arrangements, album layouts, Drag and drop options, include and exclude options etc... Duplicate photos and unnecessary folders with adds and stickers, those all are annoying me. So please try to fix these problems and make the app some more awesome. Thank you"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"1: An editing feature, that can be used to add black bars to a picture, so the picture can be shaped as a square is needed (I have to use Snapseed just for this). 2: The highlights feature is annoying and unnecessary. We should be able yo disbale it. 3: There is no way to download multiple photos or videos. You have to download each photo or video separately."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I really like using this app for my photos. It's very easy to organize and edit you photos on the fly. I like making folders to organize my photos. It also makes cool slide shows of things I did. That's really nice. It also makes panoramic photos of pictures that go together without me doing anything. I really just like this app. But to fare it's came on my phone and has been on every phone I have had.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is great for storing, but very difficult to personalize to your liking. The app stores everything randomly, and doesn't let you organize anything. You can't create folders, or edit them. And it NEVER backs up photos from my device camera, no matter if you turn your settings on for that, I always have to upload each file manually. I lost precious family photos when I thought the app was already doing that, then had to reset my phone to factory setting. By far, the worst google app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I hate GP with a passion. I'm not a disgruntled user, I'm just baffled at the lack of control one has over this app. How do I prevent my Pixel's cleanup to delete specific folders? you can't! backup & sync switch is useless, it'll backup and synch whatever it feels like. It backed up my files! great! it disregarded all my internal directories though! so all my memes containing ferrets are cleverly, and very, very sophisticatedly triaged into an AI-generated folder named ""ferrets""! wut??!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall this is a great app. I'm lucky to have extra storage through Google one. If I didn't, I would probably have to buy additional storage which in my opinion should be free. Also would love to see more editing options to keep up with other free apps available. I love that I can have all my Google apps connected and synced on all my devices."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Apsolute worst app!!! Many of my photos has disappeared!!! Like it white but u can't see the pics!!! It loads (like the rotating thingy) and it takes forever but never loads!!! I have downloaded gallery and it works the best... If there was a option of 0.0000001 star I would have gave that. And if u say to update,restart or software update it then it doesn't works at all! And the photos doesn't even back up. This app deserves to be 0.0000000000000000001 stars!!!! Fix the problem üëøüëøüëø!!!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I don't know if it's an android thing or this app, but I hate that if you have the back up on, whatever pics you delete are put back in the photo folders!! So irritating! I deleted them!! (Yes, I deleted them permanently from the trash folder!) I also don't like that now that I did the most recent update, whenever I edit a pic, my only save option is ""save copy"". I do a lot of editing and the last thing I want to do is have to delete a bunch of extra copies of originals! Lame!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Obcessed with photography from a young age, I have worked with photos on computers and phones for years, and I can honestly say Google photos does the best job I've seen. I only give it five stars because it truly shines in all the areas I care about: Ease-of-use is high. Simple to edit, store, and share photos individually or in groups. Storage is automatically managed and I don't think I've ever run out of space THANKS to the cloud storage algorithms keeping things backed up and cleaning up"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why can't Google allow the owners to choose an option that allows them to delete from the cloud storage without deleting them from the device. I am going to use my own completely cloud isolated storage to save photographs as well as on my computer. I like the way it shows photographs from past years. However, the storage management is extremely frustrating."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It is quite good but it lacks some simple things that can be used in photo editing. eg to be able to pain in colour like you could before. Or to actually change forward pictures color and those in the back scenes another color. These little things would really help. Except for that this is not a bad app Also with a slideshow or making a movie before you had the app so the picture could be kept in a square photo with a fuzzy background with now just a photo nothing more.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google photos does it all; stores, categorizes and even reminds you to upload photos. This is a very handy and worthy app for any modern person who has a large picture library that doesn't want to clutter up your phone or be able to share you photos all at once in one clean, easy acessable space. It even goes as far as facial recognition, so if you have friends or family that you take a lot of pictures of you can set it to know who they are every time. This is a great app and I recommend it!!!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My phone just malfunctioned today and I had to do a factory reset. So thankful my work was backed up by Google. A nature photographer there's more than 30,000 images. I'd be lost without the help of Google in keeping them neatly sorted in albums or folders. This app is useful in many ways and keeps getting better in my opinion. Thanks Google couldn't make it without you. Id never find anything if I had too go through thousands of photos. You've spoiled me and I thank you for it"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The photo suggestions are fantastic! Sometimes ill tale multiple photos of a landscape and stitch them together, but Photos will have that as a suggestion if I don't get to it right away. I also like the slide show option you can add to your phone's home screen. There are several settings so you can cycle through your most favorite photos and moments. There's even frams and size choice. The editor isn't too bad, either. Although I prefer photoshop or paint shop pro. ü§î üòÅ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Google has just did a bad upgrade. I loved the older photo editing system that allowed us to change the hues the black and whites the shadows the highlights etc. Now google seems to think that the customer has no artistic training and they have only three choices to edit photos with to make things easier. Well those 3 google edits Suck!!!! Change it back!!!!
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The best photo viewing/editing app I've found. Also, super awesome that Google stores them for you! Not only that, while google is trying to go to bed, he browses through all the pics to get tired. While snooping, he fixes lighting, makes collages, panoramas, all sorts of great ideas! And then randomly reminds you of back when you were with your ex... Four years ago today would be your anniversary!!! Or back when you still had a front tooth... Look how good you looked just a year ago, today!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What happened to the good ole days when you could plug it in the laptop drag and drop in the folder, now it automatically saves it to and pain to get out of the cloud. It also is automatically creating movies from my photos, if I wanted a movie I would have made a video and not taken pictures. Go back to easy to use version."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"With all due respect, this app is riddled with issues. And, is somewhat praisable ONLY because it does store your photos. But that's about it. Moreover, if any photo(s) are deleted in error; the recovery process is a NIGHTMARE. (No ""Direct"" Customer Service or Contact #). Therefore, one would have to ask themselves why store any photos on this app at all; if they are not retrievable once deleted in error or otherwise. Which makes you think the safer choice is to save your photos onto an SD card."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love how it backs up all my photos and then I can delete all old pictures in the gallery to make room for new pictures or videos. The new feature that have been upgraded to fixing any problems with color brightness or darkness in the pictures is perfect for me cause sometimes I forget to adjust the lighting in the background causing accidental pictures taking in not enough or too much light and also I'm liking how I have options of keeping or deleting duplicates of photos in data space.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The only reason I give this two stars is because you can do some cool things with Google photos. None awe inspiring however. My biggest complaints includ the fact I have to share everything that's in photos with the rest of the world, navigation through the UI, as well as the plain weird behaviors its been made to have. I had a list prepared but I only have 500 characters. In conclusion, Not impressed. More confusing than helpful. Wish I could remove it and use a different service all together."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's amazing to me this happened because Google has always been top rate but when it comes to pictures they should stay away from it!!! I had a terrible experience with this application there's no way to find a picture you do something on a picture and the folder moves which is irritating in order to find a picture you have to change somewhat with the internet which are not willing to do my last phone was a LG stylist application for pictures on it was simple you could see your albums in square
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really like this app. The only thing I wish they'd change is that anytime I share a photo to someone within the app, it always starts a new ""conversation"" with that person. For example, my fiance and I are always sharing photos of our pets with each other, but instead of one clean thread containing all of our shared pet photos, there are like 20 different threads with no clear method to the madness. If Google fixed this one issue, the app would be perfect."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Can you please explain to me why does the app creates another folder called ""camera"" which already exists on my phone and it's the only folder I wanna back up. But the camera folder this app creates contains all pictures on my device and I can't turn auto sync off because camera folder is backed up automatically... Seems like you just want to browse my pics to me :)"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I actually rly like google photos. It is kinda bittersweet at times. When you're looking at some items the app creates for you like the ""from _____ year(s) ago today"" pictures. It brings back memories and reminds you of certain events/people/things that you almost let slip past your memory. Also i wouldnt be surprised if you're actually able to turn off these features (like the ""moments"") etc. Personally, I like the things the app makes generally. Plus the app, at least for me, runs smoothly."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When I go to add a photo or video to an already-created album, the only default sort setting (filter) is to sort the list by the ""most recently modified albums"" first, with no other options to sort. With how many albums I have, that is inefficient and super annoying. Change it so I can sort my albums alphabetically for a great experience (when adding a photo or video to an album). STILL NOT FIXED 1 YEAR LATER FFS"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I loved Google photos from the moment I started using it properly. What I kind of hate is that after the summer 2020 update the interface is no longer user friendly. It has lost a big part of the intuitive design. I find it hard to scroll thru the tabs looking for simple stuff like shared albums or utilities that used to be only 1 click away. I hope maybe with the next updates the interface will be improved to a more intuitive and simple design. Until then 3 stars instead of 5.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app was perfect when it had the option to only sync while charging. Whenever I'm reaching a Wi-Fi my phone battery will just die in minutes, as it struggles to upload. And switching the sync on and off everytime I'm low on battery seems inappropriate, given that the option was there in previous versions. Google Team, please take care of this somehow, otherwise my rating is going to stay on 2 stars only."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It can't even find the photos that are clearly on my phone. My photos are in folders in the obvious locations in my phone. Other apps don't have that trouble. Google Assistant is not helpful, either. This app is absolutely useless for sharing photos. Maybe a help feature would be useful. I'd be more than happy to give this product of positive review if there was something positive I could say about it. Funny thing is the app works fine on my PC. Is the problem with my Motorola phone?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It was great but the most recent update has all my photos scattered. I am having to click each one by one and tell it to a certain person. I cannot merge into an existing person. It only allows me to add a new person unless I change it by each photo not their batch of possible person(s). The app keeps freezing after each person. I have to close out of the app, clear my background apps and reopen the app to click on a new person each time. It's very long and painful. I have thousands of photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's ok. Was better. Recently it won't take me straight to my photos. I am only interested in photos I have taken. This app includes all the rubbish from social media, and no way toexclude folders, which results in a lot of clutter. Can't use .nomedia files because I want to exclude media from other apps, without preventing those apps from working."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Make takeout better. In details takeout info is added original info is removed. Duplicate fixed is a must required add on.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It offers to clear up space then everything you had synching in separate folders is removed!! and thrown back in to the main pictures folder. Also, unable to navigate to pictures from some apps. VERY poor user experience. Options are not consistent. Sharing a photo via text takes several steps if you don't want to dend a link. Rediculous. Amazon photos is way better."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,A great app with a MASSIVE FLAW that never gets fixed. I love using Google Photos and open it many times a day on my phone. Unfortunately there is a HUGE problem that has been an issue for years. The app saves MASSIVE amounts of data in the background to your phone in Photos Data storage and quickly climbs to 6-9 GB of data! It cannot be cleared by wiping cache. The ONLY way to remove it is to delete all the app's data and setup your account again from zero. FIX IT GUYS! THIS IS RIDICULOUS!
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"mostly positive. i like that it keeps my photos on the cloud and that i can use google apps to switch info from phone to phone. but my pixel 3 had an issue with this app where it restarted randomly as i was backing a LOT of stuff up to the cloud and about a 3rd of the photos were corrupted when it started back up again, even on the cloud, even on my phone. also, it says in the description of the app that you can upload unlimited photos and videos for free but you really only get 15 gb"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Photos will regularly disappear with no explanation - they haven't moved to a new folder, been archived, or been saved only to my device, they're just gone. I am often unable to move pictures to different folders which makes it impossible to organize anything, and the backup option is shoddy at best. It can be difficult to remove as your default photo app because it's so connected to other google services, but I highly recommend finding an alternative if you can!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've been very pleased, but something in the new version removes my zoom when I take a photo. I'll zoom in, hit the button, and then the picture isn't zoomed at all. If I do it twice usually the 2nd photo will come out like I want, but it's frustrating. Especially because the clarity of the photo isn't the same when I try and crop it compares to the clarity when I zoom in."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Bad and next to useless! The photo transfer is arbitrary, some photos are missing and the ones that are transferred cannot be sorted by chronological order! Your idiotic app just deleted a huge amount of my photos after I clicked on ""Free up space"" thinking that it will empty the bin and delete leftovers. Instead it deleted the photos from my phone!!! I needed them on my phone even when I don't have internet connection! That function didn't specify how it will ""free up space""!!! Idiotic app!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"""Free up space"" just made me lose 8.9GB of photos. Everything from the gallery is gone and ""available"" in the drive in an unorganised manner. Good luck finding that one meme you downloaded from reddit. There is no way for me to sort the images back and download them to my phone except going through every single one of them and sorting them manually. Life would be so much easier if the images were saved with proper albums as in the phone so that if the user wants them back, they can be downloded."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Might Have A Solution! If the update is causing you not to see shared albums or photos sent to other users or yourself (I have two accounts) then uninstall google photos to downgrade the update. I can now see photos I sent to my other account and shared albums that I wasn't able to see even though I received a notification and clicked on it. Hope this helps if you are having the same issue. :)
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Automatically deletes photos if they look too similar to each other, so if you want to take multiple pictures and get the right angle you have to use the burst feature. The app starts having more issues whenever an update is due, and as I'm writing this none of the videos I'm taking are showing up in my camera roll. Overall a rather frustrating app that I hope doesn't come pre-downloaded on the next phone I buy."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Can't save photos from saved library anymore, was a great feature. Now I have to uninstall and reinstall the app every time I want to save a photo from shared library. Edit: still not fixed. I even went and got a new phone and it doesn't work. How hard is it to make the function ""save"" work? I hit save and it says saved them the save button appear again and it's like I never saved it to my library. Don't offer a feature that doesn't work, looking into different apps."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Latest update is a disaster. Any attempt to look at photo detail prompts a crash with suggestion to reinstall app, which ""did not install correctly' (not true). I reinstalled the first time I saw this. The only effect was the permanent deletion of settings. Still crashes regularly. Although, I went back into the app for a more specific example and it didn't crash. Must be scared by threat of a bad review. Three stars to keep it on its toes. Update: Of course that article isn't helpful, Google."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I need an easy camera for work. I had to add software to shrink photos to put more than two in a report. It may or may not take a photo when it clicks. It will go to video on it's own. Too many selections to set-up. Then it hides similar photos in a stack you may overlook. Next stop I-phone for $1700 more. I guess for home use this would be OK. I found better and uninstalled this.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I find this app very useful since I can switch between phones seamlessly without losing my photos. However I wish there was better sorting and searching, especially in the archive section where I sometimes feel like I'm going to lose an image. I also would like to have the option to group by fictional characters,vehicles, abstract or similar groups among others. Other than that this is a very well done app and I love the service it provides."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"(Was) great for keeping photos safe and easily accessible. love it. Edit:Such a shame about the change of policy. My storage is almost full already and it's only just begun, signed up because of the unlimited photo storage that is now limited. 2 stars removed. Now I'm forced to pay. I have years of photos backed up there. Where will it end. 100gig gets full before you know it you'll be paying $100s a year to keep your photo's there. Might have to go back to floppy disc's in a case as my back up."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Since redesign it is less useful as a photo managing tool on the device, but now it's taking it longer and longer to be able to see photos saved from any app. They will show up in any other apps, but photos won't see them for anywhere from 5mins to a few hours. I could deal with an aesthetic redesign that adds steps to browsing my photos, but not being able to see them when they're exported from apps on the same device for so long makes no sense."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's always doing that annoying thing where it gets the date groupings wrong on the main Photos page, even though the metadata on the individual photos is correct. Please fix that bug already, it's been happening for years. Also, the Memories feature is seriously broken. I have photos going back 10+ years yet for the past year or more it only shows me highlights from 1, 2, 3, and 4 years ago. I've tried all the solutions your bot suggests."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"For the love of God, STOP automatically moving my pics to internal storage! If is say I want them on the SD card, it's for a reason! 20 updates later, how is this still an issue? Original review: Functional, but EVERY time it updates (like every week), it defaults to internal storage and moves all my pics. Have to move them back to SD card each time Edit: The issue of storage being changed seems to have finally been fixed a few revisions ago. Much better!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Lack of sorting options severely hinders its usability. There are no custom sorting options of any kind in the album section, like by size (to easily find the largest files), name (immensely helpful when you're viewing numbered documents / screen shots) or date created / modified. The only useful features are the smart search & photo backup which I rely on in daily basis or I'd have disabled this app long ago."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"One of the worst apps because it creates a trash folder without asking for your permission, then every time the user deletes a photo the app keeps the photo in a separate folder, then, I have to double delete every video and photo. The app should only show the videos and pictures and not create trash folders because trash folders are useless and take up space."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is pretty good to backup and manage photos. But recently I found a problem. Images that I download from facebook are saved in a separate folder named ""Facebook"". But in Photos app there is no such folder. Instead facebook images are shown in ""Camera"" folder and these images are also backed up. But don't want Facebook images to be backed up. Please solve the issue."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like some of the features, but have run into problems with permissions or lack there of when trying to delete or move photos that I've copied between two Google accounts. They copy fine, but on the receiving end, they get stuck. Also, trying to delete photos from the main screen that you want to keep, but don't want them displayed all the time. So, I'll give it a middle of the road 3 stars at this point."

As my daughter grows older and I am able to capture moments and memories with the comfort of knowing that they will be there on laptop, as I switch devices, etc. I just wish the Google Photos app on my Roku formatted to full screen pics rather than a "" sliver "" size in middle of screen... don't know if that's a Google Photos thing or a Roku thing. App is essential regardless....also enjoy some of the animations/collages...."

I used to look forward to reviewing my ""1 year ago, 2 years ago, etc..."" and sharing them with my loved ones. Now they are a disorganized mess."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Such a shame that I have to leave the factory app because of these following reasons. 1, your online guide is out of date and innacurate regarding changing data sync. 2, this shouldn't be an issue, this should be easy. Same issue goes for your contacts app. 3, no matter what I do guide or not, I cannot move photos to other folders minutes after taking the photo. It always has some sort of 'trouble' and your guide is as useless as if I didn't look anything up."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It does everything I want. All my photos and videos after backed-up to any chosen account automatically and I have an unlimited capacity to keep my photos and videos on hand without having to take up any storage on my phone. The app also makes videos for me when I take multiple pictures on one day, titles them (ex. Day at George Lake), and adds background music. Google Photos has a facial recognition feature so you can make albums with different people and the app also gives you throwbacks!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"If it was possible to give 10 stars, I would be giving 10 stars. This makes scrapbooks, animations based on your photos, perfectly placed where they were taken and puts it into albums that make it easily searchable for you. I use this app every single day! Saves all old photos so if I lose my phone, all of them are safe and stored for me. Life saver and a blessing!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"There are lot of inconveniences. I don't want all the photos to be moved from internal storage to google photos. The folders gets messed up. When sync is off, we can not access already backed up photos. To access them, we have to turn it on, and then again, all the photos gets backup to google. The collage feature is good though."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am taking pictures every day and this app has slowly become my defacto method of centralizing these pictures and it is great. You can count on it, and the compressed version is amazing. I just heard that Google is capping the drive size for files associated with this process. This is why I never trust anything free. You almost changed that Google. Obviously zero stars when the cap happens, and I'll start planning how to stop utilizing anything else I depend on that you make."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was surprised how much easier it made keeping track of all of my photos & videos. I take lots of pics. I also love to download pins from Pinterest. It's perfect for getting & staying organized. You can swiftly scroll through all you've saved & organized, with little effort & time involved. When you have a kazillion pics & videos, it could take forever to find what you're looking for. Thankfully, with this app, you can access your precious memories on the go! ‚ô•Ô∏è Lov!!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App used to be great and easy to use. Now it forces you onto the cloud, and photos are missing presumably deleted. The search feature is poor and often unable to find photo. Folders are a mess, and photos come up randomly all over the place. Recommendations would be to strongly stay clear of this app... or possibly better still, see what Apple has to offer."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So happy this app was created. The app saves all my photos automatically. I have photos and videos from more than 15 years ago saved all in 1 spot. Also love the search feature. You can search for the most random thing and it will find you every image and video that contains that item, for example, airplane and it will show all images that were taking on a plane or near a plane etc. Thank you Google."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google Photos is easily one of the best ways to backup your entire photo collection. Unlimited high resolution photo storage for free, I thought that sounded too good to be true but I've been using it for years, thousands of maximum resolution pictures all neatly organized and displayed for me, uploaded automatically so I don't even have to think about it. Minimal work, massive peace of mind in having everything backed up in its original quality."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I love Google. I really do but I'm starting to lose my faith in them. There's no reason why a simple photo app should cause headaches. I don't even have enough available characters in this review to list all my complaint about this app. I seen many other reviews with my same complaints so I'm assuming Google has no plans on changing things. I'm just going pull everything out of Photos and Drive and move over to Microsoft's OneDrive since I have a free 1TB there anyways.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm really enjoying the app, it's amazing. I just have a suggestion, if you guys can modify so I can browse my backed up photos in folders, just as I backed it up! If you can include it as an option apart from grouping the pictures. This will really save a lot of time I spend searching for a particular picture in the past. Great job guys!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I always enjoy Google Photos. I especially love how they create a large flashback of photos in the proper timeline. It's also fairly easy to look back on photos from previous years. From time to time they also send me Stylized Photos. They are fun to look at and save me the hassle to filer out a photo myself. Never had any issues whatsoever. I would recommend Google Photos to anyone who is starting their own account.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I find the app so awkward to use and navigate. Automatically saving photos into seperate files is fine but atleast have a ""photo roll"" option that all pictures go into so I can find what I'm looking for. I also find that, when posting photos on other apps (eg twitter), half the time the picture that I want to post doesn't show up (usually because it's in a different folder). I also don't find it easy to transfer the pictures from my phone to my pc. It just feels overthought.."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to use this app exclusively to backup my photos across multiple generations of phones (Android and iPhone). Even had my family get the app to save their photos. However, I can no longer recommend this app because of the one feature I loved is going away, the unlimited photo upload. I have nearly a decade's worth of photos sitting there and now suddenly they just yank away the feature, knowing so well there are many photos saved there?? Completely unacceptable."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I dont like it. It is intrusive. I don't like that the changes were made involuntarily. When the app digs up photos from the past, it is very painful, like a deceased love one. When I want to look at photos, I will in my own time, not popping up randomly, inappropriately. I don't like the thing about ordering a print, either, or that my photos come on all my devices. Please revert to how it was before the apo made all those changes. Too complicated. And please let me decide what is clutter."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's nice to see that the app creates albums of different people In ur lyf it's a very great way of organization. It's also easy to move the photos when u change phones with use of Google account. Despite the fact that some photos that might have been taken over a while don't usually load or use a lot of data to load it's still a reliable app. Also when a video or photo is edited it comes out blurry or pixelized. It wud be great if that was fixed
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I really hate this app now. It should be a simple photo gallery but it's really annoying. If you take a photo such as a silhouette it has annoying popups trying you to ""fix the exposure"". If you take a screenshot it has annoying popups trying you to ""search inside screenshot"". Yes, we know about your new features. You don't need to tell us on every single picture. I've tried to disable it in settings but they are still there. It's irritating and distracting. Please fix this."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app, 5 stars, but I would like to have a setting that would stop that ""Clean the device"" from appearing 'cause I want to keep the originals too. I clicked it once and it didn't even ask if I really want to do that. Hopefully I think it got only to trash so I could recover them. Anyway, I love the assistant part.. it just made the funniest Movie out of my videos and photos taken today. Love it!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"After using the Google photo app for a year, it's still confusing. I like that I can sort photos by album, but the albums aren't visible to all your accounts. This means if I want to do cross posting on multiple accounts or platforms, I can't access all the folders. Another really stupid thing is, if I want to give access to another one of my email accounts, they treat it like you're sharing info with a total stranger. AND you can only share with ONE account. Please make it easier for posting!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Everything i place into an album gets auto deleted without me doing anything. Downloaded hundreds of photos which gets placed into the download section of the phone and doesn't get touched. As soon as i set up albums to better organize what photos are of what, overnight they all disappear without a trace. I have backup and sync off, which means the ability for google photos to delete everything that has been backed up is also off. Means there is no reason for this to happen. This app is trash."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Pretty good. I've had better and worse. I don't like that when I text a friend a pic they have to view it through the Google album book vs. seeing it in the text I just sent them. Wish there was more filters and options for creativity, Or that I can name my own picture folders.Sometimes the pics I marked up disappear or won't show up for me to text. It's like a scavenger hunt trying to find the pics I edited."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really like how this app stores my pics and I don't have to keep them on my phone taking up valuable space. I also like how it restores content to other devices in the case of having to get new devices. in that case, I don't lose pics and vid that are meaningful to me. I enjoy the collages and/or movies it puts together. Best part is that it is all free."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really good app. Keeps photos without taking up all that space on ph. So easy to manage with sorting options, delete, restore, backup & share easily. You can even create albums, print & order prints on canvas, etc. Plus support for questions & how-to instructions. Except, it no longer gives the option to restore photos back to my phone's gallery. Why was that removed & will you please add that much needed option back to the Google Photos App?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"More harm than good. Since it auto backs up everything it quickly fills your storage, which is shared with gmail. Recently they seem to have made it much harder to not back up stuff and I can no longer figure out how to exclude specific photos and videos from backup except by deleting them from my phone entirely. It's otherwise a good app but since this ""feature"" means you need to choose between having gmail and not having photos or videos on your phone it's much more harm than good."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I would love to give 5 stars, but so far I am not able to use this as a backup rather than a plain sync feature. I would love to keep my photos in the cloud, so I can delete them from my device. Save space and all that... perhaps I'm stupid... üòÜ But for this reason I feel its lackinga significant feature. If this feature is not needed for you, it's a good tool! :)"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love all the things that Google Photos does on its own; creating stylized photos, making collages & photo books (that you can edit and swap less favorable pics for the one's you love) and asking to archive photos you don't need one your library! It keeps things very organized and super easy to find. And it just keeps getting better!! Oh.. my favorite thing is that I can share specific photos or albums with anybody, even when the file size is too large to text or email.. ‚úå&üíö"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love to receive notifications from the app with a new clip, movie, or collage that are made with my pics from years ago. l really really like this app. I also like that it saves all my pictures whenever WiFi is available, so I don't have to worry about that. There are things that can be improved (like the editing feature, pretty boring or you have to pay to access better options), but I definitely recommend this app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This new business of showing past pictures in a fast abbreviated slide show rather than simply loading that point in your album is horrible. 1st, it's too fast to see anything, 2nd it only shows 3, 3rd, it doesn't take you to that point in your album so you could actually look @ your pics. Also, the business of being alerted that your pictures are being altered without your consent by the app is exceptionally disturbing and bothersome. My pics are mine to alter not yours! Leave them alone!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Google Photos seems capable on the surface. However, files within different folders act as if they are linked often. For example, if I download an item and then move it to a folder, it still appears in both. Worse, deleting it from either folder deletes it from both. Forced to use a file manager to delete it from undesired location. Google photos also seems to have trouble moving items frequently. Similar workaround required. It also loses PC copied items. It's the dumbest smart app I use... üôÑ"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The usefulness has recently diminished as some os are no longer supported. I used to use this all the time but with the changes it's more trouble than it's worth. If you have a device that is recent then it's more like a 4 star experience. There's an option to make collages but you can't choose what goes where. Very frustrating. I'll try this app again when I can afford to get a new device.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The latest release is terrible! They messed up a perfect app. Everything is now so much harder to do, and requires more clicks and scrolling. I normally edit most of my photos, adjust lighting, blue level and other. It now requires much more time using their stupid new interface. Also, as many other users have reported, the phone vibrates like crazy(on Samsun Galaxy) for each button you press in the app, and disregards the system vibration settings. I is so bad, I uninstalled it, and got an old version APK. But, even with the old version, and all auto updates disabled, each time I start the app it pops up a crappy ""Update Now"" message!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love the concept, but the albums functionality is sort of precarious (only a pointer to the original, not real segregation) and buggy (mainly when selecting multiple photos), which makes it hard to manage. Also the image recognition algorithm seems pretty ok on photos, which doesn't get to my mind why it doesn't have a feature to point out and remove duplicates. I use it a lot because I need to and because of the sync, but it's very laborious to find anything there."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"terrible update, l uninstalled and put back to basic version. not much point in having all your photos uploaded anyway, might as well just back them up on other storage devices. at least that way theres little chance of them disapearing or being deleted. l think all these updates are just a way evenually to make you pay. what wrong with basic photo apps. with gallery folders. that you can name and date."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Hello, used to be really good but has gone way downhill. Never used to take pictures which ended up upside down, with no way to rotate them to be right side up! The original app when I got my first phone allowed you to rotate the pictures for different times to do them upside down sideways in each direction etc. What happened to that feature? Additionally if you're too close or too far away taking a picture of a piece of paper or document, it will also turn the picture upside down..."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've never reviewed apps before, but Google Photos was so frustrating I felt obligated to put this here. It takes way too long to recognize photos/videos on your phone and there is no easy way to add files into an album. After you get the photos you want into an album, it does not organize them the same way you put them in; even after you sort them out it will reset and put them wherever it wants. Granted this happens when it seemingly can't connect to Google services, which is ALL the TIME."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great! love the google assistant feature! Needs a few more tweaks for the dog recognise system; but everything is fantastic, as you can create folders or your google assistant will do it for you. love the faces section as it compares and places photos with that face! Amazing! The technology can only get better. When conecting phone to phone or laptop... I would say that works perfectly. This app is optimised to perform at it's best!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I absolutely hate how complicated they made such a simple concept app...all these folders has edited pictures be lost ... I keep editing pics with the editor from the app and the picture will be gone. As if there was no folder for edited pictures. It's a nightmare. PLEASE go back to the basics. One simple folder that contains ALL pictures from ANY source... PLEASE
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Editing problem - now everytime you want to.efit a photo their are several confusing sub-menus. It saves the image as a copy. This used to be an option. Now masses of storage used saving an image twice! Also won't allow you to make changes in certain portrait modes. When you attempt to save it comes up with an error message. Much worse than the previous incarnation.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Im so over this app. I first thought it was great to back up photos and categorize people, but there is no way to print them and the app is not compatible with any printing service in nz/australia. And if it is it only shows up about 3 photos in a folder of like 300! Especially the folders that have literally taken me years to organise. Im going to ditch it and go back to the old school upload to a usb and print from there. So much easier."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Nice app. I love creating folders of my pictures I've saved for convenience. Only things that really bother me is some being saved under different dates for no reason & I have to scroll through thousands of pictures just to find it; & by then I forgot the date to move it with the others. Also I have this empty, unnamed folder that refuses to delete & load. If these are fixed that would be great. Also, it'd be nice to delete pictures while in folders I created cause I find duplicates easier there"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Was good until last updates, now all my stored photos are tiled in a weird way that I can't seem to stop and get back to the nice little square thumbnails i had before. Help please! Thanks for the response on 7-2-22 but none of that - nor more recent updates - have improved the situation. What I want is very simple and is a return to how things were some three weeks ago. Putting it quite simply, when I open the app, I want to see equal sized thumbnails of my most recent images. I do NOT want to see images of all different sizes - especially when this affects the number visible on the first 'page'. I do NOT want to have to mess about looking in libraries or whatever to see thumbnails. Hopefully you will fix this or at least have it as an option?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Honestly the worst photo storage solution I've ever encountered in my entire life. It does everything opposite of how I want it. Also, it's more or less impossible to export a large number of photos from this app. Google is clearly more interested in keeping you trapped within their own system than in providing a useful service. Absolutely awful app!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The assistant is great on my Pixel phone, all pictures and videos go into Google drive with unlimited storage. It automatically creates albums of trips, walks, holidays or events. Search for people, places and more. It also often provides short videos of your trips with background music or offers to enhance single pictures by adding effects. Sharing the albums or videos is also easy."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like the functions for still photo editing but it is very difficult to make a movie from video clips. Every time I have tried to make a movie thus far, the app ask me if I want to save the movie and I press save and nothing seems to happen except the little twirly thing going for a few seconds and then disappearing. I can't find the movie anywhere."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Really happy with this app, quick and efficient. I can transfer images and videos from my mobile to my PC in a matter of moments. The app indicates when files have been uploaded and prompts the removal of offline files. This is great as it allows one to better manage their offline storage. With automatic uploads the cloud is always up to date, granted the linked devices are synced and there is a network connection. Google Photos can recognise specific features and group the photos in an album."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I used to love this app, however the update you guys did on the 6/21/21 has messed it up. I've been using this app for a long time and never had an issue until now. It half works now. My photo's back but the free up space no longer works. I can hit it several times and nothing. I wait in between times still nothing. I've restarted my phone several times. Uninstalled the app several times etc.. I even contacted support and nothing. This is extremely frustrating and disappointing."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"They want you to use their machine learning to be able to sort and filter your images, but they don't let you help train it by manually tagging photos. Two of my tabby cat's have been mistakenly identified as the same cat, but I can't correct it. Yet more of Google's arrogance that they are doing nothing wrong, and not actually meeting the needs of their customers. It picks the worst photos to ""enhance"" and the enhancement always looks horrible with chromatic blue distortions."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app! It stores all your pictures from many devises with your email on them, You can identify people and search for them in app (the facial recognition software is very clever) and you can make shared albums, collages, media links share media in chats, great+helpful notifications, stores pictures and doesn't deplete their quality and many other great things. This app saved my pictures multiple times after a previous device died. Too bad the free space runs out fast before having to buy it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app! Best place to store photos since Photobucket! The only cruddy part is if your account gets hacked, they have access to your old photos & videos. Also, since I forgot my password on a few accounts & don't have the same numbers anymore, I lost a lot of memories.): I wouldn't mind, but the pictures of my babies... Gone forever. I don't see how with all this ai technology, they can't just compare your photos and info to help you regain access. I make a new account with every new phone..."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good for organizing photos into albums and finding them by various methods. The biggest issue is that there is no way to find out if you forgot to place a photo in an album. If you did, it will get lost in your main feed and won't be able to find it later. Such a basic feature yet Google doesn't seem realize it's a problem for many. OK app if you have a small to medium collection, otherwise find something else where your photos won't get ""lost"" if you forget to put them in an album."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Albums consistently show the incorrect thumbnail or none at all. Tried everything, no luck. A Google search shows people complaining about this for years. It seems nitpicky considering everything this app can do, but if an image manager cannot display the correct images, then that's pretty deal-breaking. It feels harsh, but it's going to have to be two stars (one extra for all the cool features) until the app can perform its primary function correctly."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google Photos is a great app for storing and organizing your photos. It has a lot of features, but one thing that would make it even better is a drag-to-rotate feature. This would make it much easier to rotate photos, especially if you are trying to rotate multiple photos at once. I hope that Google will add this feature in the future. This apps updates going to be a pain when you never includes any extra new features but send updates timely..... ""additionally increase the apps size"""
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very good, unless it decides to behave like a spoilt kid. Anyway it teaches you a lot of patience. Once it does that being spoilt, it can create a lot of problems like not at all updating photos using any type of data. Sometimes it latches on this wanting to use only mobile data, else it will always wait for WiFi even if you're connected to WiFi. Or it will just keep telling you that it is getting ready for backup. And in these cases, it will drain your battery like nobody's business."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I loved this app for the past three years I've had it. As someone who has a habit of taking a lot of pictures and videos, the idea of an app with free, unlimited storage that cleaned out my phone for me was amazing. Now that that's going away, I might switch to an alternative in June. I understand that it's hard to keep any app up for free, but maybe instead of getting rid of unlimited storage, you could add some ads to the app in order to make money off of it? Just throwing out a suggestion. Nonetheless, your app has served me well for three years, and I hope you take some of mine and other reviewers' suggestions. Thanks!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is great, I've never had problems... Until now. Whenever I delete a photo from my gallery, it makes one from a day forward go back into the day I just deleted one from, so if I deleted one picture from February 1st, a photo from February 2nd would go down one, under the label of February 1st. It's really annoying and idk how to stop this or fix it. Please help me!! Edit: I don't know if this is helpful, but on Google Files, my photos are all in order of date, so it's fine there."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"this app is really great! speacialy for pixel user it gives unlimited storage for full resolution back up. the only thing that i want for the developers to add is that it gives us a notification about a photo that was captured a year ago so we can look back at it and remember that time, just like a function on facebook that we can look back from a post a year ago. i think this is essential since we are uploading our photos wich serves as a memory of an event that we dont want to forget. ‚ô•Ô∏è"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Not a good experience. I had to upload some picture to google photos in an Album. I selected photos,created the album and started the upload. But then i realized i was on cellular data, i wanted to pause or stop the upload that was being started but could find any way to do it.Its Frustrating as a user to not given control to stop the upload. I am still currently facing the issue and having the worst experience using these google app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The ability to group people's photos is a great feature. It suggests different versions of people as they age to match up. I enjoy that function often. Especially the looking back. It shows my little one from present day compared to a random year same day. It's great to see how she's grown. The reason for one less star is some large group photos school/out and about will group a random. The other feature I'm not a fan of at times is the years in review. Some memories I don't want to have pop up.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Like that it backs up photos automatically, saves space and keeps things organized. Wish you could separate videos & photos in terms of upload quality and whether videos are automatically deleted when cleaning up, as the video quality is always destroyed by GP. It also glitches a lot. Have to comb through to update time zones, & re-select hundreds of photos to add to shared albums after (a) being told after the fact of max 500 photos & (b) the app glitched out & deslected all."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Looks.like.im in the same boat as alot of people. Can't get the app to update. It says a different date that it was last updated every time I open it. And I can't proceed without updating. It's very frustrating. I was at a once in a lifetime event this weekend, and I'm out of storage. So couldnt take as many y photos and videos as I would have liked. Also, I have 6 grandchildren, all small, pictures are very important right now! They are our memories! Fix this please!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,A great app. My mom accidentally deleted all the photos and videos on my gallery. I was so disappointed because that folder contains the videos I took during my favorite singer's concert. I thought I will not be able to retrieve them but thanks to google photos all my videos and photos are saved there so I retrieved the deleted items there.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I would love the app if it allows me to hide content and lock it from. Next, please make the albums organisable, in example, the albums can be rearranged however i want to. Another one would be, please let me add any photos to favourites, right now it only allows me to add photos from ""camera"" to favourites, photos from any other folders doesn't have the option. Please make some changes, because these features were available on my previous iPhone but not on my pixel so it is a major turn off"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Something that I've never liked about this app is when I go to backup my photo albums from my device, they're all lumped into one whole group, forcing me to have to reorganize them back into album again. A good addition to make would be to keep the photos in their original albums when backedup, when backing up whole albums, so I'm not forced into having to reorganize them to my liking again. Please backup actual photo albums, and not just the photos in the albums."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely fantastic the A.I. power of this app makes it so useful! I love how it automatically sorts all your photos, labelling them without you having to do anything. With the thousands of photos I've taken I need a tool like this. It's also really great for sharing, I frequently create shared albums and add people to them after we've been on holiday together."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Searching by a date is very difficult, shows a bunch of random photos and it doesn't even show photos from 3 years ago sometimes (or even other years after). I searched for Oct 3, and the 2016 photos didn't show up, but I still got a memories circle showing the picture from that day, so I had to scroll all the way down just to see it. Even indexing again doesn't change the clustered search function, please improve this based on the date not filenames."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Google photos. I have a Google phone which I've needed to replace for some time as some aspects are broken but the camera is the reason why I haven't. Of course it's not as good as a 35ml camera, but it's great. Lovely colours, sharp, good night shots, pretty good zoom function, good video, good edit options. I've really enjoyed it, and I take a lot of photos, but also make books and post them too. So for the price of the Google phone, it and Google photos have served me well"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love the backup feature. Just started trying out the assistant feature and can say that I have yet to see any other cloud based photo app have that. It is a really fun feature to use and love how it can automatically turn pictures into collages, animation scenes from still shots, and even make a movie with videos you have taken yourself and compile everything in a way where the pictures are relevant to each other especially when you have over a couple TB of memories."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app for backing up your precious, adorable moments of life, without losing it. Pretty much easy to use, GUI is user friendly and the overall design of the app is appealing. Updates are frequent but not too much exasperating, and thus keeps the app free of bugs and glitches. Worth using it, give it a try as it offers 15 Gb of free storage!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Extremely frustrating! Backing up photos is a joke. It can't find half my folders on my phone and then mixes all the folders all together. There's no daily or weekly backup options - I don't need every single screenshot backed up, but as soon as I take it, it gets backed up in Google before I get a chance to send and then delete it from my device. All to be told my storage has run out, buy more now! It's a great way to push people into paying for services they don't actually need. Great job üëè"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Recently changed phones, Google photo won't sync with google1, can't retrieve photos despite paying for the service, spent three hours online with a 'google expert' who basically told me to turn it off and turn it on again, very reminiscent of the it crowd. Still can't access photos or back up my phone, he ended the session saying let's just leave it for a day and see what happens."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,For the most part I really enjoy this app and will probably pay for more space when the time comes up. However with that said the most frustrating thing is the fact that it doesn't keep their folder structure from your local device. I'm sure a lot of people have their photos organized on their phone but when they upload to Google photos it's all lost.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I don't use of loud, I don't open my gallery.. I only deal with Google photos bevause I know all my pivtured are safe, backed up, private,,and secure. Who needs an SD card or any memory card for a cell phone when you have googke photos. It has so many awesome features, (face recognition, editing, assistance, ECT.) And always delivers. I have it as default for any picture storage related apps. It's decently my favorite Google feature."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been messing with this from a week but now I just found and fixed it. Its a bug inside the app that if you put anything in trash and them somehow the containing folder gets deleted and you hence its not in sync with the Photos anymore, you won't be able to recover that back. To do so you need to create the same folder at the same path again to restore it else it would keep on saying that its been restored but you won't see that in your storage or photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is by far the best app out there for photos. I love the back up and delete feature that's less I have to do. Archive is great. Not only do I get to save my pictures and make room for more, i can choose to turn off all options anytime i need to. The utility features are great. I'm always making movies from my pictures and I get everything all in one spot. Definitely recommend."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been backing up my photos and videos in Google photos since 2019. I've been satisfied with it's progress until this week. I noticed that Google Photos won't back up my videos. I decided to remove my account then add it again, I also cleared the cache and uninstalled it multiple times but it just became worse. Now, it just keep on saying ""setting up your photo library"" and ""getting ready to back up"" for hours. Some of my photos and videos are also gone. Pls fix this."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've enjoyed Google photos for years but lately it's acting pretty strange. For instance, it seems as if my photos and videos are not backing up correctly. It will take a very long time to back up and it sometimes won't upload videos. I am frequently checking to see if I can clear up any space but it only has a few mb that it says are safe to delete from device. Also, I could swear to God that somehow, many of my pictures are being edited/double exposure or whatever it's called."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's FREE! Until it's not. They are taking away free storage. The cloud backup of photos was magnificent, then they replaced it with compression riddled photo backup, and next June all the free goes away. Not to mention they never bothered fixing their movie making feature, which still wastes hours of your time before refusing to save your work. They happily collected all our data in exchange for free photo storage and since we all got hooked they start charging for it next June. Yikes."

New pictures taken don't show up in the camera folder. 3. Albums can't be deleted. 4. Photos can't be archived. 5. Very slow and buggy. 6. Device folders that get deleted still show up in google photos. 7. People's names can't be edited. 8. People's face can't be hidden. 9.Lots of constant unending loading screens everywhere, for ex: clicking the edit icon."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's an indisputable must-have tool, with much-needed design and modification features. In my point of view, adding to the application an automatic file compressor that converts the content into zipp and that at the same time can easily decompress each album, making excess storage not a problem for the operation of the device or from account. So instead of charging a storage service that has reached its limit, you could charge"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google photos allow you to take personal photos like a hairstyle change, a picture of your dog, or photos that simply make you laugh. Photos and videos that you can go back to later with options to share with others. Capture cool moments of outfits, or in a costume, or during holidays capture great memories together with friends and family. You can change picture modes and even cut off ,and crop or filter out parts of the picture. Everyone is using Google photos because it's is just that easy."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The ""download album"" button isn't protected by a confirmation notification and it appears where the comments button starts out after a delay, so I've downloaded an entire album of several thousand pictures 3 times now, and there is no undo of this action. I deleted the photos by hand using the help advice online, but it didn't delete them from the phone app and there's no way to do that that I have found. This is simple and basic functionality Google has failed to address."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Ok. This thing is amazing. The software is very clean and friendly and I can't help but check if the Google lens can detect what I took a photo of each time. It really helps keep your photo's clean and the movies, collages, stylised photos and other creations it makes are fantastic. Editing images has never been this easy. Truly 10/10, 100% and just perfect. Highly recommend."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's impossible to organize photos into separate galleries. ive only had this issue since switching from Samsung to Google Pixel and im really disappointed honestly. I've been making due with what I have for a while, but a bunch of photos r being corrupted because of album transfer and I can't access the photos to know what I've lost. Backup is great and all, but I'd like to have an organized gallery."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Alot of expectations from this app, im trusting it with being my only backup for every valuable shot on my phone. Easy to use and easy to find shots by searching for faces, locations or even settings. I just wish the folders/albums on my phone were backed up as they are to photos. It's impractical that i have to backup and then rearrange them again as folders inside photos. Hope this gets fixed in a new update. Sometimes the video's won't load on the app even with fast internet connection."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"One big flaw for this app. When I have the setting on to backup all of my photos and videos, I would expect it to automatically do so. But it will only backup files (mostly videos) if I have the app open and active. It will stop uploading if the screen goes dark or if I go to another app. I have to spend hours waiting for it to upload my camera roll, constantly waking up the screen. I have also lost videos that should have been backed up and I deleted off my phone before double checking."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Wow, updating from 4.46 to 5.0 I didn't realise how shithouse the new experience had become. Rolling back to 4.46 was better but I uninstalled and was left with the default system version that was came with the OS ‚Äì v3.25 and I so easily had access to what was really important; photos, albums, assistant and sharing. Albums shows me photos on this device straight up and I can use this app as the default gallery. I don't need Instagram style recent highlights and having simple functions hidden."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Aside from the sync/share/backup features, this app is hot garbage. Photos are sorted by date taken, even after being edited. Just edit a nice pic from earlier this year? Good luck finding where the edited copy saved. Want to favorite a photo? Maybe you can do that if you're viewing it under the right context, otherwise that button is mia. Inconsistent, unorganized, and generally confusing. Only a full UI overhaul could redeem this abomination."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's mediocre at best. It's nice that you can search for specific things in an image, but the app is barely functional, so that function is useless. The markup tool is completely broken and it ruins my photos with glitching, so I had to get another app for that. The new editing set up in general sucks compared to what it was before. It's clunky, and it's constantly buffering and freezing too. Overall, it has a few nice features, but you can't even use most of them because the app is so broken."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app used to provide backup and deleting a photo in it would not delete the original copy. I'm not sure when that transition happened but I must have lost files I didn't intend to during it, and the versatility of the tool is diminished. The fact that I don't know when the transition happened is a significant issue."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"UPDATE: Found an obscure menu that let me delete a photo that was ""stuck"" in upload (for weeks on end without a prompt to fix it). Once I did that, all of my problems resolved. Wish there had been a more helpful error message. The app was ""uploading"" the same photo for over 2 months, and syncing with shared albums and my cloud storage wasn't working as expected."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like photos and previously would give the App 5 stars. Why does it take forever to save after using the new enhance function. The redone edit menu is nice, but the old one was fine. If I have to wait 5 min for the changes to be saved, it ruins the experience. Please have your updates tested on a variety of old and new phones to be sure you do not mess up basic functions."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I have been used this app for more than three years. It was a very good app. But I was find some photos were missing in camera. I have make sure I took the photos and can't find it back eventhough from cloud. Also I can't find some sets of photos were took two years ago was uploaded to cloud. I have very upset & disappointed. Could you please fixing it. Thanks.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been reluctant to use a cloud service to back up photos/videos because I didn't want to end up with an unorganized pile-up unless I used a clunky web interface to clear the clutter. When I saw the Google Photos app on my niece's phone and its effectiveness, I decided to try it. It was worth it. If I delete photos on my phone, they can be resorted for up to 60 days. Accessing the photos/videos from a PC via a browser is hassle-free. The web interface works great in all browser I use."

I tried but couldn't manually transfer neither Media or contacts to my new phone.

Thank you GOOGLE for backing us up in such a wonderful way!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"As a gallery, this app is pretty poor. For a start, the photos stream contains everything. We should be able to hide files as organised folders, not just dump everything into another stream called archive. You also cannot use commands like archive when viewing a device folder, nor can you organise the main photo stream by folder or any other criteria."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Suggestion. Is there any way to add the ability to find similar or duplicate images? Maybe we could enable google lens to identify other photos in our library that are similar. For some reason, I'm finding the same image multiplied throughout my library with many different dates, making it very hard to manually go through and find them all to delete. This option would be a game changer!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app. My google pixel phone takes great pics and the app store then all on great quality. Plenty of storage space that's free, up until you use it. Then you have to pay for storage. All the folder options and quick view options for a certain image in your library: faces, places, cars, etc.. you can easily make a photo book and add caution or edit, then when complete you can purchase your photo book right from Google delivered wherever. You can make movies with your videos and plenty more."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Latest updates rendered the common task of cropping non-intuitive to unusable. The cropping tool has been buried deeply as an ""extension"" that must be added--and the only one apparently available. The cropping is only of each corner independently. Aligned vertical or horizontal cropping does not appear to be available. This is a deal breaker for the built in photo capabilities of the pixel."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Latest update is useless. I cannot access any of my photos without the app crashing. Uninstalling update. Can't access photos at all. It worked just fine yesterday and now it won't open. What happened? I cannot access any photos after July of this year because they no longer sync with Google drive. Where are my photos? Why won't you respond to my repeated requests for help? Not to mention it no longer automatically backs up photos.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really like it and would rate it higher except that it is ridiculous that I can not fix mistakes made in facial grouping or that you can but it is ridiculous complicated and I have to spend this much time trying to figure it out rather than having a simple ""tag face"" or fix option or literally anything. I love being able to search by the persons face but it consistently mixes faces up or leaves out multiple people and there is no easy way to fix it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Why doesn't this app have the ability to Edit photos?? Like, let me mark on a screenshot a circle or something. I can only edit if I open another app. another thing- when I DOWNLOAD photos, instead of my photo being accessible from Google Photos, where it doesn't show up- I have to go to my Device Downloads folder and somehow move/save the photo in my Google Photos album. Takes too long and not always successful. Getting a screenshot is faster. I don't always want to do that"

I recently moved some photos and videos from Google Photos to the locked folder in Google Photos. Everything from 2014-2022 is now missing!!! I haven't cleared any data or cache, nor have I uninstalled the app. I had backup turned on as well. Google support, please help restore my Google Photos. Locked Folder is not operating as expected.

I preferred when my photos all stayed together in the order I took them. Now when I upload photos to a selling app I use for business I have to remember to check the ""PhotosEditor"" album for any related pictures. Very time consuming and annoying. Also I can delete a picture, empty it from the bin and still it will show up again when I go to upload other photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's a mess. I switched from samsung to google photos and even the recent photos I took with the phone are a mess. They don't appear anywhere and old videos are popping up on top of the gallery. It's impossible to post on facebook or send pictures to anyone because you just never able to locate them. I tried to create a separate folder but that only appears on Google photos and other apps not able to locate them. It's honestly a nightmare.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm using it. But...Need to be able to reverse alphabetize the album names. Finding photos is a royal pain. There needs to be an easy way to see in photos which albums the same photo is included in. And an easy way to find photos that are not in any album would be useful. I dislike that I can't add captions to multiple photos at the same time. Nor correct spellings or punctuation in one step. In short, I need access to the database behind the phot storage. Differs on 3 different platforms"

You go back a month later and your app memory is almost full again. Google.... why dont you make a simple dashboard in the app that allows us to control everything..... what we want to save or delete without pulling teeth? I dont have time to go to this page and that, and this and that process. This kind of stuff is what brings apple as a potential competition to begin with."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Google photos is super nice! You can upload pictures from your phone super easily and it saves so much storage on your phone. It also is very convenient because you can access your photos from any device with internet access. Also makes sending photos to others very convenient cause you do not have to worry about the quality being messed up if you are sending it to someone who has a different phone type then you.

There are cumbersome things you can do to get around that, but once you put them on their cloud it seems you no longer own them. You NEED to give us the option to remove from Google Photos, but not from the device!!! Amazon Photos gives us that option!!! And for a small fee you get unlimited photo and video storage too!!"

They just kinda disappeared out of thin air. It's pretty straight forward other than that though.

Recording is legal in all cases in many countries, in some cases in other countries (for example with authorization from both parties), and in any case it's not really Google's problem if what I do is legal or not since the phone is mine. Whenever I talked to any service that warned me that the call could/would be recorded I would also record it myself. Now I can't do that anymore"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Hello guys great app but there's just one flaw for me. It is impossible to access the albums I create whenever I want to select a picture from that album. I'll need to go through the long process of trying to remember which I saved the picture and that's not good for me. If there is a way you can allow albums saved on web to integrate with device folders that would be a huge plus. Think about it. Thank you.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible, the app is designed in a way that you have to upload your data to google drive. The library section is really poorly designed no option for customization, custom sort, changing the size of the photos. The photos on device section also is really limited, you cannot change the sort of the folder niether their view size. And it is also really hard to navigate to. All of the options I just mentioned were easily accesible through samsung gallery app which I used before."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app is great The features are easy to work through. It's a great tool to have all your photos in one place and edit as you wish between devices. I have a Google Pixel however my account tells me I am full. Would be nice if those of us that contribute to Google maps and such would receive extra storage at no cost. The app is great but if you're limited with storage it's not helpful
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a very useful app for backup and never losing pictures but i will give only 3 stars because there are so many useful features missing, for example: I can't tell which photos are backed up and which aren't because it will always show me photos on my device, another huge problem for me is that there is only one option to free up space on my storage which is delete all photos that were backed up! Why can't I choose which original photos I want to delete? Please help with this."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This has been my favorite photo app since I got the Pixel 1. However, recently one of my favorite features - face grouping - has been broken with no fix. When faces are removed, they come back, and some assigned tags disappear and I have to add the tags back. The only suggestion to fix it is to turn off grouping and turn it back on - which didn't fix the issue and just forced me to completely start over. I take photos for clients and not having this makes work difficult. I hope this gets fixed."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's not bad, it's just that it's really irritating to have them always wanting to buy more storage, they offer any option that will make you pay, and that's a true pain in the üçë. Then, there's the fact that sometimes, I would like to simply be able to rotate the image without having to edit it. I would also like a better UI, it's hard to navigate through this app, when I finally get used to the new and confusing interface, they change, they LOVE changing the app, switching key elements.notcool"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Update 01/2020- getting much better, bumped up a star. LOVE Google photos, and it's fantastic when it works. Problem is, the app only works about half the time. Doesn't hide photos you ask it to hide, won't add names to photos you ask it to, locks up, refuses to manifest the keyboard when you need to enter text, and so on. Really wish it would work, because the concept is super useful."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"February 27,2021: App worked fine, until it refused to let me do anything without updating. Updated and it lost the sort and albums I had, with no way to redo it again. I guess wanting a way to just sort and view photos was asking too much. Guess I'll have to look for another app for this. Few updates later March 10, 2021: inconvenient to do any sort, and still not like it was in early February."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is a great app. Sometimes they will create movies out of videos and photos you have on there. The editing is basic but is still better than editing through the camera app that is built into the phone. Google photos doesn't sync with Google Drive anymore. Which really makes it a pain. Because without dealing with a mess, you have to choose between having your photos on Google drive or Google photos. You have to transfer them manually otherwise. You can access the photos on the website though"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I find myself opening up the app to look at my images less and less these days because the updates keep getting worse and worse. My image folders are losing more and more images with each new update. Now I can only view images I've taken in the last couple of months in my folders. I've also lost some folders that I know for sure I've backed up and saved. Please fix these issues and let me view my image folders in their entirety instead of sending me a useless link.

There is only one thing that really bothers me about with this app at the moment, and that is creating a long list of favorites.

Since the most recent update (Oct 2020), when organizing and deleting photos, it constantly stops (crashes). I don't have an Android 11 OS so I don't know if that would cause the problem or not. I rely heavily upon this app and hope Googe will figure out what the issue is and fix it. Very odd that it's happening with this particular application. Thank you.

So thank you Google for being a piece of junk again. OH! And it enabled Google assistant which I certainly didn't want automatically. I don't even want assistant on my phone."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is just a horrible, useless system. You can take photos but you can't access them. I hate it when my camera's battery dies.

Not everyone wants to live in the cloud!!! Now I can't even submit this review since I have not reached 100 words. I hope that someone who can read at Google sends a reply as to how to obtain my photos."

Unfortunately, the app fails randomly to do the simplest tasks such as moving an image to a different local directory or to edit a locally stored image for no rational reason whatsoever. This has been the case for many years now and is worse than ever in 2023. For a company with the talent and engineering power of Google, I find this inexcusable."

The UI gives no confidence as to which items are sync and when they are/will be synced, newly created albums are not seen from the web app, there is no on-demand sync feature per album, not clear why I have to have Backup on, in order to have the photos synced. Also, with Backup on, why is the app not recognizing when I upload the same photo for a second time?! Horrible. And the home page is in 1/3 consumed by useless tiles."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hot take incoming - This tech company Google, makes good products for my life and needs. I really like having everything synced up amongst them. I think there are always features that could be cooler, or some of the UI might be improved in some ways. Ultimately I need my products to work consistently, and do what I expect them to do. Photos does that for me 100%. And IMO every UI that's ever been created, has been one's favorite thing, and another's worst ever. Not a factor for my rating."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My photos app shouldn't advertise photo-related products that it wants to sell me. The photos app should be a basic utility of a phone. Not another opportunity for Google to get more money from me. And it's not intuitive. There's no one place to easily see all images on your phone, it's all divided up into album's based on apps, file type, screenshot, camera, etc. Which is fine, but that's the only way to see it. You can't look at all pictures on your phone regardless of type."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,A recent update has made it more difficult to do some editing including reorienting a photo. The editing is extremely limited. It will not allow one to reorient a photo when it is saved in vertical format rather than horizontal as it was taken by the camera. Bring back the previous editing capability. Why is it that I can only get the correct orientation in the vertical format? I cannot reorient the photos to the correct view. I just took two photos and I the app theyr were UPSIDE DOWN.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app doesn't work properly with the new file management in Android. Anything in your DCIM folder on the SD card is automatically backed up, which includes all albums created from the photos app on the device, without being able to choose which ones to back up. To circumvent this, you need to create folders OUTSIDE of DCIM, then you can manage which ones to back up and which ones not."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The best value and experience for any photo app available. I have over 100,000 pictures in Google Photos, and I can access any of them from my phone as if they were local because of the cloud sync. Love love love this app. Oh.. and Google search inside of Google photos??!!!?!!! The ability to just search for two people's names with an and between them and the word red truck. Completely awesome! I can describe a scene stick a couple of people's names in it and it instantly finds it in 100k pics"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This used to be my go-to photo app. Since the new update, it doesn't open. Force closes within 10 seconds. Sadly, I can't even open enough to share photos with others. If this keeps up, I guess we'll all have to switch to Amazon photos. Fewer options, but at least it opens. Edited: 10/27/2019: Still force close within 3 seconds of opening. Still can't use it. Extremely disappointed in Google for this, but it's Google, so it's not likely that they're going to actually fix the problem."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's worthless. It deletes things it shouldn't, and lumps all of your photos into folders by date, so you can't tell which ones are on your phone and which ones are uploaded to drive. It also backs up my photos when I have that feature turned off, but only random photos on occasion. *UPDATE* The canned response from the ""creator"" doesn't help at all. I shouldn't have to read a manual to use an app. A Google app should NEVER LUMP ALL OF MY PICTURES TOGETHER BY DATE INSTEAD OF STORAGE LOCATION!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My photos keep disappearing from the gallery after backup. Edit: Thank you for responding. I keep creating separate folder for personal use and they disappear after some time. Example: I turned on auto backup. I creted a folder X. After 6 months - that folder is gone. I can see the photos I had there in my Google Drive, but not on my phone anymore. I definitely did not delete them from my phone. The same happens with auto created folders like Instagram downloades, Messenger and etc."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"the free up space option NEEDS to have a undo option. also when you restore the photos, the dates are not according to when you took it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app doesn't work well. I am starting to move away from it. I can't move pictures to a folder easily. After I move a bunch of pictures, it tells me ""0 pictures added"". Sometimes it adds the pictures to a folder and then removes them later. If I create a folder out of lots of pictures (say 300 or 800), the folder doesn't open and keeps saying "" loading photos"". It also doesn't follow the way you organize your photoes on your mobile. And it deletes them unless you specifically disable it"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What happened to the google Lens support? Bring it back! While reading the reviews here, one thing is clear. The reviewers don't collaborate with other Google departments and just point the users to the FAQ and app Forum. It's even worse if you realize that you cannot click on the link from their comments!!! Google being the phone maker, app maker and app store maker should be doing better than this!!! Broken experience from end to end!!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I don't use Google Photos so look at and organize my photos. The only thing I use this app for is the image editor, and it's great. Cropping is full featured. You can edit loads of visual effects from saturation, to color temperature, to even the black level of shadows. There's also markup, highlighting, and text (which are pretty standard). It's no PC ver of Photoshop, but if you need to edit an image on the go, this is better than any other photos app I've used."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I'm impressed! I complained to Google Support that I had a photo always trying to upload but never making it. This caused it to always say there was one photo preparing for backup. Fortunately a recent update has a feature where if you click on the message that says there are photos uploading it will show you which ones! I found the offending photo which was messed up and deleted it. Now the backup is complete! Thanks!!! I still wish I could request a panorama of pics of my choosing... Wishing!

With this last update to fix save changes feature, now, after editing when you hit done, it comes up instead of save, it says save copy... Ok, I don't want to save copy, that used to be a feature you could choose, and I did occasionally. No, your only choice is "" save copy"" ... Ok, but it doesn't work. It says "" unable to save changes"" and it spins and spins!!!!!!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I find Google Photos really helpful in searching for a specific photo. It automatically sort photos into albums according to people, animals, things, activities and places. Plus, having unlimited cloud storage, I still find photos I took 5 years ago. No need to back them up on my own computer to free up phone space. My photos and videos are always available when I need them."

And I can no longer find thousands of them. This is going to be a big time wasting mess! Don't do it! One other problem... now that the photos have disappeared from my device I cannot even retrieve them when I'm trying to attach them to messages or any other app. This is extremely frustrating and I wish they would just allow me to undo those changes."

I enjoy the consistent design and experience across different platforms as well. I also love great bundled utilities like being able to make a short movie and being able to do quick editing. Apart from all this, photo editing is top-notch with features like magic eraser."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Google photos does a great job reminding you of life's moments. Lately, I find that it's a very painful experience uploading & adding pictures and videos to an album. The notification area shows a message like: ""Uploading 12 items. Using 1.8 GB of cellular data"". The pictures do not upload, it just shows an initialisation status bar that does not change does not progress. All other tasks that require data are waiting but, for some reason, Google photos is not upload and isn't saying why."

I have tried several photo storage apps over the years but this is by far the best."

However, I have yet to figure out how to save them (intentionally, I managed to save one but I'm not sure how) and I've had even less success sharing with someone on an iPhone.

Edit: I looked at the page and I do as it says, but let's say I have 3 folders on my phone ""Landscapes"", ""Indoors"", and ""Friends"" and I only activate the Friends folder. It still backing up photos from landscapes and Indoors. By the way, thanks for the quick answer."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app basically has a stroke whenever I try to move pictures between folders. Sometimes they all get moved immediately, but more often than not some or all of the images I select stay put for multiple minutes at a time and I can't do anything with them until the app eventually catches up, even if I restart the app and clear its cache. Using any run-of-the-mill file explorer lets me do it without issue, so I don't get why the Google-developed app for my Google-powered phone has such issues."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"First I would like to say. I am a huge fan of google. that being said, the application just sucks. they have this assistant that doesn't assist...at all. maybe once a month I will have a new animation or memory.

Once they're there, it's NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO PUT THEM BACK ON MY PHONE. I use a lot of visuals for my work. It's incredibly infuriating to have them constantly removed from my phone, and put in with all the unorganized, difficult to sift through photos that have been backed up 4evr."

On iPhone it worked and all photos were uploaded. On android, I can't even load the photos from the iPhone and when downloading anything it would just say video still being processed. Now there is a notification that one item is being uploaded, but the progress bar does not move. It has been more than 30 minutes."

I am impressed especially with how intuitive it is with facial recognition and the classification of many things like ""sky"" pics or ""poster"", an overall totally worth it app. I got it thinking it would waste my time and data, but I've had it for a while now and don't plan on removing it. Very handy for long-term storage. Get it yall"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The auto backup and storage is the sell. The UI is clumsy and directionless. Search is basic and there are no obvious routes to access the videos, collections nor gifs they often make. It seems we have to wait and hope it happens. I feel giving to the tech employed in Lens alone that there ought to be significantly more tools on hand. I do enjoy the phot editing element. I'm a complete layman and have found success easily enough. I'm confident it can improve."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm having trouble with the feature of only 15gb per account. I'm running low of storage in my account, that's why I'm forced to turn off my back up to my account. I suggest that this is a very boring feature, and people will start avoiding this app because of only 15gb. I suggest to enlarge the storage to minimum 30gb per account."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Three reasons for the 3-star rating (because otherwise it's seamless and easy): 1. Default to date of media capture for your library -- when you have vast media and upload an old one it gets lost in the shuffle... Tough to find. 2. The movie maker (+ movie) default trims clips for you and inserts random music -- when you have 40 clips and have to go to each individually to 'use entire clip' it becomes tedious *very* quickly. 3. App freeze during editing -- I curse at Google too often for this.

Some photos you take won't show up in the photos app until you connect to the internet. This app is getting worse and worse unfortunately."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Better than ok but with problems that are unforgivable if you're Google. Examples: if you're working on creating animations, the app will pick a random image a few dozen before or after the one you're working on and jump back to it over and over, interrupting what you're doing. Restarting app doesn't help. Also the make space option either deletes all or none of stuff you backed up. No option to make individual selections. So yeah. It's OK. But shouldn't Google's premier photo app be great?"

I don't want nags to update or turn on and use services I don't want. Just give the proper functionality to display photos easily without all the bells and whistles.

The one thing I've discovered to watch for is that if you delete an album in the shared section it will delete that album entirely. I lost 3 extremely valuable and sentimental albums full of pics that weren't saved anyplace other than Google photos. So just be careful, it's easy to do and there aren't any warnings."

It's all typical cluttered way of interaction so that one stays anxious and fomo if not seen or saved. Why can't it be a good fun and useful app which stays organised and in control especially after paying Google subscription.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My photos and videos are never in the same place twice. When I edit videos and save the copy they disappear and cannot be found in Google photos at all. The folders and layout change constantly making it impossible to find anything when necessary.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Google Photos is a great app for storing and organizing your photos. It has a lot of features, but one thing that would make it even better is a drag-to-rotate feature. This would make it much easier to rotate photos, especially if you are trying to rotate multiple photos at once. I hope that Google will add this feature in the future. This apps updates going to be a pain when you never includes any extra new features but send updates timely..... ""additionally increase the apps size"" üòà........."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's sort of like the designers don't actually use their products. Adding pics to albums is incredibly cumbersome. I should be able to click on several recent pics and add to a pre-existing album, but I can't. I'd also appreciate more options as to where I want those albums stored. Editing capabilities needs an upgrade. I'm a Pixel user over to Samsung now that is seriously considering other options as fluidity, ease of use and offerings aren't super impressive."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great photo app. Easy to search and find photos of anyone/anything - even your pets can be auto-sorted into albums. Great search AI. Wish it had more robust editing features, but that's what other apps are for I guess. Also wish it had better and seamless integration with my laptop. (I miss the old Picassa Windows app.) My main complaint is printing. The cvs/Walgreens/Walmart easy print option is seamless but poor quality. Don't bother. They feel thin and colors look flat and dull."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,For some odd reason the photos app is taking a very high amount of data. 6-10 GB. And I'm not using the app while this is happens.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I don't know what happened with this most recent update, but ever since my app updated a few days ago, I haven't been able to see ANY photos that are added to shared albums. I get plenty of notifications saying photos were added, but I can't see any of them when I click the notification or go into the app. It's pretty irritating how buggy it is, and since I use the shared album for work, I'm *really* hoping it gets fixed soon."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Update is no good, it's very cumbersome. Getting to your albums or collages, etc takes so many clicks and the items are almost hidden & difficult to find. My albums on my previous phone not syncing to new phone(despite my previous albums being selected to sync) , rather it just dumped the photos into the big mix, so now I must hunt for them. Not sure if this is due to update or just a poor feature of the app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,All in all a great app. Editing is easy and very effective. Definitely worth transferring your photos onto here especially as it doesnt take up as much space. Only thing I'd say though is that when you go onto apps they dont show up on the gallery. I'm not sure if it's possible to change this app into a default gallery and get rid of the orignal one. If you could that'd make this app even better.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app was good before everything was fine but I updated this time it ruined everything,like my photos crashes and videos can't play or you can't transfer photos and videos to another file and...etc"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The backup function is horrible. It never backs up on mobile data (in spite of having that turned on in the settings) and sometimes it will take hours to back up a few photos on my home WiFi, in spite of a fast connection."

When I delete those photos from Google Photos, they delete from the albums on my device as well. Previously, with my previous version mobile phone, it did not do that. I was reading on the Google forum, and this has been an issue for years on select devices. (New to me, obviously.) Is there for a fix for this that I'm missing? Please advise. Thanks."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My view of this apps is too big. Need to get better rates and input of Upgrade and less scam.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This is very intrusive. I was just curious to see how the app worked and when following the encouraged prompts They basically download all of the information online private pictures everything personal data. This is bad. Going through the app there is no reasonable way to clear it out and delete or take back the data once they take it they have it. Very intrusive and no way to shut it down or take it out.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Very useful app generally. Would have been four stars (not five because of the clunky folder handling), but dropped a further star as of the latest update as photo editing is now horribly cumbersome. The new button and slider interface is just horrible...Far, far too many button clicks to get to what used to take one or two. The asking EVERY time if I want to save a copy of the image is driving me mad too... Forcing editing in portrait mode is utterly maddening too."

Why do some pics offer to edit a pic while others do not ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Also when I edit and save, many times the pic remains the same.. Is it editing the photo and storing it? It should save what I edited in my album. Suggestion: that I can arrange my albums accordingly.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It keeps asking me over and over again non-stop to add it to my homescreen, even after I did so in the hopes that would make it stop. I have no idea why it's doing that, but it's very frustrating since it seems to be happening nearly every time I back out from an opened photo (aka return to the gallery). If there's a solution to this, please let me know lol. Otherwise the features are neat, and it looks nice and clean. Just wish I didn't have to remake my albums. ü•≤"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been using since 2016, and my experience with it has been great. And with current situation, it keeps getting better over time. The ability to see your photos anywhere you go combined with the amazing AI tools that is made by Google, you've got the perfect Gallery app for anyone (as long as you don't care about privacy because privacy is a joke when it comes to Google). The moment they took away unlimited storage turned me off a bit, but again, it's been better since. If you have the money, you can buy the Google storage service and enjoy unlimited storage space. This app would only suck if your phone can't handle playing Tetris and your Internet struggles at playing smooth 720p on YT."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Personally to me, all that it includes and or discludes im not to savy with it to have any complaints; however it is an app that Ive always seemed to prefer for the storage of my memory photos & etc."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app has gotten worse over time. As it stands the only real reason to use it is that it automatically syncs with your Google Drive and sharing is ""easy"" from there. It's not that easy though because sometimes sharing just doesn't work, and accessing videos or motion images online sometimes just doesn't work, or there's often a major delay. Also it doesn't seem to let you browse by folder on your phone anymore. Basically any other viewer is better."

So it's pointless to even try to pick faces/pets to remove from Memories. And when I try to choose a date range to not show up, this feature doesn't work either. Please disable the Memories feature in the next update. Or at least have a more user-friendly way of disabling it if others like this feature. I know my husband hate it.

As a minimum, I would like to tag photos, or create categories where I can see an album of related image, as with Samsung Gallery, this is how I find what I like to revisit.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The new redesign is absolutely atrocious. The layout is hardly user friendly and it is harder to share photos than ever before. I was extremely happy with it before the update and would have given 5 stars. Overall still a good photo app with excellent intelligence and cloud storage but the redesign is unnecessary and makes finding your way around the app difficult.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I HATE this app. It has deleted photos more time than it's than I can count. Important photos that I will never get back. It makes no sense that when you delete something on your device, it is also deleted in the cloud. When you download something or save something, it gets arbitrarily saved in one of 5000 stupid folders instead of just being able to find all of your damn photos in one place. I have never seen such an infuriating app."

However, it is very annoying to have all the photos in pre-organised device folders messed up and in the same place now and there is no way to undo it. Could Google Photos please create the album automatically by the name of folders when free up space and delete all the photos from device folders? That will save millions of efforts to reorganise thousands of photos."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I think this is a great app to store photos and to keep them backed up. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because I wish I could have the pause and play button on videos next to the bar were it shows the time lapse of the video. The reason being because whenever I try to find a specific frame pressing the pause and play button makes it disappear on the screen and it kinda gets annoying. But other than that it's a great app to store your photos and videos.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Best ever always been my favorite for as long as I can remembe. Since it first started and every upgrade it's had. Should add some photoshop features. Video and photo special effects addons for editing and creating. That would be the greatest thing ever. I don't understand how some dislike the app. I've had several phones and synced all my photos with this app. And all my photo's I've taken since 2008 are still saved. Even when deleted from the app. They're all still backed up and not lost.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"So much I have to say.... but biggest issue right now is that a ""select all"" feature ANYWHERE in the app would make stuff go so much quicker and easier.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app, but a bit slow when editing"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Your app is GARBAGE. i am sick and tired of having to reload all of my Favorites every single freaking time you make an update. All the 4 and 5 stars review below are all fake. There are simply too many issues yo give it any good ratings. Trust the 1 and 2 stars. These are real users.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Need to give more storage space. Like it would hurt your company to give unlimited without paying for it..... üò°üò°
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"As a pixel owner it is supposed to be the best on this phone. It has some good object and facial recognition software embedded in the app itself which makes identiying things so much easier. However, the app is too cluttered and made somewhat more complicated than it should be. Also, storing photos won't be free for anyone who doesn't own a pixel. I would not recommend using this app because of the storage issue and the overall clutter issues."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's an amazing app full of rich features but with very poor findability. I keep getting suggested highlights slideshows that I love but that disappear when I favorite them! Searching is also inconsistent; with hundreds of albums, I still need to manually scroll through. Limited sorting options and no search when I have to select an album. The experience hasn't scaled to the size of our pictures collections."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Following the latest update on opening photos, you get a banner with the option to backup or do not back up! If you click do not back up the banner just circles continuosly and you cannot see your photos or albums! As an old hand I prefer to backup to my pc, if you were to click backup it's probably too late and your in the realm of paid for storage? Forgive me for being sinical but is this to make money by default? I wouldn't like to think it's the case, needs fixing asap! Disabled for now!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Crashes immediately (S10+). Will not open. Did factory reset and it worked for one day. The crashes again. Paid for 2TB storage and used it for backup, but now useless. Support is useless. Treats customers with runaround. Tells you to contact app developer, which then tells you it's not a monitored email (Google Photos). Terrible support and disappointing service from Google. Moving to Amazon photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Helps save photos from all devices. Thankful I don't lose the pictures every time I lose my phone..!! Better editing options that the regular phone gallery.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really liked the way this app works, everything I need is one touch away for reach. It does give me some good and simple options to stylish a photo and I can create and share albums with my mate and family. Recently, I noticed that it creates some gifs when I take several pictures from the same spot - I like that (but I think it's an old feature that I'm only using it now)."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very exceptional and more advanced to work or play around with memories from way back. it's the technology that makes it easier for us to learn new skills and everything in just at our fingertips. We can access pictures from our emails anytime and anywhere without hesitation. It's important for us to learn about this technologies because we're living in Fourth Industrial Revolution, we don't want to be left out everytime it reminds us of updating apps and helping us not to lose important stuff."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Not a good photo manager app, it has a lot of problems 1. Uploading and back up takes a lot of time 2. Not easy to navigate through. 3. Hard to organize your photos. 4. It keeps crashing whenever I press the download photo button or viewing old photos. The good thing is its very spacious and you can open it on your computer."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's fairly easy to use and is a great option to help save storage space on your actual device. My biggest complaint is that you cant just directly download a large file from Google photos to your device. I recommend saving larger files (that you want to keep in your device's storage) to a separate folder. Then check your settings in Google Drive to make sure that you don't have that folder set to automatically backup.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Very nice features, but heavily duplicate prone. I have been using this app for years and every time I change my Android phone, it creates duplicates of my entire library, which is impossible to clean them manually. Completely unreliable and going to switch to another as this is just impossible to manage with such a huge amount of duplicated pictures"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is the best and most reliable cloud storage and photo/video sharing app I've used to date. I love the photo animations and color pops that it auto creates, the option to remove repeat photos, blurred images...all automatically loaded, and usually pretty accurate! I've recommended this app to so many people, and use it more frequently for photo sharing than I use fb messenger, which is saying something. The video quality remains in tact when sharing, and there is no video size limit. Love it"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Android 10 users beware - this app messes with your phone. The unlimited storage is good which can be perfectly accessed via desktop. But their mobile app has a huge problem. For some weird reasons, the app keeps looping at getting photos and finally messes with your media files. Need to reformat your phone to fix the problem which was a big hassle."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Initially, I adored this application and found it to be of prominent use but today, when I opened it and updated it to new version, I was shocked to discover that I've lost all my pictures of 2019. I mean, I do have pictures of 2018 but not of 2019. Those pictures are of utmost importance to me and I urge to get them back. I hope you'd look into the issue. Immensely annoyed!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"almost, not quite For some reason, it's impossible to control how pictures are accessed when the phone has external storage (microSD). Even when external storage is selected, the default picture options throughout Android default to the standard internal folders; meaning regular moving of pictures is needed as some apps don't allow folder access to other than standard folders. Facebook being one of them btw. As good as Google pictures is via desktop/browser, it's not quite there on mobile."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love the app! All except for the fact I know I made 2 videos. And they disappeared... Completely and utterly. They weren't in a single backup I have 4 different ones, so yeah. Not in a garbage file, or a ""vault"", not on my Google 1, Google Drive, One Drive, or Acronis backups. But besides the Low picture edit options, still believe the camera is equal to the plus 8's, slightly different quality. But I can take pics in the dark, zoom in and still read contract fine print. Not with the Plus8."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Google Photos. My pictures are backed up automatically, so no worry about losing them. I can look at my photos anytime on any device. I also love the look back photos. It's fun to see the pictures I took on a certain day, and to see what was going on . I look forward to that. The photo compilation movies are a great too. This is just a great app!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy having all of my photos stored in one place. I love the ability to edit them. Better fonts and texting, writing, coloring tools would be great. What i do not like when i store my photos either in archive or create albums. All of the photos stay in the main storage place. I have over 3000 photos. And apparently when i delete them from that main storing place it deletes them from the device. If i move my photos, i would like for them to actually move to the album or archive. Thank u"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's very good, but it lacks a couple of features. You can't tag things or people manually, you can't ask it to show a random photo, you can't edit multiple photos at once with the same settings, you can't flip photos horizontally, you can only edit photo's date on desktop, the fantastic year view is gone and it doesn't allow you to enable dark mode unless you have android O."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is superb, if you reset it to the factory version and refuse all attempts to get you to update to a newer version. It saves by default, save a copy is an ootion. Cropping is a one step operation as is the search... just type in the search bar and go... no to-ing and fro-ing up and down the screen."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google photos is the only cloud storage I trust and will probably ever use to be honest. I love the face recognition, categories, and this day x years ago features. It makes searching tons easier, especially if I have to go way back into the archives. I also love the auto .gif making and collages as well as the video montages this app puts together. They make perfect messages to send out to family and friends. I never have to worry about losing a photo or video again. 5/5 stars."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The stabilization worked great on video until I was forced to update the app. Now it is horrible. Looks like they stepped back in time ten years in quality. Jumps in and out of pixlated video. Yeah, after stabilizing, the preview it looks okay, but then you save the stablized video as a copy and after viewing the saved copy its unusable. I want the old app back."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"the app is fine but Google Photos in general is just disappointing. there should be a way to view all of the photos that aren't already in albums. I should be able to delete photos off of Google photos without deleting them off of my phone. Even after I've deleted some photos, my storage use did not decrease. There are just too many issues and limitations."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Fantastic! I love that this free, secure, quality program allows for automatic storage of personal photos, and allows for customization, categorization and editing! It is by far the best and simplest way to access, sort and store photos! And it's great to be able to have all of your photos saved and backed up in the event of a lost or stolen phone. It's saved the day for me more than once, including losing my photo albums to a house fire, preserving all of our memories. I'm forever grateful."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Shotty workmanship people! It doesn't even keep the pictures in the right order, by number or alphabetically. So if I had a cbr file I'd have to view the pictures manually one at a time. It rarely allows us to switch between pictures, by swiping left or right. The lock folder doesn't allow us to search for our files we wish to lock like other pictures apps does! Yea it has a useless search bar, witch 99.9% of the time can't find a file name or folder unless it want to work witch is very rare."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really like this app, it keeps photos organized in as many different catagories or albums as you wish. Simple to use and easy to find the exact photo you need in no time. I like the way it creates albums for every editing app i have, keeping them neat and organized. and so many more convinent features. I highly reccomend for the ease and simple to use options. Great job Google!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Having unlimited storage is great, it assures me my photos wont get lost or deleted. The app also organizes my photos in a way I understand (chronologically) but also allows me to create and share albums with others easily. Not necessarily the best editing options available within the app but I don't see the necessity when it's easily linked to other apps."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love how this app sorts memories and will show previews of photo books the app generated from your photos that you can purchase from the app. I love how it will also compile a short movie or animate photos that are similar. It's great for when you don't have time to sort photos yourself. Also backs up every photo and let's you know when device storage is low and will remove already backed up photos with your permission first.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I don't like the fact that all photos are saved to all Google Accounts linked to you. For instance, if you have a work email and personal email, photos will be saved to both accounts. There is no option to have it save to only one account. Even if you turn the sync off, photos are still saved to all accounts. I tried deleting my work email, took a picture and added my work email back on and the photo was added even though I was signed out at the time... Disappointing. Please fix this Google!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The update is horrible. I can't refresh it, and half of my photos are there. sometimes it switches back to the old way, and I can do everything and have all of my picture, and other times it's the new one. I keep getting so frustrated with how it is working now. I need some of these photos and can't see half then and there is nowhere or no way to find or get to them. The phone I have doesn't have its own photo app, so I can't even switch back to anything. I would give 5 stars to the old updates."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I switched to a new device 10 days back. But even after all this time my photos don't load. It still says getting your photos. I am always connected to a fast WiFi. I haven't blocked any permissions. It is allowed to run in the background. I upload everything to photos and free up space on the device. All these 10 days I've been trying to see my pictures. But just won't load. The search tab is always blank.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The ""memories"" function can be turned off, but only through a convuluted, annoying process by design. Forcing features on users by design and making them deliberately annoying to disable is bad design, and just a pretty messed up to do. Having a simple on/off switch would show at least an appearance of respect for users. I opened my Photo app and didn't need to see a deceased friend suddenly and without warning. There is no transparency and no practical purpose for features like this. It's gross"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Too difficult to remove files from app while keeping them on my phone. It automatically uploaded 41G of files, and then dropped me down to 15G of storage. I now have to download each one individually, save to an alternate drive, unsync, then delete files, and now I can put them back on my phone. What a terrible design. Easy to free up space on my phone, terrible trying to free up space on Google. Most inconvenient POS app that I've ever encountered."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I lost very valuable photos to this terrible app and I am pissed off to no end. I deleted photos and videos that I didn't want backed up anymore on Google photos. Not only do your photos delete on Google photos, but the app goes into your storage and deletes them from your phone as well!! Why?! With the new storage policy, this app will be complete garbage. I'm done syncing my photos to Google."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Absolute trash, missing a feature to select all my photos. Twice I have wanted to select all my photos so that I could download them, and then delete them. But no, Google wants you to use some terrible workaround that will drive you insane doing what is usually a simple task. Let me easily delete everything, and let me easily download everything. I'm leaving Google for good."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've had many photos lost over the years due to not taking them off of my devices, that is until the photos app by Google that utilizes the cloud. Now I'm on cloud 9 because it does everything and more. Easy to access, pull back down to print. I like this App the best! Although, Google please..... release better photo finder. My issue is I have a lot of semi duplicate photos and want to organize by grouping with your assistance. Keep up the good work!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love that I can back up my photos from my phone into Google photos. I also love being able to organize the photos into albums that are easily accessed when blogging, etc. Plus it is easy to share and choose whether to share it public or private. It also automatically organizes pictures by location too. One of the best apps ever. There are even more great features that are easily learned. Give it a try, if you haven't already."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It used to be fun looking at my photos in this app, but now I get so frustrated with it. Once they decided to say that they would be deleting pictures starting in June, unless they were backed up and synced in high quality, I started doing that, only to find that it was creating new copies with new upload dates, which were then uploaded automatically to my Shutterfly app, changing the original dates on so many photos, and the order of the timeline, so that it is impossible to organize any"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,There's no longer an option to edit your photos and videos (even if they're not being shared elsewhere). My slow motion videos can now only be shared (if a very small file size and therefore very short) or transferred to PC in 100% slow motion without audio. I'm running the latest version of Photos with the latest updates installed.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Aggressive bloatware ready to spy on you. Do yourself the favour not to use what's bundled with your phone.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"A recent update destroyed the usefulness of Rediscover this day. It used to show a collage of images from that date and allowed you to scroll into the others, not its a terrible slide show with terrible navigation controls that are not intuitive. I wish there was a way to turn this slide show effect off and revert to the more useful collage view. It's almost enough to make me move my photos to another platform and stop paying google."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Back ups are so important, I accidentally deleted 500 pictures on one drive thinking they will only be deleted on the app, but they all got deleted from my phone ! After trying to get them back for an hour I just opened Google pictures ..and there they all were safe and sound. I'm so happy that I have more than 1 cloud backup! When it comes to the app itself I like it, easy to use and creates albums and stories for me which is very convenient!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this app, and I use it all the time and suggest my friends and family us either all the time. It works really really well and makes sharing photos. One thing I'd love to see, however, is the ability to search photos/videos in shared albums the way we can with the photos on our library. Sometimes, I want a specific photo from the album, but don't want to save the photos to my Google photos and then search them. It would make locating specific photos in shared albums much easier"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"App is useful to back up photos in case you lose your phone or need to factory reset, however it is not a pleasure to use. Screenshots are automatically backed up in the same folder as the camera photos and this is annoying because screenshot folders are usually just a bunch of random useless memes that you want to share with friends and then delete, not keep forever! There's no option to separate them and no way to disable backing up screenshots. Please fix!!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"for directory and meta data: +1 star. for connectivity and appsharing +1. and for photo editing, +1. it's functional, but i had to macgyver a layer-copying spriting system. the scissors snippet tool in another program, mirror, etc. this one is free and it works, but it's a barebones app for which program and design teams spent way too much energy on filters and polish and not enough on basic photo features. if i have to download other apps to pick up the slack, this one's not cutting it for me."

If there is a way to select pictures to direct it to identify faces, I have no idea how. That's the biggest issue with this app. So many widgets and suggestions but absolutely no explanation on what it actually does. I can archive photos, but I have no idea where they go or how to get them back. The special stuff only seems to unlock when it wants but then you can't find it..."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love using this app! The editing features are nice and my photos are easy to save to the cloud and a micro SD. I encourage my friends and family to use this app as well and we share hundreds of photos through Google photos. I also love the movies I can make. The only improvements I'd like to see is for the movies to give the option to not crop the photos in it and for it to save a little bit faster (as I am excited to share my creation). üòä
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoy the whole Google experience. Google photos, specifically, is the best photo/cloud app I've had. I like that it syncs seamlessly with my Google account so I can access anywhere. The albums are my favorite bc I can share photos easily (and securely!) with family and friends. I love how simple it is to purchase prints near me through the app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app and auto backup features are very nice, but the lack of a manual exclude folder option makes the app unusable for me. Photos auto detects album art from my music folders, and makes thousands of new photo albums for each music albums art, making it impossible to find actual photo albums. The "".nomedia"" does not work in this situation, as the music would then go undetected. Many other gallery apps support manually excluded folders, I would love to see it implemented here."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It was great until they started counting photos towards your Google space. I'm going to find another app. Which is really frustrating because otherwise, I've loved Google photos. I like the memories it creates and the different creations it makes. It works with timehop. I don't like that it's not easy to download created photos lately at least on mobile. I'm hoping they'll change the decision to count photos towards overall storage."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Whenever you try to edit a photo, the image disappears. The screen goes completely black. How do you go about editing an image that is invisible? I have been very keen to update the app whenever a new version is released hoping that the bug would be resolved but to no avail. To make it worse my phone didn't come with the stock android photo viewer/editor. So this is the only editor available for me. Can you fix this bug please! How about image autorotation by device orientation?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The photos app has been getting worse and worse every year. Now, it won't even save my edits (even though it says it does). Additionally, I have had problems with the automatic backup feature which has resulted in the entire loss of albums I'd curated from thousands of photos. I shouldn't have to be online to make an album that should upload when I get back on wifi -- and all my work I do offline certainly shouldn't suddenly disappear the minute I get wifi back."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I created a new album and all my old albums disappeared. For months the app has been telling me to update it, so I did that, hoping it could relocate them.. The app started uploading stuff automatically with backup turned off.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The Best app I've ever had! it makes collages for you to view and save; if you take a bunch of pics, while out at a park with the kiddos, at a Concert, or Whatever- then it makes a video, collage, giphy and more, from the pics you took. or selfies. It Really is the Coolest thing. I have never had a problem with it. Use This App!! You Will Be Happy With The Results. If you don't like the photo, etc., then you don't have to save it. It gives you a Choice. Cudos Google Photos!! I Love What You Offer"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It helps that I have a new Google Pixel 3XL with a phenomenal camera. The Google Photos App is the perfect companion. But, it is also a terrific app for my entire household's variety of other Android camera phones. I love the options that are available to customize, enhance, and manage all of your photography! If there is something that this app can't do, I haven't found it! If there are other options that a person might want to have, I cant imagine what they would be! Again, hats off to Google!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Does a semi adequate job with very basic things. Bad at automatic suggestions (especially bad at automatically fixing photo orientation). Super slow, especially with album management. Especially hard to share groups of photos to albums now. Just generally bad at sharing. Backup and sync works almost flawlessly, which is why I use the app. Search works well though would like to be able to, say, find the cross section of photos of groups of people."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Photos as the default app that stores your images and videos is the worst idea ever. It's the worst app to use. It's so disorganized and annoying to use. You can't create a simple album to store videos and images in one place. Everything is all over the place. Videos and images are saved separately, not in one place. You can't move things around easily. You can't even view the pictures you've taken of you don't have wifi. This app should be a backup, not the main storage tool. Terrible."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Truly remarkable! This was the app which I was searching for. Easy to get photos clicked from numerous devices without any wastage of time, automatically uploads photos, that's what I want. Unlimited storage and high quality photos. Unfortunately, Google photos is changing its policy which can't be tolerated. A free account only get a 15 gb storage which is enough to get insufficient in a month! For that I am certainly rating four stars. That feature only gives best distinct from other app."

I don't want to put my photos on Google's cloud so they can use them as training data for their commercial products. Photos keeps trying to upload my photos, without a cancel option, even with sharing disabled in all the ways, and the only way to stop it is to disable the app. I don't care what their terms say today. Facebook has shown that terms change, and I doubt Google is giving free storage without some idea of commercializing it"

There is no option to stop this, really annoying!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've used this app for a long time, but recent changes have made it completely useless. I had used it to store images of several types, and upload to social media. I had created 'folders' for different groups of images which made it easy to quickly find the image I wanted. Now I cant even upload except from the initial photos section which has all my images and would take a long time to find the one I wanted. My solution was to use file manager so Google Photos is useless now."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"First, it overloaded my Google account storage. Next, it deleted four years of photos from my phone under the guise of ""freeing up storage,"" because the photos were all backed up on the cloud. Nowhere did it mention this change would permanently remove photos from my phone, because there is no way to undo this change. As I often work offline, this deletion is maddening. I want to uninstall, but sadly it means I probably can't access all those photos again (not on my phone, at least)."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Everything is always perfectly fine and amazing definitely the best way to store your photos in the best digital world. Its always so precise. They look up option could be better but its pretty decent and works amazingly if you work with it to take your time and modify the settings so you help the app do its work. Just one little thing atleast in opion that would make it better it doesnt have to be all of it cuz at times it does get annoying so maybe have an option in the settings to turn it on and off is maybe like when you place photos in an album it only stays there and no longer shows the same photo along with all of your other photos. For me personally that would be better sincw i have everything in there already organized and gets confusing when i havent organized them in a while and idk where i was :(. But thats just personal adjustement anywayd the app is amazing never really crashes has happened only like once in all the 8ish..7 years ice been using it. Ive been using it since 2011 now im 18 lul and still have never found a better app
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Google photos. I can keep my memory down on all my devices by clearing my photos, knowing they are safely backed up.

I love the Google assistant that makes me collages and videos as well. I absolutely would recommend it, and have recommended it to all my family members who now also use Google photos. Excellent app!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is creepy, arrogant, and weird. Completely out of nowhere, I'll get a notification that Google photos has created a collage or done something to one or more of my photos without my permission. Apparently Google needs to look up the word ""boundaries,"" as though it were a narcissistic sociopath frenemy. Um, I'm going to keep Amazon Prime just for my photos--it's so much better than Google, even though they're both evil corporations."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I was using the photo gallery that came. In the phone and all of a sudden, I'm switched to Google photos with NO OPTION OF OPTING OUT. I had photos set to save to my memory card, by default. I had folders set up for sorting. Now, all photos are saved to Google, which I DO NOT WANT, and I can't move them to my memory card. I do not like the invasiveness of google, nor do I wish to use them. I posted a question asking how to save my photos to my sd card, and it was ignored. Not happy AT ALL!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app works fine until you try organizing your gallery in any kind of way. Folders randomly disappear all the time; the photos are still there, but somehow the entire folder is lost. Only some of the pictures show up in the area where you can separate them into folders or albums. There is also no eraser for markup but otherwise, editing pictures is fairly easy."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love how Google Photos saves everything no matter how old your phone is. Whenever I take a picture or video, if the lighting is off google will automatically do it but I still have the option to save it if I want. Google even puts together movies for you. After I got back from a trip to Florida, google put a whole movie together with most of the pictures included. This app is awesome and I trust them very much! Thank you Google!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The only thing that seems to frustrate me are the bad reviews not using the app for it's intended purpose or misunderstanding what the app is. So you can view the existing photos by folder on your phone, cool. These can get backed up, you can create your own albums within photos as a sort've 'virtual' folder. It's not a photo editing app, stop criticing this and use a photo editing app instead. It really shines with its searchability of photos. Search for 'food','cats','blue hair' and it works!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great app. I'm not one to write reviews but hell this app is awesome. So many different options to choose from. You can style your photos and videos however you want. I bought one of the photo albums they offer and the book/pictures came out awesome. A little frustrating picking out pictures and then saving it and then coming back to it some photos didnt save and I would have to reselect them and re crop/edit them but other then that. AMAZING!
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I saw this app had eaten up almost all of the space in my drive by syncing my photos automatically, while I had no clue. I wouldn't be able delete my photos without also deleting them from my phone üôÇClever trick to make people buy more drive space, google! The backup&sync turns on on its own even when I turn it off, which is creepy as heck! Would give 0 stars. Disable permissions prior if you don't want to run out of drive space suddenly and have to delete photos manually, possibly losing many"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm a photographer and I love the ease of performing basic editing. techniques that can be done in the field using my phone, when I don't have my cameras. plus all your editing and original content are synced to all devices. sharing privately, to social media, or even to Google maps is a simple task that looks very professional. just add a few filters and add-ons to your camera apps and you can get quality pictures. It even has a link button to continue editing in other prefered apps. sweet."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's nice to have backup storage but what sucks is that when I create an album I have to go back and re-""check"" all those pictures to Archive them, so they'll be out of sight for creating another album. It's just major eye fatigue to have to look over those pictures again, pick them again and hope you got the right ones out of there for archiving. I was hoping they could create a command that moves them into an album and archives them on the same keystroke"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I loved the idea of it but when I try to create a video it wont let me actually save it or share it on social media. I've wasted half a day trying to get this to work but the video wont get out of processing after several hours. Reading up on this people are 10 months and still waiting. Sounds like it's best to find a other app. I was really happy with the video so I'm extremely disappointed I can't use it or have to wait hours or months to use it, if it loads up."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The app does a great job at storing and backing up pictures and videos. It has helped me recover many pictures I thought I had lost. I really like it. My only regret is that there is no way to arrange the main gallery into folders and locked their view. When you open the app and first thing you see is a bunch of pictures dumped into the main gallery isn't nice.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Really handy to have. Never realised how long it had been saving photos for me until recently when photos I thought I had lost forever showed up on my 'memories'. I love the automatic stylised pics the app creates... Although I've never managed to figure out how to stylised pics of my choosing or how to edit pics so that isn't very clear.... Overall though this is a very handy app to have!!!
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Since yesterday all my photos and videos are sorted month wise. Like, a whole month photos and videos altogether rather than been sorted date wise. I don't know how this happened because earlier it used to be date wise rather than month wise. Please suggest me what to do as soon as possible. It is really frustrating. The app is really great, I love it. But this problem is really bothering me."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Getting better, but the UI is incredibly frustrating and non-intuitive at times. I especially hate that I can't zoom in to see if I'm selecting the correct photo if I've already selected another photo. Also, I can't select just one photo from a group of burst photos. Have tried many times to remove music album artwork (on SD card) from Photos albums but no luck. Then I have to scroll through hundreds of unwanted artwork ""albums."" Don't get me started on the de-intgration from Google Drive."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love Google photos because they will save all the photos you have ever taken on your phone and they put together little animations of a bunch of photos or even make little movies of photos taken over time. it's an amazing app and I recommend it to everyone! It does take up quite a bit of space though if you don't keep up on cleaning out the photos you don't want though because it will save literally every photo you have ever taken ever, unless you erase it from Google photos. AMAZING"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"A recent update turned audible notifications back on after I'd turned them off. This resulted in my phone beeping when it was unable to back up photos. (I was away from WiFi for several days.) This noise happened at *2 AM*, costing me a decent night's sleep. Frankly it is hard for me to see a situation where I would ever need Photos to give audible notification. But it should NEVER turn audible notification back on when the user has explicitly turned it off."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app gives you absolutely ZERO control over how you want to organize your photos. Automatically sorts them by date with no way to change it. Sorts albums into a single flat hierarchy instead of letting you group them into folders so you'll have to scroll though hundreds of albums to find what you're looking for. Trys to use AI to sort your photos but the AI sucks. Clearly made by a team that just wanted to deploy something and move onto the next project.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing and I love it too, I can back up all my photos and very useful as well üíñüíñüíñüíñüòçüòç"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"1) A lot of synchronization problems. When moving to trash/clearing in web version, they still exist in app. 2) Not everything can be viewed in app, especially the videos which are available on web version. In app you see only ""not found"" error. 3) Not all motion photos could be converted into still, because option in dropdown just never appear. Not all motion photos loaded. 4) Cannot convert group of motion photos into still photos. 5) Photos backup process cannot run in background properly."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Distorts local library. Removes photos from default locations. Can't share without dowloading.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great secondary storage app for any and all of your photos! Personally, I've been using Google Photos as my primary gallery for over a year. The automatic backups and automated collages and stylized photos typically create things I would love to hang on my wall and now you actually can have your photos printed onto a canvas! Give it a try at least! It's well worth your time!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Don't like the promise of unlimited storage of photos at original quality, only to have it taken away. Which bucket items are stored in can become confusing--- especially when editing a photo from long ago--- it disappears into a hard to find place. Photo editing software has fewer options (e.g. I used to be able to move the light focus for fading but now it's set as a concentric circles from the edges)"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"First it randomly rearranged the photos in an album that was in a very specific order, more than once. Now I took a bunch of photos in a slideshow and deleted all but one and then when I went back to look at the photo, I saw the app had decided to swap the photo I kept with one of the ones I deleted. The deleted photos are not in the trash (I guess because they were part of a slideshow??). The photo I wanted is gone forever. Deleting this now."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Don't like app. Too many repeated items taking up extra space. I want to create own folders & don't need all this pre-named catagories that get in the way of moving things around. I liked the way my older Moto was set up much better, but unfortunately was stolen, so had to buy new. Not as happy with this model. Don't need the memories past items either. It's too much duplication using up space. Same pic in too many catagories . I don't want my pictures sorted by dates, I sort by album."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I want more than anything to be able to organize the HUGE list of photos. I know I can make albums but I want to be able to organize them like I can on my phone, not just copy them as well to an album. Seeing that huge massive list is overwhelming...and being able to completely move them from one Google account to another would be amazing."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is so easy to use and lets you know when you are running low on space. It gives you very reasonable options to purchase additional space if you need it. You start off with 100 free Gb's and I purchased another 100 for just $1.99 per month. It also gives you the option to delete video and pics that are taking up room on your device. Simply let google photos backup your photos and you can see them anytime, easy peasy. Great way to make some wanted space on your phone. So far, I love it!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Pretty good app so far wish that the the editing software had a few more features but works for simple basic stuff. Ok it's been a month of use and my opion has dropped from what it was originally absolutely hate the way Google sorts your photos just kind of throws them wherever it feels like and you spend huge amounts of wasted time looking for them there's got to be a better way to do photos
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"While this does what it intends to do very well, the ""smart"" UI is a pain to work with. The app really wants to try to hold your hand, but becomes so unhelpful in the process. Trying to have autonomy becomes difficult, for example viewing large file sizes to help manage your free space is tedious and an exercise in menu diving. I wish they would create a photo utility PC app to allow you to sync, not sync, or store offline each folder or photo. So I'm looking for other ways to manage photos now"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I don't know what I would do without this app. Being an amateur photo editor, transferring photos between my phone, multiple computers and even cameras has never been easier. With one account I can move anything between them with ease. I managed to free 16GB of space from my phone in less than 5 minutes, as it automatically backs up and saves photos. 10/10 fantastic app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Shocking at the minute. Can't search for photos 9/10. Wish I hadn't updated to the latest version when it told me to yesterday ü•¥ Reboot doesn't help. Various other things I've tried too. It runs so so slow. Not impressed in the slightest with the latest version. Just tried again, constant circle going round on the screen and giving nothing when searching. Internet fine with all other apps/websites so I know it's this app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"App is up to the mark except for couple of things. First, There is no option to move photos to a particular album. Even if we're creating an album for a particular set of pictures, the added pictures still appear in the main frame which technically should not happen. purpose of Moving picture to an album is to not see the photo elsewhere or else the entire purpose of segregation is tossed. Second, There should be an option of sharing from the locked folder as well. Kindly review."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Originally, this app worked great. Lately though, when I try to open either Google Photos or my phone's camera, it immediately cuts out, and a message comes up saying ""Photos has stopped"". (With the message also occasionally coming up at random times when I'm not using Google Photos). I'm now unable to use it. I've tried restarting my phone, and it didn't help. I presume it's a flaw related to an update, but would someone with the ability to do something fix this bug?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's the best in every way. I don't have to specify all the ways. It comes from the famous ""Google"". What else do we need?! It has all the solutions regarding image and video problems. If your phone has a short storage capacity, then it's the right app for you. You can store unlimited pictures and videos and your phone would not get the notification 'storage full' and you won't even need the gallery of your phone. You get editing+organising app. I'm so glad to Google for making this application."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Make it easy to download my uploaded photo to download again in my gallery . My google storage is full and now I think it's useless to use google photo even email is not coming to my id. And also give multiple selection to delete photos. Why clean up storage delete my phone gallery image not google photos image I lost all my photo through phone. Useless and bad app design.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Simply want to save photos from my Google account/cloud to my device. No option. Did research, seems at one time it was an option. Thus, I'm assuming Google has since removed the capability. So I'll do it manually, and never back up to the cloud again. I should have control over my photos, point blank. Edit: See the developer's response. You can only do it one photo at a time. They're right, the ""download"" option is there, but only on a single photo. No batch option. Still bad design."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is my everything photo app on my phone. I have lost my phone in the past, but never worried about losing my pictures because I had Google Photos. Just recently, I made a couple different photo album books using the app, customized the photos and captions, and they are being sent to me by christmas. Great overall experience."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Samsung Gallery to o view/edit my pictures ever since I got my first Galaxy phone (the Galaxy S3!!) many years ago. I only recently started to use Google Photos in addition to Samsung Gallery for photo editing purposes. It has a lot of cool features that Gallery doesn't; such as the ""Tools"" feature. However, something I really like about Gallery that I wish Photos had is the horizontal and vertical tilt functions. Also I feel like the filters could be expanded and more diverse."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What the heck so loading it's takes 1-2 hours my picture can't find , the app is willing to backup even without my permission grrrrrrr"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love Google photos it definitely helps me keep my photos in order. I do wish there was more editing offered in the app. Being able to sync all my albums in photos from all my devices I've had has allowed me to have photos from 10 years ago still I love it. It's very easy to use very common sense knowledge of how to use would definitely recommend to everyone wanting to hold onto memories in case your phone gets destroyed which might have in the past but yet the photos have always syced. Luv it!
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It lacks optimization for the largest font size and does not adhere to Android 14's accessibility feature requirements. If you adjust the display size and text settings to maximize the font size and then open Google Photos, you will notice that the text at the bottom of the application, photo and search option, is obscured by the images located just above the text. Although I cannot provide a screenshot, this issue can be easily replicated."

It will create movies, collages, and animations for me and the best part is that all you need is your email and password to get to it from anywhere. I have gotten so many people to start using this app and they love it! Now we can share photos so much easier and faster!!! The best app ever!!!!!!!"

"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app has been amazing, I have been able to store all my photos and videos easily. By doing this new update for June or July 1st, it's going to eradicate the usage by a lot since its used for keeping and saving high quality pictures through the years. I am not happy about this since they are forcing money to get better quality pictures when it was free before."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There's still a lot to like about this app, but the recent UI overhaul is a huge step back in several ways: - Doing any kind of sophisticated image adjustments is much more clunky and requires so many more clicks. You can only adjust one parameter at a time (e.g contrast) whereas with the old UI it was easy to adjust several things at once and see how things looked collectively as you make small tweaks. - The slider controls for adjustments work backwards - drag your finger to the left in order to *increase* the effect - The background blur feature seems to have disappeared - On my Galaxy S10, I often can't delete photos - it wants to send me over to Samsung Gallery to do that, which didn't used to be the case. - The full-screen slideshows for day in history are really unintuitive to navigate - It may be my imagination, but the Auto Enhance doesn't seem to do as good of a job as it used to I'm by far not the first person to complain about these changes. Hopefully Google listens and fixes them. Photos has been the best app/service of its type, and these changes have put a big hit on that reputation."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Straightforward app for managing and editing your photos and videos. Love the auto features such as animations, maintenance, stylized photos and ""look back"". A must for anyone who uses their phone to take photos, well...yeah, pretty much everyone.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"While the editing options are very elaborate, which allow me to enhance already good picture quality even more, it sometimes fails to save the edited picture. Seems random and is super frustrating after spending 10min of adjusting the settings and then not being able to save! Tried restarting it and clearing the cache, nothing works. It's not a storage issue as I have over 100GB free space left. I have a Samsung galaxy A13.."

Even crashes when trying to use with bank apps and barely can deposit checks, can't take photos in any apps. Night photo was great, now it doesn't work. SMH. If you switch between front and back cams you can sometimes actually take a pic on the forward lens. I realize these are different apps but I am so disappointed with Google. This is just somewhere else I can rant. Pixel 2 XL."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"As I've stated in a previous rating I would really like to see a finger print/passcode option to get into the app. Also I would like to see a feature that can recognize and suggest to delete duplicate photos.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Google photos has great features like saving pics allowing them to be backed up and organized into folders and yes the collages are pretty cool. But i don't like that pictures i have in folders you can still see in the photo section. Also the collage feature isn't that great anymore once i realized i can't choose the pictures i want to be used for the collage i want or even just allow me to add a couple more. Google also will highlight a random picture but i can't choose the 1 i want to do it to

I love that all my photos are stored and backed up automatically for me so I don't have to worry about losing them, but some of the features are hard to use and a little confusing to me. For example, when I am trying to share my photos with someone else and I try to seen them via text it wants them to sign in or something and I still haven't figured out how to use the sharing thing on the app. If it was a little more user friendly for those of us that aren't as tech and computer savvy it would be a great app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very good app for storing pictures and videos. It is also a great help during travels where you and your friends can create a shared album and just share all your pictures together so you can post real time if you want. Plus upon downloading the app, I found old photos here because I didn't know I still have back up of pictures I had from my previous phones. It also has that feature that creates stylized edit on your pictures and creates animations for consecutive shots. Overall, great app!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There is a button called ""free up space"" it should say ""free up space on your phone"" and explain what is about to happen. If you press it, all of the photos and videos on your phone are deleted and uploaded to the cloud. Great until you realise they're all at a low resolution. My videos are now useless. Thanks Google. I've lost hours and hours of footage for a project. Furthermore it dissolved the folders that I'd spent hours arranging."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app has so much to offer, then you realise to get your photos back it's an absolute nightmare. Keep well away from this. Do not let it back up your files. As soon as I've figured how to get my photos transferred to my laptop. I'm uninstalling. If I can't sort it shortly, I'm taking the hit, losing all the photos just so I can uninstall and get rid of it. It's as bad as the Chromebook"

ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT, I GIVE IT 10 STARS"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The big problem with this app is that once your photos are synced and backed up, if you delete them on your device then you can no longer see them in their original sorted albums from your device when in Google Photos. You can see them sorted this way on Google while they're still stored on your phone, but not once you delete the original, even with backup. They should stay sorted into your albums so it's easier to find them rather having to scroll and search by date. Too hard to find anything."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I HATE this new version! I now have multiple folders with he same name. Before the update all photos showed in a single folder, i could still search by folder, but newly saved pictures were at the top of the list REGARDLESS of the source, e.g. screen shot, camera picture, saved from a text... The app is TOO helpful and complicates a simple process!!!"

"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The thing I hate about this app is not being able to create folders to organize. Yes, it will make albums for you but you can't correct them when they think your dog is your cat or it puts someone in the wrong album. Can't drag n drop into albums. So really it's useless because it takes forever to find any specific photo unless you make folders for yourself all the time. I'm surprised Google hasn't improved the functionality of this app over the years I have used it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"While using shared albums, we cannot use photos added by another user to make collages or animations or even upload on Zoomin for prints. What's the point of sharing the album then? Also while adding photos to Instagram, I can only see photos from WhatsApp and Camera, not Albums. No options of hiding photos in albums, everything shows up on main page. Also after a while old photos keep getting deleted from Albums."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Worst photo manager I've ever used, would prefer one with zero frills. Doesn't remove duplicates, just hides them. If I try to delete the one photo showing, I delete them all, though. Files often don't show up for over a day. I can see them in other apps so I know they're there. Can't open folders if there's 8 or less images inside, which means I can't move photos to other folders for some arbitrary reason. Can't delete empty folders."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app does as promised and has some nice features, like creating sharable memories/stories. The major draw backs for me are some of it's major features like cleaning up storage on you device, it will not do as it says and only remove older photos it takes photos from all times and even from hidden collections üëÄ. This sucks combined with the fact that you can't share pictures from Photos to text or other apps like you normally would, you have to share via a link to the images."

So if you are switching phones or trying to access photos from your cloud to upload for other things, you can only do it one photo at a time. I wasted 10 minutes trying to figure it out only to learn that this basic feature was ignored. What's up google? Google Home integration with photos was a nightmare too. Samsung wins."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So far for an application on a pocket miracle device whose primary purpose has been lost far, far, far to the wayside as a ""uh, yeah, you can make calls too, if you need"" phone, does a lot if nifty thongs along with all of the standard things tgat one would expect of a photo application. huzzah, keep up the 'remember when' flashbacks! I love seeing hoe awesome my life used to be eight years ago!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like photos and the automation is good, but i like more control and the ability to put pics in folders etc. It would also be good to add a tag editor. Using one drive alongside photos because i can edit using serif affinity from one drive. Photos was perfect when it synced with Google drive but now its not so great. Google, please put it back the way it was."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What have they done! The apps horrible to use, doesn't even pick up different galleries when trying to send a pic it's not user friendly! They have messed this app up big time."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I would give this minus stars if I could and here's why. I use the default Xiaomi Gallery app on my phone. However, Photos saved blank thumbnails of every video (well over 2000) I've downloaded since owning this phone in the Download album. I got back 3GB of space when I deleted all those blank thumbnails. However, when I uninstalled Photos app, it deleted 17GB worth of my videos which weren't created nor were ever modified with Photos. FIX THIS!!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"My photos are some of the most valuable and irreplaceable items important to me. Because of the trust and dependability Google has provided me with, and I've tried other photo apps, I have chosen Google Photos app as my number 1 choice for all my treasures for safekeeping. Reliability, quality, organization, storage, and easy accessible from my devices, I feel secure with them. Thanks Google for outstanding performance and continued improvement of Google Photos app for my Android phone."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,If I could give this app a 10 star review I would. My wife and I link our accounts so I don't even have to share images with her any more she gets them as soon as they get up loaded. Also all of the automatic assistance for albums and collages! I mean come on now if I could only get a subscription that would automatically send me some of the great memories from each moth that would be next level.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My photos are all fuzzy looking on the app when I open it to look at them.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Pretty good for organising photos but not much else. The creation features are utterly useless. if you make a movie there's absolutely no way to actually save and share the finished video file. tried a million ways and it seems there's no fix to it. People have been having the same issue for years and nothing is done. Google doesn't really seem to care about user feedback at all.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love the fact that I can easily backup everything on Google Photos. It's literally a godsend. I can't believe people pay for icloud storage when this is a free option. The functionality is super simple, though i would say people with slower connections might struggle to upload videos sometimes. I've convinced all my colleagues and family to use this for their storage and so far I've had no complaints. I also sometimes like the automated edits and animations in the For You section."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Was happy with this until today when the app seems to have decided to delete 15GB of photos and videos off my phone after backing up to the cloud. I am very pissed about this, since they do not offer any undo. Plus the cloud lowers quality. Just got back from 10 days away and knew my phone was full. Was going to copy the original resolution files to my backup drive as I always do. By the time I looked at my phone, it had updated the Google Photos App and somehow ""auto free up space"" is turned on!! I'm SO ANNOYED BY THIS. Lost all the original quality files. Totally unhappy and now thinking of getting rid of this Google Photos app and replacing it with something I can trust. I am so mad right now."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Deleting anything on here deletes it in your gallery too and once it's synced you can't easily unsync it. (the warning message did not specify that, it only said it would delete across google platforms) and when I tried to restore everything it said I didn't have enough storage?? So I signed up for the free trial to get enough storage to get my photos back and delete the app, but even after that it was beyond complicated to find the cancel plan button."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Thank you very much to Google Photos!!!!!!! Problems Solved/Amazing Features: 1. Easy moving of pictures to other folders. 2. More convenient to organize pictures on phone gallery. Detects/recognizes local pictures and folders. 3. Easy to select pictures 4. Can select multiple pictures conveniently via hold then swipe 5. Quick loading of thumbnails 6. Works without WiFi 7. Helpful Assistant 8. Auto-creator of movie/animations 9. Automatic backup to cloud 10. All FREE!!! 11. & many more!
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is a great app. The photos you take with your phone sincronize almost immediately with the cloud and are available for viewing in your computer right away. My favorite feature is the face recognition one. It will display a face and ask you to name it...once you assign a name to it you can type that name and will filter all the pictures in which that person is....including the ones you may have taken decades with an actual camera and that you uploaded at some point into the gloogle's cloud
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"1. The way the app displays photos is very confusing. I always cannot tell if the photos is on my phone or it was uploaded to google photos by other devices at first glance. This is very annoying especially when the storage is not unlimited anymore. 2. I don't want to use backup and sync as I don't want the app to upload every photo on my phone. However, I cannot find the settings to let me choose the quality of the photos I'd like to upload."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"My only real complaint is that the Google photos (along with many other Google apps). Are OFTEN updated, but the changes are more often then not, so drastic it can be like trying to learn how to use a whole new app all together. I appreciate the fact that Google does their best at keeping up with their apps N fixes to bugs etc, just wish they wouldn't make such dramatic changes to have to find my way around at any moment my phone choses to update!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I just don't know what I would do without my Google photos app!!! I absolutely love it. The storage is unbelievable. I'm always going overboard and taking a ton of pictures so the assistant is very helpful by putting together collages, animation clips, and movies which you can also do yourself plus a ton more awesome features. l've been using this app for four years hope you enjoy as well as I do!!! Thank you Google üòä"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a wonderful application. I only wish that it were more like Chrome for Windows, giving users more options for individual preferences. ie looking at sources (drives/devices); File types; loving the compatibility with Microsoft and Outlook but you could go even further... Considering they all but ctrl+alt+c and ctrl+alt+p'ed your source code. Freeware or not. I love the tag function and organizational scheme. More streamlined and polished for smartphones be good."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,If storing photos is all you're looking for then this app is ok. But if you want to create and share albums get ready for a never-ending headache. There are ostensibly 2 ways to create albums & add pictures to them. Neither method works. I have to create an album 3-4 times before it actually gets created. And then I also have to add photos or videos to the album 3-4 times before thru actually show up.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,One of the best app there for android photos and videos. It reminds us of the memories that we had on the same day earlier. It styles and makes collages of our images automatically and upto the perfection. Even the editing options that comes with google is plain awsome. I enjoy using all the features that it has to offer. Face recognition and grouping of pictures is amazing. Love that you can easily add photos to multiple albums.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app was good for a while. But the loss of a key feature has made it difficult to enjoy using. We could once select which album(s) on our phone we wanted to back up to photos, now everything is automatically uploaded and saved under ""Camera"" with pictures/vids you DIDN'T want saved now saved and its frustrating. Cause if you send them to trash it will delete them from your phone. I sent feedback about it and never got a reply. That one feature loss screwed this app up for me."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"If you like the way this thing works you'll love it, if you want to be able to do things like delete, rearrange, move folders quickly, change order, do anything you should be able to do with an included gallery app you won't. Layout is garbage, the background is stark white, there is a trash folder that makes it so your old JB gallery won't even delete photos properly so you are forced to use this Google garbage. Either let me uninstall this, or let me customize it like I used to be able to."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's okay. Good enough to get me to use it instead of the built-in gallery app, but lacks: 1) Lots of useful features I see elsewhere, including downloading any photo! Mostly I have to share to email, send them to myself and THEN download, that's a joke! 2) Face recognition is limited and infruiating. Only around 50% accurate for me, often limits my manual editing capabilities. Doesn't pick up on enough faces for me to use it reliably."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Awesome app. I love how you get extra storage in the cloud which makes it easy if you're switching from phone to phone. The other cool thing about this app is that it automatically pulls up old photos from years prior and especially someone like myself who has a young child to be able to relive those moments all over again is pretty awesome.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Please stop asking me to backup to the cloud. I get the popup every few days, and now there's 2 popups I have to exit every time I want to see my pictures. I've clicked ""No"" 57 times already....get the hint or give me the option to turn off these prompts."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It sucks deleting pictures from gallery can now delete from Google photos too , then what's the point of having it"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It would be nice if Google would quit changing the formats on all of their apps and then they decide to eliminate them for a newer app that doesn't work nearly as well, like Google Gallery, it sucks. But this app needs fixing still. If I am placing a photo into Archive folder why does it still appear with the other photos? There is no need for a photo to appear in multiple folders, if I put it into a specific folder, it shouldn't be in any other folder it's a waste of space."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app, easy-to-use, a few confusing spots. When trying to move things to folders, it doesn't get removed from the list of photos sorted by date. I also don't like that I CAN NOT choose multiple photos to be moved into an album at one time. Otherwise good app, good storage not bad"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The service is great. The app needs work. Photo editor is absolute garbage. Filters are worthless. Needs histogram, needs HSL sliders. Google owns Snapseed, why are those tools not integrated into Photos? At least the basics. Albums page is designed for children. I need to be able to zoom way out and get an overview of my albums and sort them differently, view folders on device and know if single photos are backed up or not, and need to be able to pinch and zoom in and way out within albums."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Since the previous updates the landscape photos are not displayed in full screen anymore but with the black panels/edges on the side which ruins everything especially if you have a big screen and you'd like to see the pictures in a full screen mode. P.S. same in the portrait mode, doesn't show the photos in full screen anymore. Please try to fix thia issue. Thank you."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a very good app for storing photos and videos at a high quality with unlimited storage... This app can be very useful for maintaining device storage... As it has got an option free up space... In which it will erase all the photos and videos on the device which are backed up. By this way we can optimise our device storage easily. This app also has editing tools in it and we could easily edit those photos to our wish. Also it contains an assistant which would select some photos randomly and marvelously edited. It also includes many other things such as collage maker, movie maker, animation etc. In this app it also arranges the uploaded photos according to their respective face's that is we could easily view photo of a specific individual with out searching the whole thing.. I'll always recommend this app for every one since it's the best. Thank you google for giving such a wonderful app....."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like that my photos goes straight into google storage from my phone. that bit is fantastic. What is super annoying though is the styling of the photos and the animation done without being asked for. it is,a lot of clutter until I delete it, which I always do, because they are so badly done. if I want to apply a style, give me the option to do it myself. please just keep my photos safe.That is all this app needs to do."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Stop trying to force me to update. The full screen prompt is extremely annoying, and there is no point in updating a mere gallery."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"sharing photos to upload to Google photos is too slow. even if 90percent completed and network changed ,you have to start over from beginning. if screen locls for a duration again uploadcfails"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"tagging still needs improvement. it would be nice if i could manually tag people in photos instead of waiting for the assistant program to figure it out. it's amazing how the software can find the person in the background in out of focus shots, but not when they are the only subject in a full portrait. Mobile app has hard time communicating with desktop/ windows version. Facial tagging is poorly synchronized between the two. üòíüòíüë®üèΩHas hard time recalling previously tagged faces."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I like using the blurred background that enhance the picture at the faces
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I just wish my dumb phone came with a regular photo app because I'm sick of this app needing to update every couple weeks at 30mb and I literally see no differences with each update. Just wasting data.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"My complaint, which seems significant, is that menu options come up when I click on the camera, thus I have missed shots entirely when it was a time-sensitive photo opportunity. While one knows this is technically a useful feature, it felt like a camera malfunction. Simply, in some moments, I thus missed good shots: would it not be better to find a clever way to persuasively invite customers to take a moment to learn about/customize features? Maybe I missed that?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Best photo app out there. unlimited storage it has been with me through dozens of phones. i LOVE the search feature (family member names, objects its like a google search but for your own photos.) only down side is how long the ""fix lighting"" feature takes. many times i have to force close the app because its frozen trying to fix the lighting."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely HATE this app. You can never find your photos. If I can't find find a photo after looking in every single album, I can find it in the general album ""photos"" but I have to scroll through hundreds to find it. If I create a new folder to put photos, I'm doing it so they aren't in just the general spot. Do they move from that spot once I've ""moved"" them? Nope. Now they're in two spots. This app is the bane of my existence!!!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When exporting edited videos in Google Photos, the process doesn't seem to finish; it just keeps loading. I already clear my cache and reinstall the app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It was a good app. Now it's terrible. I'm continuing deleting it, clearing cache and memory to ensure it start backing up all the pictures. After weeks waiting for the pictures to be backed up (without success) I have to delete and reinstall. Every week the same story. Also, I don't see all the old pictures, I can see them through the browser but not through the app. Since few months now. Google one user, Nexus/Pixel user since the very first model."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The updated version is terrible, anytime you edit a photo it puts it into another album and then if you try to group your photos together in specific albums it will still keep them in the original albums and you can't delete them so you have several copies of the same photo in different folders that you can't delete without deleting it from all of them. Very cluttered and unorganized."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Backup takes ages. My videos will take long even. I can't create a link and send it to any app or shared album when that happens. Can't download multiple photos at once. In next update, make it to where we can download certain multiple from certain apps (this will be under a label of course). Photos take ages to load up. Do not click Free space, it deleted all my messages! All are gone, very angry about this. Couldn't stop the process once it started either. Put a disclaimer next time!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've had this app for about 7 years already and it used to be really good about syncing like as soon as you would take a photo, screenshot, or something else but it would sync up the pictures ASAP and now I have to go into the app every 2 weeks so all of my pictures can back up all the way and I hate that so much. I think you guys should fix please. Thank you very much"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Taking photos is great. But after spending a painstaking amount of time cleaning up the photos, I'm still randomly getting duplicates. I also created a number of albums and am so frustrated that I can't access those albums via Instagram or other photo editing apps (instead I just get the entire photo gallery). I organized my photos for a reason. I would like easy access to them across platforms so that I can share them how I wish (ex. Doing a collage of my pregnancy photos). Honestly, the camera isnt worth this hassle and I wish I stuck with my iPhone. Lesson learned."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I can't stand this app. It is frustrating as hell, as it has the tendency to eat the whole days 2gb data in a matter of minutes, even when backup and sync are switched off. Data usage is set to 10mb a day, but still it using as much as it likes. I'm writing this today after closely monitoring it and watched it eat 400+ mb (while back up is switched off) and not a single photo was uploaded. 400mb for what? And unless I allow it to use mobile data I can't see my saved photos. What a pain..."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Wont let me access my photos within 24 hours of downloading/taking them, no matter which folder they're in, through any app. It'll register they're there in the Google photos app, but then treats it like they don't exist through any other app. Can't imagine if I had to work on a time limit using this. Terrible. Been irritated with it for months but didn't say anything cause it used to just be 20 minutes before I could access them, now it's like there's no point taking photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Offline use is not really a thing. The app aggressively clears downloaded photos. Let's say I want to review a photo I had taken of a trail during a previous hike. Even if I make a point to load the photo from the cloud, it is aggressively removed by the app. But like many things, it feels like I'm being punished for daring to use an app without an internet connection. Edit: the developer response is condescending. Where are these things stated?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"To save storage, I've been deleting photos from Google Photos since I was sure they would still be in my phone's SD card. I just deleted a few photos from the app when, upon checking my phone's storage, saw that the photos were missing from my SD card. I checked my Trash, and they weren't there - the photos were permanently deleted from both my phone and Google Photos. *Edit: I was able to get the help I needed, and now everything's fine!*"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,google photos is great. It allows you to clear up space on your phone by storing your pictures for you elsewhere. Accessing your photos is made easy with Google Photos (even across multiple devices). The only thing that has kept me from rating it 5 stars would have to do with loading. it seems like it can take a while to load all of my images when I go try to access them.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I can't disable video autoplay when looking through my photos. The motion makes it hard for me to see as it will for others with visual impairments. I just want to view static photos but there's no option to disable. Definitely a step backwards. It also adds buttons at the top with feature photos but these can be removed thank goodness.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love this app. I've had installed for many years, have over 17000 photos not including the archive! I've never had any problems or issues with the application or storage and of course everything transfers automatically with login on new phones. No picture/video loss worry's is a wonderful security feature included as well.

It is trying to backup all my photos from present to years and years ago that were previously backed up. They are now counting against my storage which shouldn't be happening since the change in what should count against your total space started in June 2021. I've always kept my Google photos to auto backup/sync so I wouldn't loose anything. Not sure what's going on. I purchased an workweek 100 GB for storage. Please help asap!!!
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I am really enjoying it.. However... I have noticed Google photos seems to delete your videos at times trying to make room for the new stuff which is no good!!! These were videos from once in a lifetime! I had a really awesome video in West Virginia of a horse walking into the barn and back out! Now it's going forever and I will never be able to recapture that moment. üò≠
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"When I started using Google photos it said ""free unlimited storage"" now it wants me to pay for storage. If I would have known I would have looked for other storage options long before I started using Google. There are priceless photos on here from my loved ones that are no longer with us so I can't just stop using them. Also, there are very limited free options for editing, cropping and fixing your photos. It shows you what you want but you have to upgrade to paid."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why is it that if I make a new folder and move pictures into it, the date of the photo changes to the date it was moved to the folder and the origin date goes away??? And you won't let me edit the date???? So now all the pictures are out of order. Can't change it back, that's not an option either. Stupid app. Google, go back to being useful because as it is now, you kinda suck. Update: 03/22 - Still not user friendly and moving from folder to folder is a pain."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this photo app and use it every day but I feel there could be some features added to it to make it even better. First I wish there was a way to add a person to the photo without the app recognizing that it's someone. I find it happens a lot, it might be a side pic and it doesn't know it's me. Also tags would be a great feature. Like the people tag but you can create them, like ""Cars"", ""Tattoos"", ""Food"" for example. I feel it would make finding photos easier if you can group them yourself."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app used to be great. Take lots of pictures and videos, access them from any device under your account. It can even find certain things, although the AI is a lot dumber than I know Google's capability is. Once you run out of space though, the party's over. Either you start paying (which just increases your dependency on Google) or delete a bunch of stuff (per their suggestion) or do what I'm doing now - just ignoring them. Now I'm backing up photos the old way, to my own personal computer."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, Google Photos has always taken care of my photos for an example,the date,time, location of where the photo was taken!

If I am watching any video in this gallery and I have to go back due to some reason then it dosen't ask me for resume playing, it only resumes if I am directly out from gallery. There is no support for resume playing a video if I click a back button. üëé"

Saving/downloading a picture doesn't have it show up in my pictures for texting, Facebook, smartframe, etc. So sharing pictures of s a lot more inconvenient. My phone doubles as my camera so that function is a priority for me."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm kinda stuck with it since it is the default gallery for my phone. But so far, it has been good as it relates to me having more storage. And the photos remain the same quality. However, One drawback is that I don't always see my photos in the photos app as soon as they are taken if I don't have immediate access to Wi-Fi where it is not synced as yet. I love the assistant that comes with it and the ability to search for specific people in my gallery"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If you like to edit your photos after taking them, don't use this app for it. When making edits to photos on my phone or on the web browser, the edits aren't visible unless you actually go to edit the photo again. From my research looking for a fix this has been a know issue for over 3 years that they just refuse to fix. Very annoying. Edit: looks like this bug just applies to filters, it appears to show the lighting and color edits ok. Still not good."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app for media management and backup. Recent integration with assistant helps keep clutter under control and ""rediscover this day"" features constantly delivers pleasant memories.

No rational explanation, and there not in another account! I checked that too. ALWAYS Dubious, updating this app in case I loose even more photos. Every time they do so-called ""improvements"" it just gets HARDER to find photos, not easier!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Everything seems to be going downhill since i moved to pixel 4xl. This app behaviour has changed for the worse and old features like things assistant created for me are nowhere to be found. And overall performance of the phone is junk. Glitchy, Bluetooth issues. Probably going to return it. Too bad, I thought the pixel 2 was great."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is OK but needs a lot of improving. First of all, the videos are not labled with text which isn't detectble for screen readers which is the same on the website. This is particularly glaring since you took away google photos access from google drive, i used to record programs on catchup sites and save them on google photos, so doing away with the google drive access and the problem above means it is pointless. Using the movie editor is problematic as well since you are forced to use music, but the app is slow also which slows you down as well. The backup and cynce feature is another problem. It is quick to snatch a photo or video that has arived in a folder that you wanted to backup, but it doesn't give you a chanve to rename the file and if you did rename the file while in the backup process, the original name is kept."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Like most things you do, it's a great idea but you made a mess of it. Why do you have to make EVERYTHING so difficult to interact with? Yes, I would love to keep everything in one place, but sometimes I need to import/export things to/from Google photos. I have to jump through 6 hoops to get it done. Need something in a specific ratio? Nope. Google won't do that one! Gotta spend 30 minutes getting it somewhere else that will and then another 30 minutes getting it back into photos."

I HATE GOOGLE PHOTO, I DO NOT NEVER AUTHORIZE GOOGLE TO JUST START SHOWING ALL MY PHOTOS TO EVERYBODU OR ANYBODY THEY CHOSE TO. ONLY ME/I WANT TO PICK & CHOOSE WHAT PHOTOS TO SHARE NEVER GOOGLE!!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,There needs to be a way to stop content from uploading once the uploading has already started. There needs to be a distinction on the app to identify content that is showing on your phone from the phone's hard drive vs. what is being displayed from the cloud without having to go to each individual file. There are also a few other minor quibbles but for the most part it works fine.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I want to specify the storage place for downloaded photos. Like when I download photos from Instagram, it's automatically create a new folder called Instagram. And screen shot are stored separately. I would prefer I can choose to have only one folder for all them. I can only edit the time in the camera folder, but I can move every photos to that folder, it doesn't make sense to me. It would be helpful if it store the time of the photo created, instead of the time I downloaded it."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"could be easier to use, less of the assistant assault. Do not need to have to repeatedly shut that part down every time i try to view a photo also could offer auto backup when connected to a data source or wifi without having to be asked, turn on auto back up and go... aside from that there needs to be an option to draw, crop, edit inside app. currently using second app for edits. lastly.... to become a better app, the real issue to me is the ability to auto save to drive, that'd be nice"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"If this app can delete photos directly from the device folders, it should be able to restore directly to the device folders. The app attempted to backup all of my device photos and ran out of space. From the app, I deleted everything but a few key images I wanted to keep. However, I later found all of the images had also been deleted FROM MY DEVICE, even though I was using the app. I couldn't restore the images because the app didn't have the space for them. This seems like an oversight."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I will never use google photos again. Ever. It seems nice, but multiple people have tried sharing christmas albums and festival pictures with me over the past season and none of them will appear. I have searched far and wide for trouble shooting tips, followed multiple avenues and nothing has worked. Apparently the problem I am having is a known issue that Google has done nothing about for over a year. I would really like my memories, but Google just doesn't seem capable. Back to HDD I guess."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Unstable and does not value user's time invest. When selecting pictures to add to shared album, the app frequently crashes with no error message. Then you have to start over again, even when the selection of hundreds of photos is lost. Please please please add a feather that saves the pictures you have highlighted so you don't have to sort your photos several times!!!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is absolutely the most useful application developed by Google. Not only does it ensure that our photos are safely backed up in case we lose local copies, but it reminds us of good memories, creates mini-videos automatically, offers fixing rotated images or creating collages, and it lets us free up space on our devices. Also, the search function is really powerful!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's fine, but it wants to group my pictures into categories like: sunsets, forest, birds, ect. which I can't access from other apps for some reason. I also can't figure out how to turn it off or put them back. As far as making albums and photo books go it is pretty good. it is also very easy to share photos between devices on this app."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have all uploading turned off in the settings but if I make an album to organise my photos it starts to upload the selected photos and videos with no way of stopping the upload. This ""bug"" is extremely user unfriendly and I really hate it. It'd be a perfect app without that bug; simple, easy to use and fills it's purpose."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is very limited. The photos and videos categories like any normal camera gallery is not an option, the editing is limited, the backup is not perfect (the videos can be backed up on a different day). There is no option to mute the notifications on a shared album but still have the access on it and the list can continue. Whatever happened to our beloved Google apps? They all are going backwards. I understand the ""safe to fail"" concept and being agile and try new things but this?"

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The ui is super confusing. Actually, a surprising number of google UIs are super confusing. I regularly find that learning what should be a simple app takes a ton of work and oncd I do figure it out I dont feel like the journey was worth it. No, its not intuitive, and no, I dont find that the added functionality is worth the fuss. I write apps for a living, and UX is what I specialize in. Google UX haa gone downhill in the last several years."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Extremely helpful and reliable. When my kids fill my phone up with pics and videos, periodically my Google photos app lets me know that it's all backed up & gives me the option to free up X amount of gigs.. (today it was 19 gigs).. All I had to do was hit a button. Also, I never have to worry about losing my pics or videos & easy to print from the app or anywhere else."

The organization, the frequent suggestions on different collages and stories, the creative collections that are put together for me are all a huge plus. I also really love how the memories come up and how easy the photos and stories are to share with the rest of the family through their Google photos app."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I do like that it's easy to share the photos with other Google users and search by people, dates or places. But it drives me crazy that it often doesn't pick up all the people or pets in the photos and if it doesn't give you the option to manually add tags to the missing pet ls or people. You can only edit the tags of the faces it's already picked up"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I used to love everything about this app, but over time issues just grow. Sometimes moving photos from one album to another causes them to dump at the top, instead of ordered chronologically. Wish there was a way to change the dates of multiple photos at once because of this issue. Sometimes when I crop a photo, the action loads indefinitely and I have to exit the app. It does have a lot of good features - the editing software is great and the search option is impressive."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's okay, the features like Animations are cool but slow, it's annoying to create and sort albums and folders. For some reason I can't create any new folders like I want but can only make albums. My phone won't sort and show albums, only folders when I'm looking through files. It would be helpful if it would let me make my own folders. It's all just meh."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Editing features are too clumsy. - If album has been shared with other users then editing features doesn't work. - if somephotos are edited from album directly, after saving it doesn't shows up in the same album, but also throws you out to the buttom of the first picture list in that album. - Some advance editing features like ""portrait light"" , doesn't appear even in the portrait pictures. It is so clumsy - Editing tools, doesn't have an option to select only specific parts from pic and edit it"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I find nothing wrong with this app and it's latest upgrade. It still functions well, when you go to search you find all your pictures for different people. The overlay has slightly changed but it affects nothing of what I was used to easily access on it before. Honestly speaking I was afraid to upgrade after reading some of the problems other people had with it but for me it's absolutely perfectüëåüèΩ I really don't see any thing that is difficult to get on this app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It doesn't show everything in your system. Only certain categories like screenshots, photos (camera), selfies, and some downloads. All the other phones I have with a built in photo app had all your pics in different albums, and it was incredibly simple. The reason I gave this app two stars is because I do like the backup and some other features, but the fact that some of my pics are not showing up, even though I just downloaded them 3 times, keeps me from giving a better rating."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I really loved this a app. The way it arranged the photos on the basis of time and location it becomes very easy to search for it. And the grouping of similar faces is just awesome. The smart feature I loved about this app is it's recognition of things in the photos which makes it easier to search for the photos of particular things.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This apps has brought me to tears with frustrating, the functionality of this app has made me decide that I will go back to Apple for my next phone. It is not straightforward, all my photos are not together on one folder, you have to search around folders to find what you need. It's even more frustrating when trying to use IG, the album's don't link with the app. if you clear the clutter, it deletes photos and says they are archived in Google photos, but they're not. I've lost my wedding photos"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Can you please add a feature to display pictures and videos by folders from which they are added and to display those in albums automatically, or should say, to create an automatic copy of a device folder and to save it there, so I don't have to do it personally, it would make it so much more convenient for a lot of people with a bunch of photos. Over all this is a great app, but if you add these changes I think it would be used by a lot more people as the stock galery app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best Google app in ages! I have the premium subscription (Google One), and this offers the cleanest way to organise my photos. The ability to identify and search for people and pets is awesome. And it offers a neat array of editing tools, including some real nice enhancement features.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Cleared almost all photos off my phone when I thought it was clearing up space on the app itself. Layout is confusing, meaning you will eventually misclick something. No way to retrieve all lost photos on the app unless you log on to the actual website; Even then, if you've lost thousands of photos, you will only be able to retrieve 500 of them at a time, making it a painstakingly long process. There is no option to clear storage on the app without clearing your phone's storage."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This used to be a great app. But the new design doesn't work very well. My favourite feature before was the automatic creations it would make - stylised photos, collages, videos, animations. Now, I still seem to get notifications about creations occasionally but when I click on the notification to see it, it's nowhere to be found."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"May 18, 2023 Update: Not only does the app lose any and all photo descriptions, but just taking a photo is grueling. After taking a photo, the app buries the photo deep within the phone's directory and is near impossible to find using the folders and if you try to move the photo from the app, it gives no clear options on where it can be moved to. Extremely frustrating!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This one of my oldest favorites which also keep some of the expected features at bay for a long time. Still, searching, tagging, grouping and sharing photos is way easier. The way it reminds you of past moments at the exact time and stylizing photos selectively is just awesome.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"A useful app but terrible in how it controls all content on your device. Even when I move a photo or video from the camera folder to another folder, and very explicitly uncheck that new folder from those that should be synced by this app - the app still finds the new file location and takes control of it. I just want to save some space on my Google account by moving them somewhere out of Google's reach so I can remove them from my cloud storage but keep it locally."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love all my pics in the cloud. No more freaking out when my phone gets lost, broken, or stolen. Picture memories mean so much to me! Thank you Google! Please keep free, and mayne one day offer a service we can print any sizes straight from the site free. That would be amazing. Only thing I don't like is when I want to send a video via text or messenger, and it makes me alter video, maybe make smaller, i don't know I'm not that photo app literate. That part is dumb to me."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There seems to be a regression in the app. It went from blazing fast to super slow. This is especially true in the sharing portion of the app. Pages don't load anymore, or take minutes to do so. To be fair, I have a lot of pictures, (more than 20k just of my kids,) but it didn't seem to be an issue before. I love the app, but there's probably a bug that was introduced recently."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is more of a suggestion though, I feel itll'd make this app to stand out if you could add a feature to the library page where backups are segmented according to the folders from where they were backed up. Idk if I'm making sense, but it helps with location of specific pictures. And i know its possible because photos backs up pictures with paths also attached and I think that's more than enough to group pictures and would help people who change mobiles frequently Thank you!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Awesome app if your text savvy. And even if you're not, all you got to do is read and follow the directions. It may get frustrating at times, but it gets easier. You can put things in different spots and albums, and such, and free up space even though it's in another space under the same 15 gig limit...

"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It has some very nice features, really, it does. But it has some really annoying features, too. For example, I want to use the app to look at pictures other people are sharing with me. I do not want it to upload the photos that I take because all that does is fill up my google storage (which is another grievance I have since storage used to be unlimited for free, but I understand that that isn't going to change). However, the app will not let me use it unless I give it access to my photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is great in backing up my photos/videos and offering good features. I came across it by accident and thought that I was going to lose my photos when it started backing them up at first. I got scared for a while not knowing exactly what I did to start the backup but once I spent more time with it I realized my photos would be okay being saved on google. The only thing is the quality of my photos and videos are not the same once they were backed up? They look too dark. Why is that Google?
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Haha wow what a horrible product. This is why Amazon is going to win the war. Amazon gives unlimited photos in original quality to prime members which 90% of the population is. You only get 15gb on Google and then Gmail stops working. A completely unrelated service. Oh and try and free up your storage on their app, good luck, they don't let you sort by size or make downloading all you picture to a zip file easy. You have to select them one by one. Can't begin to describe how bad this app is."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I'm harassed every single day to turn off sync for my photos there's no option to turn this off. Google feels the need to do this why?
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Used to be a default app, users couldn't do without. Somehow Google changed this setting and made the app counter intuitive. Sync is deactivated sometimes without explanation. Also, instead of photos showing up by most recent, sometimes they are shuffled and you can't seem to find the ones you need in chronological order. Lastly, the editing options inside the app are very limited and outdated."

The image is now very small on the screen, especially in cropping, which makes it very difficult to, say, crop to the edges of paper without cutting off parts of a drawing, or otherwise using the tools provided with any degree of precision. Fixable-ish by using the google photos site on a PC, but horrible in-app if not on a huge tablet."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love the Google Photos app. It is amazing. I especially love the search capabilities. I'd love to see one improvement. You can use the search bar to search by a person's name (if you've assigned a name to a certain face). If you search for two people it will show you every picture that has at least one of those two people it it. I would love it if you could search exclusively for photos with both of those people in it. Like in a normal Google search when you put quotation marks around two or more words to get results that only contain both of those words. It would also be great if this applied to making a photo album based on people. Right now when you create a new album you can make one that adds all of your photos that include one or more people (and continues to automatically add photos of those people to the album as more photos of them are taken). It would be great if you could adjust the settings so that the album only adds photos that include both of these people. It seems like this would only require adding a new database query and a few additions to the front-end. I know you don't want to over complicate the app but I think that this feature would be so cool and useful that it would be worth adding. What couple wouldn't love to put in their names and find all the pictures of them together (without the pictures of each of them individually). Hope to see this in the app someday.

There were some were photos luckily saved in google drive instead. As for the others, I can't recover them at all. üòßI sometimes don't like saving in google drive, because you'll have to upload it and move individually to a file you created."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Worst app on my Google Pixel 7 Pro. I pressed the Free Up Space button to see the options. Instead, it just deleted all the photos on my phone that are backed up on Google photos. I wasn't even able to cancel it. So now, I either have to download all my photos back one by one (because they made so that you can't download all of them at once :) ) which would take me a whole afternoon at least or pay 2$ per month for their cloud storage that I don't want. Very cool !"

All my pictures are out of order and when I click on the photo it still shows the correct date but when I'm scrolling through my pictures they are off by days or even years. I have tried searching how to fix this, Uninstaller and reinstalled and cleared the cache and storage. Nothing works! They are still viewing correctly on the web version though. 5 stars if I can get this issue fixed."

Yes, I know some of my subjects appear inverted. That was completely intentional & I get tired of the program trying to ""help"" me ""fix"" the photos. I still use Photos for some things but I have reverted to backing my more important stuff up to stand alone hard drives that I can secure and that are not connected to the internet and that don't give me irritating and repetitive ""suggestions""."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The new update is all about sales and selling prints of your photos. Theres a shopping cart icon so you can quickly order and purchase your own photos but the option to organize has become more difficult. It seems you are now limited in the triple dot drop down window to delete or move to archive. There used to be the option to move photos to other folders to keep photos organized easily but now it seems like the focus is $. Bring back the option to multi select images and move to other folders.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Bad... Honestly, I preferred the good old stuff where you just had your photos on your smartphone, and when it was too much, you just placed them in your pc files, and nothing gets lost. Now, photos get lost, backup into my so-called Google account but I can't even find it, the app creates files I don't want, or categorising them by location or event type... Duuuuude, I just want a normal timeline photo app with no bling bling or whatsoever. And I (!!) want to decide if I open a folder or not."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"All photos are filed away into very specific folders, there is no all photos folder. So you know you have a specific picture, but you have to know if you were sent it, or you took it, or if you edited it. Ridiculous. Also I seem to have to back everything up. That's not optional. I bought a phone with double the storage and am being told that I have to pay more to buy Google external storage for my pictures and to make my own folders etc."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Miserable to watch videos on because it doesn't have basic navigation features like ""skip ahead x seconds"". You can only navigate a video by CLICKING the *tiny* bar at the bottom, it misbehaves if you try to click and drag. Also you can't change the thumbnail for video or sort within an album by any criteria other than the name of the file (which is not displayed). Also there is no way to hide things other than the SINGLE ""locked folder"", which will not back up."

I love that no matter what kind of photo library you have on your phone, this app will still be sure to keep copies backed up in their database.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really great app except for some things: I hate when you do an edit using something that requires you to save the photo as a new version, it destroys all the metadata. A photo taken weeks ago on vacation edited will lose the GPS location, and the date will be set to the day you took it. Awful. Also, the photos built in video player does not play 60fps videos at 60fps. They store at original fps but in playing them they are 30fps. Other than these issues it's great."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Google Photos pretty consistently since picking up a Google Pixel back in 2016. Watching the app evolve, gradually adding some truly mindblowing features and UI improvements that have made it into one of my favorite apps to use. The AI-assisted highlights and automatic edits rarely pick the best photos to work from, but have occasionally produced some genuinely happy moments, like an automatic summary video of a recent trip or a cute little montage of all of your recent pet photos. Shared libraries work great - I think they've made that even easier now with ""Partner Sharing,"" which is one of those little tweaks that show the Photos developers are thinking about how people are actually using the app and their phones as cameras. Honestly one of Google's best products. Love it."

Little did I know that it will completely erase my gallery storage without a single option of retrieving the data! If it is deleting them it should be in my device recycle bin or there has to be some option to retrieve it. My 2 years of memories completely erased thanks to Google."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. I have a suggestion to make. The outcome of photos while taking selfies is mirror images in many phones. Some phones take the actual pics, some cameras have the option to flip the image, some phones have the tool to flip the image in gallery.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's the worst photo app! When you're out of storage you're screwed. They force you to pay. You can't transfer photos to your computer (you can but every 2-3 photos are in separate folders. I have over a 1000 so I have to open each folder). The other option is to back up your photos to the cloud. You can't select photos to back up. It's either all of them or none! Extremely inconvenient! And of course you'll be out of storage in the cloud too so you have to pay! That's why I went back to Apple!
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very useful, it would be greater with an undo function. It's because if the 'Free up space' function is selected by mistake, an undo function would be very useful.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Disable cinematic photo memories. I have android version 12. I enjoy the ""looking back"" photo memories it shows me multiple times a week. But recently they added a ""cinematic"" feature where each photo slowly zooms in or out slightly with no way to disable it. It's distracting and made the experience way worse. Disable the cinematic photo view. ALSO when scrolling through the memories, I used to swipe up to dismiss the feed. Now I have to press the X, less intuitive. Can I roll back this update?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This app is useful at times and I regularly use it but it feels like I need to navigate more menus than I should to get somewhere. I hate how it shows picture of animals that are currently dead it makes me sad and some of my recent photos from a few years ago I dont look at intentionally or it would show a spotlight memory thing of a picture of a rash or gross injury I have sustained I also wish it was just trying to be a photo app. It's good if this is what you want but it's just so cluttered.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Every update to Google photos reeks of feature creep. New add ons like a mandatory pop up to fix lighting on every picture, or automatic adjustments that often make low light pictures look worse come to mind. As does folder sorting among others. Can't say I'm a fan of the app. Or that I would use it if it wasn't impossible to remove."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,15GB of storage isn't a lot and I don't need to pay for extra storage. Otherwise it's a decent app.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I wanted to delete some private photos from the app when I realised it was automatically uploading them from my phone. As this was too many for the trash bin, it has permanently deleted them. I did not realise that this meant deleting them from my entire phone. As a result, I cannot find photos of my newborn child. This has caused a ton of stress. I can't find any way of getting touch with Google to see if they can recover them. Unbelievable."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the app! Great organization and simple. Pixel phones get awesome features with Google Photos and I love that. I have a Pixel 7 now. As much as I love having my photos in digital format, I love even more being able to make them into prints. I occasionally make orders for print and they come out beautifully. Tagging of faces is another feature I don't think I can be without. It's beautiful to be able to think of someone and be able to do a quick and search for your memories of/with them."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I took away one star from my last review because Google now wants us to pay for basic filters and limiting storage and another one for meaninglessly making the interface more difficult than before to go to the filters section. Honestly, Google didn't have to make a separate default screen for just 3 filters (Enhanced, Warm, and Cool) and then make us slide twice to go to all filters. Stupid UI, not expected from Google. The app otherwise is great because of its auto face and object detection."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Fantastic in terms of storage, albums and face detection. Two gripes: First, it is still missing access to seach when adding an image from other apps, so its useless if you have thousands of photos, and second, guests to an album have access to the sharing link of that album (even if you just invited then through photos), so that they can share YOUR album with whoever they want without you knowing. it doesn't make a lot of sense, if you invited through the app, avoiding sharing the link. thanku"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google Photos is easily both one of the best and simplest photo apps. It has a bunch of great features. It makes it very easy to create albums, movies and stylized phots. The Google generated recommendations for the same features they automatically send are generally pretty good and worth saving as well. The ""Then and Now"" comparison pictures that come up sometimes are fun as well. With an easy to use interface, free photo storage & fun features this app is a keeper for sure."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app keeps playing random music over my memories and I hate it. I don't need some sappy music playing, especially if I'm in public. At least give us an option to turn that off. I find the songs annoying too, super distracting when I'm remembering friends and pets that are no longer here. I used to look forward to reviewing my memories everyday, it was a nice bit of joy that has now been tainted by this unnecessary music. Let us turn it off."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hands down the best photo app. Google offers unlimited storage and even for high resolution images from your pixel phone. Does Apple do that? I'm sure you can guess the correct answer. Better technology. More innovation. Affordable for everyone. The best modern tech company that has yet to let me down. Thanks Google for your products, your benefits, and changing the world in such a hugely positive way."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app used to be great, but for no reason they changed the interface to be less intuitive (why is sharing now separate from the other categories, accessed by a chat icon?? Nonsense). They got rid of the ""for you"" tab which featured stylized photos and suggestions and I really miss them. For a moment yesterday the app reverted back to the old style and I was so happy, only to be disappointed again today. Really disappointing changes that hurt a great app."

Some phone cameras already included some of these features, but having them in an app would level the playing field and move value from the phone HW to the OS."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New storage subscription model is a clear bait and switch. The app also has very poor UX. E.g. when downloading pictures from an album to my phone, they often won't appear in any of my phone's albums, or they'll be very hard to find if they do download properly. Sharing an album is often a pain. When trying to add a Gmail account to a shared album for example, it often says ""No Google account found"" and then I have to either make a public link, or try to download the images. Has gone downhill."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It needs basic improvements. (1) No 'Trash' button inside albums so it's impossible to delete photos from there. (2) Adding descriptions is annoying, the keyboard overlaps the text field. (3) You can't see if a photo is already included in an album (only available via web). (4) You can't edit the date of a photo (only on web). (5) Sometimes I get blank menu when tapping on the the hamburger button and photos are not loaded in albums. (6) It randomly duplicate photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is quite good and reliable. Its user friendly, makes it easier to share your media to other relative sources. And i love how it reminds you about your past memories those that i personally forgot about. If there are any changes to be done, i would recommend the theme to be changed, and for privacy sake keep the recycling bin hidden in options rather than exposed for retrieving information."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I hate that it sorts all your pictures into four folders and there is no way to merge them, meaning if I need to find something I was sent and saved I need to go through several different folders to try to find it, since they go in a different folder depending on the app you saved it from. Extremely annoying."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I despise this latest update. It is basically non functional. It is very difficult to find all of the image albums on my phone. If I want to email a photo to myself or someone else, it is very slow, and then it doesnt email a copy if the photo, first of all, it takes longer to arrive because it involves syncing instead of simply emailing, & emails a link which is very hard to print. I am a musician who often emails myself and others photos of a hard copy of music so that they can print it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I hate the new memories format so much. Before it showed memories ""on this day 2 years ago, 3 years ago"" etc and I really liked it because it felt fun and organised. Now it just randomly shows you memories from a random period of time. For example, showing a photo from July 4 years ago when it's October. Plus the photos have no context and they just ominously zoom at you. I don't even understand what I'm looking at half the time."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really dislike the updates. The ""favorite"" button moved to the library. One extra unnecessary step. The update to editing eliminated the ""exposure"" slide bar which also added extra often unnecessary steps to the process. Often all it took was to adjust the exposure. Now you have to adjust a bunch of things to achieve the same effect. Another annoying thing is you now have to go to the library, then camera to select more than one pic to send.

You can't adjust the the shadows, the brightness, you can't fade out, you really can't do anything but accept the original photo without improvements. Google give us the old version back! PLEASE! FRUSTRATED!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Google Photos does not show pictures stored by other apps, such as WhatsApp, in the main photo overview unless you decide to send everything up to the cloud. It knows the photos are there, but it makes you go to a separate menu to access them. Again, unless you back them up to the cloud, then magically everything appears. Google is clearly trying to deliberately inconvenience you into turning on their cloud services."

The restored photos are again getting backed up, after moving it to a new device folder. Copies are created in Photos. We need a ""folder"" backup feature which creates the same folder on cloud as the one in device. Its extremely hard to sort pictures on Photos."

Scrolling through the 16k photos that where in my app when I updated my phone is extremely inefficient. It seems like a pretty simple feature, moving and sorting photos. Every other photo app from previous phones have had these features. I hope Google can make these changes soon. In the mean time, looking for an alternative app... any suggestions?!?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a nice app, but I wish there were more features. It is so hard to manage the photos and albums. I wish you could store albums within groups. I also wish the albums were in alphabetical order when you need to move a photo to an album. It would also be nice of you could turn on ""auto archive"" if desired, so that after you move a photo to an album, you don't have to reselect the photos to move to archive again."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Don't really care for this app as I expected a lot more functionality from the geniuses at Google. For example, the algorithm that picks out photos and suggests archiving is great, but it ends there. I can't zoom into the photos in the archive suggestion view to confirm what I'm archiving. Or, often times its a great suggestion, but I want to delete instead of archiving. Nope, no way to do that aside from exiting the view and finding the photos manually."

Thank you for finding a way of keeping and relieving beautiful memories shared with important people in our lives. Just awesome!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is so powerful with a lot of feature. It can automatically back up my photos and videos. Can share my photos with everyone with ease and easy to access everywhere. However there is one problem, when I log in my account on pc to see my photos, my deleted photos showed. I was shocked, I swear I deleted those photos manually in Google Photos app in my phone a long time ago before this happened. So I hope the developer will soon fix this."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app has one major fault, you can't put any of your pictures on an SD card. Only Google cloud storage, so in effect you really don't own your pictures in a traditional sense - you're renting them. Once your phones storage is full you are screwed. Monthly rental for your photos is not for me especially if you take a lot of pics and want backups in original quality. No, I need my own physical storage in addition to cloud storage. Just when I began to like it too. Works fine otherwise."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"In an attempt to make an already simple app ""more simplified"", you seem to have ruined it. The sidebar was easy to navigate with, especially seeing as I used Folders a lot for organization. Then they got rid of the sidebar and, to my knowledge, have no direct access to Folders. You have to manually search for it. Simplified to the point of being annoying."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Looked promising at first but turned out to be one of the worst apps I have ever used. Syncing didn't work properly. It also lacks some of the most basic functionality (or hides ir so well that you can't find it within 90 minutes of searching - I don't know). All I wanted is to delete pictures out of the cloud but NOT from devices. Never got this to work...
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Have had this app for 5 years now, all issues are from this year alone. Won't sync with the desktop app, unable to back up and upload photos/videos on my device, unable to free up space on my device. I even tried deleting things off my phone manually: the app showed the backup was complete and was still unable to free up any space. Literally everything that I would want Google Photos to do, it can't do. What happened to this app??"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Its a good, solid photos app and storage. Syncing is easy and useful. But It needs more options tho. For ex a dark theme instead of just a white background. Ability to draw and add text from the edit menu. Another thing would be to have the option to adjust in the settings whether you want ALL pics in the main gallery. All saved, camera, downloaded, Instagram saved, Photoshop saved. Right now, PHOTOS section is only camera pics. Hopefully the make these little improvements"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm been generous with this rating, on top of the editing issues already posted I also have issues with the albums, I have my photos in separate folders ""albums"" as a photo management app it should convert the folders into albums or at least let me add a folder as a album, there's no way to do it. The app is designed just to upload to the Google cloud which I don't use. Hope Google will work on the usability of there apps."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Every time i get the notification that I've got a new stylised image, my heart jumps and I quit whatever I'm doing to take a look. sometimes it's just a jazzed up version of the photo I took of the label on a product at B&Q, but ither times they bring alive a less than stellar photo of the most beautiful sunset over the see that you've ever seen. I live for Google Photos. The editing is unmatched. Also, my photos are now better than my brother's."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolute best cloud for Lrg. storage. Auto-sync from all my devices makes my life much easier. Dont even have to worry about forgetting to download or moving one item over to another. Its simply done w/o me. Plus, great editing features. App offers suggestions on how to create a better look or has tools for one to experiment themselves w/ the different styles. Plus, always ask if you wanna save the copy and/or original. Honestly, I dont know how I wld document my growing kids w/o Google Photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,They keep optimizing for deleting your photos instead of being able to keep them locally on phone. You can't even select two photos and then click download. You must do them one at a time and even then download fails on some photos. Pretty clear they only care about a very small number of use cases and to hell with everyone else and to hell with bugs.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Definitely the worst update ever. It has made it so difficult to find anything, from photos to features that were quite handy before. Would be way better if this was on a beta version, and still having the possibility to revert to the old, stable version. Updates should be relatively improve the experience, not cause headaches in using it. On another note, everything has also been loading slower than before, like some cache gone wrong."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like the fact that all the photos I take from any device All Inked Up in one spot here in Google photo app. Because of my work I am constantly handling multiple devices and it's easy to forget what photos were taken on what device so I really enjoy the fact that with this app it doesn't matter where or on what the photos were taken on or how they were saved from social media, I have the security with Google photos that doesn't exist with saving your pictures to an SD card!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Excellent app for storing and organising pictures and videos. Sharing with others can be a bit clunky though. I don't understand why a photo or album or video doesn't immediately share at the clock of the button? It seems to take a while for shared content to appear on the other people's Google Photos, and sharing via email is slower than WhatsApp even though the quality is higher."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Terrible interface now via PC and Andriod. You can no longer edit multiple photos and then save the edits. The interface constantly freezes when editing and I have to exit and restart the app. I really enjoyed the old interface. If ain't broke don't fix it. It was working perfectly now it's garbage! Fire the DEVs that designed this awful interface. I actually have to pay for this terrible setup now due to storage issues. I am very unhappy because I edit lots of photos.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The google photos app has been quite effective and dependable since its installation to my phone. However for the last one and half months to date, all photos and videos have disappeared from my phone. I have tried several times to restore them but I have failed. I would be most grateful if the photos and videos are restored to my phone. Please assist."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It is decent.. However I found a huge issue. When trying to organize on my phone or through USB via computer it is extremely difficult to sort files. I wish there was a function that made it to easier to differentiate my files. The most annoying thing is when you take pictures in portrait mode it creates ANOTHER picture that does not have a blurred bckgrnd THEN A FOLDER WITH JUST THOSE 2 PICTURES... FOR EACH PORTRAIT PICTURE. Why?!? Why is each folder individual instead of a folder for portrait?
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app. I use it as a gallery, it‚Äôs very convenient that you can choose which folder to save in the cloud and which not. There is a personal locked folder, which is also quite convenient, since you can hide personal documents and so on from prying eyes. I still don‚Äôt understand how to use the archive, but I use it for my own purposes, so as not to litter the main screen with photos. The app has 2 themes, which is a huge plus since I can't stand the light theme. It has everything you need."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good app I been using it since I got my first smart phone but there is a little issue,when ever I want to download a backup photo it wouldn't download. Pls take care of that"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is a very good , app which stores all the videos and photos in a very systematic & organised manner. Its easier to search for a particular event or video based on the time place and even face recognition. The ways it groups photos is commendable. I also absolutely love the assistant feature that gives you amazing color pops, collages animations and movies. They are a really good way to showcase a particular memory... Its easy accessibility is one of the most helpful feature. Great job google"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love google photos, it is the perfect thing to store photos on any device. I love the easy edit functions, the easy, very neatly orangized/organizable features on it, and how it can back up photos easily for you to not take up too much space with photos. There is only one issue though that I have, and it unfortunately is nothing the app can help. As a photographer, I simply take too many photos. Neither my device storage or the app can keep up. Phenomenal app overall though."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I used to love this app and would have given it 5 stars until the update in late June or early July, which I hate and I regret installing. The update removed a useful features which made it easy to find old photos and videos. ""For You"" tab is gone, replaced by less useful ""Library"" tab. The old Rediscover this Day was better. Now it shows a slideshow of a few of past years' photos (selected by the app) at the top where my folders used to be. The previous version was fine, wish I could go back."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Google photos is a paramount app for me en my partners cox it stores my dataset for so long
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Add the functionality so that we get to choose which screen opens first when we open the app. By default it's Photos. Provide a setting so that we can either set it to Search, Sharing or Library. Showing the Library when I open Photos app is the most important thing to me, because that's where I go 98% of the times when I open the app. It's the most important place, containing Camera, Screenshots, Downloads and everything, so it should open by default in my opinion that would save a lot time."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"My photos app is great when it does work...but after a cold hike did not save a series of 30+ photos I took of time in a cabin in the woods with family. Huge bummer! On the hike however, photos performed great and the camera was amazing. Not sure if this is a bug with the Google photos app or with Android software but either way hugely disappointed."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like that it automatically arranges your pictures into a little montage of memories. Also you can choose which pictures to put in the arrangement and make little gifs! It's really a nice app. Only thing im not to excited about is, its always trying to sell a framed picture or a book. Its a nice option to have but i just don't like it being shoved down my throat Everytime I take a picture!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Display is weird, folders are slow to show updated information, doesn't show duplicates if I accidentally downloaded something twice, so I can't clean up my downloads, how dare you by default try to back up my personal photos on the cloud, and it loses 3/4 of things I transfer from one folder to another. As in, they cease to exist on my device all together. The old Gallery app was better why did you remove it?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's been ok. Would love to see better and easier duplicate picture removal tools. Would like better control of where it pulls photos from and then where they are stored. Not happy that locked folders do not move contents automatically when you buy a new phone, lost a bunch of pictures then. Lost a ton of pictures when Drive and photos divorced and went their own ways. Would be nice to have a higher level of photo editing built into the app. Recent edits/photos folder can miss pics."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The way app is built is disgusting, it contains mainly useless features that work extremely illogically. I lost very important media out of the nowhere while the most insignificant stuff remained. Backup works randomly. Assistant is annoying - isn't there a way it can be disabled forever? Plenty of bullshhh and no visibility of my actual folders. Why not keeping it simple?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Please make it easier to download the entire Google photos library onto the computer/hard drive. Also, I would love to be able to select the type of item Google assist makes. I love the gifs, but do not care for how overly filtered and contrasted the photo edits are. I also can't access certain albums or 'favorites' from Instagram or Mail, which is very frustrating. I can access screenshots, and other miscellaneous folders but not the most important one that has narrowed down my photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Literally cannot download multiple pictures at once.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There is no option to disable uploading of all photos taken with the camera and sync only selected folders. There are work-related photos which should not upload to cloud. The only way is to disable sync altogether but with no sync the app is unusable. I'm uninstalling it and switching to an offline gallery app without cloud sync. To upload photos to the cloud I plan to use web interface in a browser, at least this way I can manually select what I want to upload."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Specifically set it NOT to sync photos when I first opened this. It immediately started syncing all of the photos on my device. Sync option was OFF in settings. There was no way to make it stop. To top it off, the shared album I added to my library was not showing up. Useless and just started grabbing my personal files despite my explicit rejection of the option."

Since the newest update, I've been miserable with Google Photos. It has prompted me to ""update"" it, though I already have several times. It closes and does not allow me access to YEARS of content. It has crashed at the most inconvenient times; though is there ever a convenient time? Whatever y'all dad, you need to fix it, Google. It's super unstable and frustrating."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The latest update has made the app super slow, it's such an annoying annoying experience. Lots of bugs. When I save an album the name doesn't get saved, no matter how many times I even rename it, it keeps on showing that the album is untitled.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google photos is my absolute favorite! I never have to worry about losing any images or video . The search function helps me sort through more than a decade of images! Updates always have new, fun, & innovative functions. The auto upload shared folders help me & my family automatically share photos & videos based on who is in it. Also thank you for adding cat and dog facial recognition. It's a nice feature because our pets are our family and it's always fun to show off photos of the babies!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I had previously given it 5 starts but changed it to 2 now. Did not like the new update. It was easier to navigate the app previously.

One of my favorites is how it will randomly select and edit some of your items and then notify you so you can save them if you like them. It hasn't created anything I haven't loved yet. I definitely recommend this app to anybody and everybody that enjoys taking and editing photos. It's the best!"

It saved all my photos from my past phones and I saw old memories even I forgot about! I would highly recommend.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Used to work ok but now won't display pictures. SLOOOW Why can't I just have a camera and then simple picture viewer that possesses all my photos where I can view them. I have to go through my file folder to see images I could view instantly before. It really shouldn't be complicated to open my pictures quickly and access them without interference from an app. I have to be logged in to see the stuff on my fword phone?!! That's not right. Get it together y'all.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I hate that this is the default app for photos on my phone. So difficult to navigate. When I take a picture, it goes to a album that's separate from all my other stored images. When I save photos or take screenshots, I have to go digging through the strange group of albums to try to find it. Why are there 3 pages in this app? One should be able to tap ""photos"" and the list of albums should show up. No convoluted garbage with a main gallery and a library of other photos. Typical google trash."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I,m thankful that google photos has chosen a platform to remind this individual what is appropriate for organizing photos in an album that is not always private or in security.

I made sure it only had permission to access 2-3 total folders in my gallery. I now see it is accessing all of them. If I choose ""camera"" as one and ""family"" as another, why are photos from other folders popping up in the ""collages"" you create (not welcomed either)? It's very upsetting.

Biggest problem for me is that it takes more than 2 minutes for a downloaded photo to even appear in your album folder. I had to keep closing and reopening to see if it had come through but some photos appear faster than others. It's frustrating. Too many issues to summarize but this is the biggest one for me. Sucks cause it's part of my phone."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I don't like the fact that this isn't a standalone photo app, meaning it has to be connected to the internet for certain features to be available, such as a photo transfer to the lock folder. That sure doesn't make me feel like the privacy of my photos are entirely secure as my phone itSELF, should be handling all the photo business, not capital monsters. Gone are the days when Android phones came with their OWN photo apps, instead of a major corporation run app, such as this. But, it's decent."

I often want to make a quick shot, only to have blurry mess, because the app decided that it needs night mode, even though the pics are fine if I turn it off manually. Which is the worst part. You have to turn it off every single time you start the app, and you can only do it if the tiny symbol appears. What a major step backwards."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have personally organized my photos into folders so it's easier for me to manage and access them. I have personalized my settings too, just to find Google randomly disorganized them poorly and by location even though I have it turned off and I have to hunt down where they have been displaced. It affected my background to change to a default stock photo. There are photos missing from folders and I have to search for them. How do I prevent this from happening again? Why is this happening now?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Google did a great job of convincing their users that they didn't need to worry about storage over the last decade with Gmail, Drive, and Photos. They even removed the 100 free gb they gave me (different account) as a promotion from a few years back. I like this app. It's a good way to store and share photos. I occasionally make photobooks. The photobooks are very bare bones. I mostly continue to use this app out of convenience. I am not convinced that they won't end up screwing me later on."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Handy. I use it everyday in multiple ways! I can take pictures & keep them safe in the cloud access, edit, print, from anywhere. It creates memories & collages by itself & sends me a notification to view them. I can save if I like them, edit, or delete. My memory isn't the best, so I also use it to snap pics of products I'm considering purchasing or information online to refer to later. Often, I use the built in enhancer to increase readability when it's a pic from my PC, TV, ETC."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love that for a lower quality you are able to store photos without using account storage until June. However, one problem I have been having is that occasionally 2 people will get grouped as the same person in my People. But you can't manually make people profiles unless their face is detected in a photo. That means that if 2 people are grouped as one, there is no way for me to ungroup them and make them 2 separate people. Edit: I forgot to mention that I love the movies feature!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After an update a couple of months ago all photos get scrambled when downloaded from Google drive. Even when downloaded 1 by 1. This is incredibly frustrating when you're photos tell a story when they're put together in order. It doesn't sort them by name, date created, date modified, upload order or download order. I have no idea who thought it would be cool to scramble photos at random but it makes the app entirely dis. Please change it back for Pete's sake!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This has made my anxiety of losing photos and videos almost vanish. I've had my phone stolen, and wish I knew of this app then. Now, I have everything going to this app. I have switched phones about 4 times now and the breeze of having all my photos and videos backup instantly is amazing. The extra bonuses like how the Google Photo team will send you animations of photos or edits are pleasing. They don't force you to save it, but usually its fun and I save their suggestions and movies. üñ§ Thanks"

"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Wow the syncing feature can be useful and super frustrating!! Firstly, since this app also syncs unnecessary folders like 'screenshots' & 'whatsapp' stuff, I went ahead and deleted these folders on G photos, only to find they got deleted off my phone as well! Now they're all gone without saving them.. Plus even if you choose the option to 'stop syncing' certain folders, it still syncs them! Would be helpful to at least provide a warning as to what you're deleting off the phone as well."

Would be back up to a 5 if they reinstate it or make the automatic creations easier to find. So far only place I've been able to find creations is in the highlights section. And the best feature (automatically generated movies) appears to not be in the highlights section."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Using this app on the Pixel 4 XL is surprisingly the worst experience I've had with this app, on a Google device no less. The app seems to struggle with moving photos between folders on my device, either appearing as though it hasn't transferred, or that it just duplicated the photos their. And then, the app takes its sweet time to organize the photos, sometimes in a order that isn't chronological. When clearing space, app will delete photos even if inside a folder with back up and sync off."

If I screen record something, it pops up, which is a good thing. But when I try to edit the screen recording, if the video is longer than 7 seconds, it gets really pixelated.

However, I have two suggestions. First, I wish you could sort the photos either by name or by size. I honestly don't like the date and time feature (mainly because it consistenly gets it wrong and is a pain in the butt to change), which brings me to my second suggestion. Please put out an option to change the date and time through the app, and not just the website!"

Can someone help?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google Photos changed my life! I love this app. The facial recognition technology is positively amazing. It correctly identifies faces from newborn to adult. It's not perfect, of course, but I'm hopeful it will improve over time. For example, it doesn't always recognize all faces in a photo and there is no option to identify manually. The good heavily outweighs the bad. I give it 5 stars for facial recognition, search, organization, storage, and sharing capabilities. üî•"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I love some of the functionality, facial recognition, sorting by place, search functionality, all great. However the backing up feature leaves much to be desired. The function to ""free up device space"" does NOT work. I've tried allow all permissions, clearing cache, date, reinstalling, it will not delete photos from my device that are backed up. It also just keeps backing up more and more data. It would say ""backing up 60 photos"", I would not take any more photos, not download any more images and then the number would jump up. Only thing I did was delete images from the Google Cloud, you would think that deleting images would be less to back up. I have to manually copy photos over from my SD card to my computer where the file management system ACTUALLY WORKS. Shame since I'm actually paying Google for extra storage space, maybe I will look elsewhere for my cloud storage needs."

Every time I move pictures on my gallery to albums from camera, google photos adds them, making more and more copies. I don't have time to go through 1000s of photos to delete all the extra copies. Please work on us being able to remove duplicates, because I know I'm not the only person with problem."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've got Android One and this app comes with the phone. LOVE IT! This is my only storage of photos. Making folders/organizing is so easy. We run a farm and of course take regular family photos -- keeping these interests separate is easy. And deleting and archiving is easy too. My favorite feature is that we use this app as a way to stay in touch with the family. Each little family has their own shared folder that the whole big family can view and comment on. It's like our own private Facebook!
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ok, so you¬¥ve got all the fancy new functions, photoalbums, Assistent and bla bla.. but it got too clever, too far, too automatic, too prone to human arbitration. The app doesn¬¥t allow you to for example manually change order of photos. Few really disturbing things: 1) Why the heck when you make an album (upload from PC, photos in the PC are put in PC from phone by cable) are the photos chaotically disordered? They are not in the order of how you took them, they are mixed. Google Photos reads wrong data info of the photos from computer.. Not when created (took), but when last edited. 2) Even worse (!), you can¬¥t manually change the order. You can just go from the oldest, of from the youngest. That¬¥s the problem. The app (or Google, or developers of the app) thing, that they are smarter than you. So they ban the option to manually change order of any photos in any album. In the end, totally useless, anger producing."

However, it seems with the recent updates, it no longer saves all of my pictures like it used to. It's seems like it picks and chooses which ones it should keep. I thought it was perfect the it was, I used to recommend it to EVERYONE, even set it up on several of my friend's phones. I won't be pushing it as much as before."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Strongly agree with most recent comments. Using this app for so many years, since picasa stage. Used to evolve and improve in every update, until the last one. Went backward in UI and ease of use. Missing ""rediscover this day"" collage, which used to be such a nice reminder in one photo. Please return it back. Or i just can't find it. App is still functional and the best around, but downgraded overal apperreance and usage with latest update."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"In theory this app would be great if it worked as described, however, it has become more of a problem than an asset. Photos takes up a ridiculous amount of memory on my phone (6.71gb) to back up my photos when the already take up that much space in my gallery. Photos has to use internal storage. The free up space has never worked on my phone so again I am giving up valuable internal space to store my data locally when I just want it backed up in the cloud."

And you can also delete all the personal photos and videos remotely from anywhere. Believe me, I have seen a person who found her mobile by this."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Nice app - works well! However, it does have one strange quirk: sometimes, it will ""install"" a new photo to somewhere other than at the top of the first section or page, & you'll have to scroll down to find it. Why it does this (occasionally), I don't know. But it gets frustrating at times when you're trying to look for something & initially, it seems like it isn't there. If you're like me & have several hundred or perhaps thousands of photos in Google Photos, that can be a real pain in the ass."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Awful. I don't like this new memories thing at all it's sending me pictures and videos that I deleted for a reason I don't even know how it still has them I was just sitting here having a good day minding my own business and it just sent me a naked video of my wife in the shower that I thought was deleted a long time ago but apparently this app has access to but I do not have access to it I can't find it I can't delete it I can't get it off my memories it's an absolute nightmare.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It has some great editing features but could use a few more. But I like how you can save everything into one area. And you can also save a copy so you can save the original plus what you edited into the photo that you thought would be best so that if you want to print it you can do future edits on the original if you don't like what you did on your phone. So overall I think once with an update with more features that allow some more editing features on there I think it'll be a spectacular app.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app that stores all our best memories and offers many different settings for customizing, viewing, and privacy. Privacy is especially important because I'd like to keep some memories personal and/or private so privacy goes hand in hand with security, which I think is done well in top of the other items listed. How tragic/invasive would it be to lose photos of our most cherished and unforgettable memories through some sort of data breach."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I honestly love this app just because of how it's so easily and very nicely integrated as part of my entire Personal & Professional Google Account Body of Network Information!!! It contains all the basic features one expects of such an app like auto sync, personalization of selection in backing up only selected folders, also how, when, where, and if not to back up on your preferred networks and time. Organize with many customization features allowing to integrate with cloud services & apps!!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Top class app and whole service also. If you compare Google Photos with Dropbox or something similar, Google is 5 times better. Simple, backups everything, you can make albums easy. Search button is also good and it helps a lot. My only issue are storage policy For example, if I buy 100 GB one time in total, then I should be able to use it until if fill it, right? At present terms you're supposed to buy this every single year. Thats not ok."

The app has been glitching and causing the screen to flash like crazy, then locks up the phone. I've rebooted the phone several times but it only happens when I'm using the Google Photos App. I also uninstalled and reinstalled the app and still have the same issues. Ran my virus protection again just to be safe and it shows no issues with the phone itself so it's problems with the app itself."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Like the rest of the greedy corps. They're update now end free unlimited storage. has 1 MAJOR flaw.. It needs to sort photos into device folder based albums. Instead of just scattering backups into ""days"". Also it needs options for removing specific albums from the device, or ""all photos"", ""all videos"". Not just ""remove all backed up media""... If I did that I'd have to sort through every picture or video I ever made based on nothing but the time."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Very easy to use and seamless interfaces. The problems are numerous with the service. Installing this app made the Google cloud the primary storage space for photos taken with the camera which is a major problem. If you want to access the photos or transfer them to a computer, they must be downloaded through their cloud service and then downloaded again to another cloud service and then downloaded again to your computer. The album feature is almost worthless."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app sorts your pictures, gives you suggests on rotations, makes power points with music, and more features. The reason for 3 stars if you want to print any picture you have to pay.. Its a long drawn out process to get the picture to print on your own printer. Hint copy and paste does not work. You have to share email to self then paste to a printable application. I can only do one at a time. Yes I did contact google no response to date (8 months)This is a major draw back for this app."

They make it unbelievably difficult to download your images and videos to a hard drive or laptop etc that you end up with so many, it becomes impossible to ever go back.

I have not explored much into the app to see if you can do editing. Overall, I am happy with the app for my purposes."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Amazon Prime members can get free unlimited photo storage. Google no longer gives you free unlimited storage but they do give you a lot of free space. Additional space is currently cheap but a monthly fee. It's automatic backing up everything so it's one of the most valuable apps for anyone who doesn't want to lose their photos. Melt sure to go into your device settings and uncheck the box that says your phone will turn off this app if it's unused for a long period of time for backups.

I wish I could zoom in on distance shots a bit more, but I love the macro option. And... it's primarily a phone, not meant to be a DSLR. It knows more about photos than I do, so I'm not currently making full use of its capabilities. I'm just happy with what it does for my photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It works but somehow magically also eats all my phone space too? It takes up many gb of space on my phones, which is exactly what I wanted it not to do any more? It's storing thumbnails as caches? I can't seem to clear the cache without deleting and reinstalling. This happens on Huawei honor 8, Samsung galaxy 9, and samsung galaxy tablet... Super frustrating. Other than that, it works and syncs fine! Amazing for free. I can only imagine how much customer profiling info they have on me!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Used to be great. The new update it horrible. My albums are all out of wack and it isn't adding photos in the correct order anymore. I have pictures that are staying at the bottom and anything I add gets put smack in the middle of the album. It's also incredibly hard to find anything I save to my camera roll through Snapchat. I had to upload the video to Photos TWICE for it to work and now it refuses to be added to my album. I had no complaints with the app before this update
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app makes it cumbersome to find photos, and some I can't ever find. It hides my SD card photos. I want all folders visible, not just those on my device. You have to go through way too many clicks to find photos or to edit photos. There is no quick or simple way to crop a photo. Really poor quality app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Google Photos is great at what it does, from editing photos (cropping, perspective edits, and cool color/brightness edits) to sorting (face recognition/automatic detection of things within photos)! While it does a LOT well, Google's decision to make it paid for non-Pixel users suddenly is not good practice. It's they didn't make that mistake, this would be a 5-star review, and yes, I'm a Pixel user, so this doesn't affect me‚Ä¶yet."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google Photos is an overall easy, user friendly app, that can really do a lot to improve your images. Without you even needing extensive knowledge or experience with photo editing. And, if you subscribe to any of Google One's extra storage options (which are all fairly priced) they all include extra photo tools that further transform your pictures into a work of art that looks like it was taken by a professional."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"i absolutely love this app! ive used it for years on all kinds of devices, including my iPhone & love love love!! i have such good pictures from years ago saved that will always be saved and easily accessible because I always use this app. I completely love it and it makes saving old photos easier, without having to worry about switching your photos to new device."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Has lots of features, nice UI etc ... but I had to uninstall it, because every. single. time I connected my android to WiFi, photos would run in the background syncing - with no warning or visual indication - and hog the wifi! It did it to the point where nobody on the whole LAN could even browse the internet if my phone wifi was turned on!! And it wasn't because it was backing up all my photos, I deleted them off my phone so it would stop trying to hoover them all up... sorry, uninstalled."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,After turning off back up and sync Google still backs up created albums whether I want them to or not. A thoroughly irritating and disgusting invasion of privacy probably designed to use up storage space so they can sell you more. I'm effectively deprived of the ability to create albums due to unwanted back up. I'm not the only one who feels this way just read the forums and reviews. I raised the issue with the app creator and just received a link to turn off back up and sync so a waste of time.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Just noticed recently my google photos has not been loading my profile for a while. Would stay on it for minutes but still nothing. I don't have a bad network, what's wrong????"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app keeps crashing. It backs up but I can't look at my pictures, delete, edit because every time I open Google Photos on my Android it only stays open for seconds and closes automatically. I've updated, turned my phone on and off. I'm only having issues with this app right now. So I don't think it's my phone."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Getting failed to bin when trying to delete photos from folders in library view. In response to developer. I'm doing exactly the same as I've always done, before the Android 14 update and the app update. It's not working as it did. Also the choice of words (Failed to bin) is a bit strange. Action failed would be better, in my opinion."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is simple and easy to use(my opinion). Backup feature is very good! I thought i lost my old photos but no! It was all auto backed up and i didn't know. In app photo editor is one feature which saves alot of RAM on the device. Rated üåüüåüüåüüåü because it doesn't have privacy for photos. If the developers of this app could provides private photo album then i think it's all set to receive the *Best Photo App*
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I like the helpful suggestions for slideshows and image editing with filters as well as grouping similar photos together. but I do find the editing to be too basic and the search function to be pretty poor.even when searching for very simple and easily recognisable objects. Google has learnt a few recurring items and people very quickly but still struggles to recognise dog repeatedly
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app was my device's default app on viewing photos and videos so I do not have a choice on using this. At first, the app was normal, but after the update, photos and videos that were just taken are all missing and only appears at a later time. Transferring photos and videos to another folder is also a mess, working like I previously mentioned. Why do you have to update the app just to make it more complicated and a waste of time for us? Please fix this mess."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, it's editing and software is amazing!!! I've been using it for 4 years and don't plan on stopping. Although I have one idea, could the developers make it so that there's a feature which scans for duplicate photos and shows you them so you can decide whether you keep or delete them. As I have to do this manually and it's a huge pain. I would be ever so thankful if Google worked on adding that feature and o hope you all have a good day :)"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The way it stores and organizes photos and allows access is overly complicated compared with when I had an iPhone. It was very easy to distinguish what was stored in the cloud vs the internal storage on the phone, that is not the case here with Google photos when using the Pixel 4XL. Furthermore, you can't select a picture and copy it, and paste it to a different location. Ex: if I take pictures of a car accident I can't copy them from Google photos to the Google drive folder with my claims docs"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"All the photos have the correct date when you click on them but when you search for a date they are all under the wrong. When I search for Christmas photos from last year, those showing as 25th December are actually from the 18th November and you can only see this by clicking on each photo. What I can do in editing seems to vary by picture and I recently had an issue with double of every photo which resolved itself after a day or two."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Many important features are missing here, and many people are complaining about it. 1.) Deleting photo from cloud will delete same photo from phone/computer. 2.) There is no folder structure, so restoring a backup will mix thousands of photos into single folder 3.) I want to backup only ""Camera"" folder, not screenshots and other garbage. It is uploading whole DCIM folder. 4.) There should be icons on thumbnails, for non-backed up photos, to indicate which ones are not in the cloud."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A fantastic way to store your photographs in high quality format. I like the way you can access the pictures from any device you authorise (keeping your data secure). The photos are easy to share with friends and the general public and I really love the way the app reminds you where you were and what you were doing and who with, 1, 2, 3... Years ago. One of the apps that you use without effort and is almost woven into the fabric of life. A go to app for photos and videos. KEEP IT FREE!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It really has a lot of great features! Especially: assembling panorama photos into one big picture, showing old memories, assembling trips. What's missing: in the ""archive screenshot"" feature, you should enable us to delete the selected images because the algorithm selects really good instances of stuff i would just delete. But since I can only archive them, I end up searching and deleting them myself üôÑ"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Love the automatic features. I've had problems with the face recognition, though. After a certain number of people it doesn't remember names or profiles. I've gone through and spent hours identifying photos only to have it forget what I labeled or forget the person. Also, when I change the date of a photo it still comes up when searching the old date (which is usually the upload date, not the date the photo was taken). It would be nice too, if you could search photos by text in the description."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am still discovering what I can do with 100s of pix and several combined accounts, but so far so good. Update: since switching to a Galaxy s10, I have found the pic editing abilities to be wicked limited compared to the Galaxy s8+ I had before. You cannot change the actual colors or hue in a picture only the temp or brightness. Excellent feature is gone!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's good, but there's a few things I think that could be improved. Like adjusting your collages so that they actually show the part of the image you want, it would be really helpful to have a little folder that puts all of your starred images or videos. And it would also be really nice if there was an option to scan through the app and bring up any duplicates for images."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"actually love this and it's intuitive grouping, stylising, movie making and collaging. it's saving me a life time of hours organising my images and if i really care about something i can go edit the creation. without this my images would all just be dumped into one large consecutive unreferencable mess. thanks. also good back up function. much needed assistance all round"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app was good but some months ago idk what happened but It made it difficult to upload anything. And when I try to load the pictures on a different account it takes hours for them to load, I literally leave the app open over night and that's not enough to load them. And when I want to upload anything it never uploads, and when it does it doesn't show up on different devices. This app is broken"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I loved Google Photos, and actually still do since I have a Pixel 4a and unlimited free storage. However, when I have to replace my 4a I'll have to stop using Google Photos, too, because 15GB of free storage is nothing (I take lots of photos) and the paid options are too expensive for me. Plus there isn't even an unlimited option available, which I would need. So, I'll enjoy Photos as long as possible with my 4a. I know I'm going to be very sad when I have to quit using it; it's really great!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New design is terrible and missing functions. The new app doesn't have a way to save photos back to your device like the old one. Most apps don't take you into Google Photos to select your pictures, they instead go off of what is in the photo folder. This literally breaks the ability to post to Facebook for any pictures you took prior to a phone reset!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't like the organization of the app and I don't like that there's not a separate tab or section auto-made animation and movies or auto-effects and filters. Some of my photos refuse to archive and when I edit some photos (even just a simple rotation) there end of being two versions of them that look the exact same (one that says ""original"") even though I don't choose save as a copy. And it incorrectly sorts my photos by date. Utter trash."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google photos is a fantastic program which functions well across both personal and professional photography roles. Link sharing is an excellent way to distribute or share content with clients. The keyword search function is a huge time saver especially for those folks with extensive photo libraries. It's pretty universally compatible, I use it across phones, tablets, and laptops with no issues what do ever. I highly recommend Google photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It was working fine until recent update. The 'move to album' doesn't seem to work for existing albums. Like I can't scroll down to choose the options anymore. I am having to create a new album instead. Pls look into it. Update: I can add into my own shared album. But not to the one shared to me by someone. I think such a feature isn't there yet, so I misunderstood it to be bug. Thanks."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Nevermind new tools, let's keep the basic functions working like access to SD card, ability to see photos from all devices. Come on! I'm having to manually sync on both phones, move everything to the internal storage & then back to SD card using other apps. Please fix this very basic functionality without us having to clear storage & then have the same problem anyway."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,You guys haven't fixed this issue. It still stops and kicks me out of the app.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"For an app that has access to all you upload, I've never/not yet, had a problem with privacy. The link share function has worked flawlessly. Kudos for that alone. As far as cloud storage, ...and access from anywhere (with proper credentials) Again: flawless. Keep doing what you're doing. And, keep your noses, out of our business. Four stars: rarely do I give a five."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Very bad we can't send a file or video to any one it shares link to other which is very üòû
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"One of the simplest and best photo apps out there and it's free, without a doubt governments should leave Google to do their own thing and not interfere as the only people who will lose out are us the end users. Google photos is fantastic and the memories are a great way of not forgetting things, and all for free, and normally in your pocket. Would recommend to everyone"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"On the surface, this is a great app. Very useful for saving my images and videos. That is, until you want more detailed info and services. I'm pretty sure they're in there, but I defy the average user to find and then figure them out. GUIs and user experiences have always been, and remain, the nemesis of the average user. They're just not intuitive. This app is no different in that respect. I have gigabytes of images in my phone, but where they are stored and where the exist, who can say?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"""Unable to edit, check your connection"" I updated, tried changing wifi, using mobile data, and still couldn't edit photos (also have paid Google cloud). To anyone who gets the error, the solution I found is to find the app in the play store. It should show as installed and there is an option to uninstall to the left of the open button. Click on that and it will ask you are you sure and click yes. It doesn't uninstall the app, but the update. Always back up photos but it shouldn't affect them."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love the organization and sharing opportunities that Google photos provides! I've ordered photo books through Google photos and have been thrilled with the book. The quick editing is great. The shared library feature allows my husband and I to automatically share all photos of our family. This is probably my favorite feature. I wish there was a stronger integration with Google Photos and the Project Life app. But that is literally the only thing that I don't absolutely love about the app.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I pressed ""free up space"" and even though it backed up my pics and vids, i lost all the organization (folders) I had. It doesn't tell you that you are going to lose all your folders when you hit free up space. It should clearly give you the options of what folders to transfer and keep everything in tact just as you had it in your phone. I've been putting those folders together and organizing them over many years. Why would I want to unknowingly undo all that work in the press of a button?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Your choices for compilation are undesirable, I can't choose which picture to be each album cover, and I can't organize and group my pictures the way that I want. The locked folder feature isn't user-friendly. Also, I shouldn't have to backup and sync to every cloud on the www,but not be able to retrieve anything when I get a new device. I have lost irreplaceable memories to the cloud in this way, more than once! Also, the edit feature in the paid google1 app is poor!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I think it is great some of the things that get created for me. I come back from a nice weekend away and my phone creates a movie of my adventures. I take some great photos and it edits them to look even better without me having to do anything. The only thing that does concern me is that someone may be viewing all my personal photos as it almost seems like someone is actually doing. However creepy it may be, it does actually give me some awesome slideshows or edits which I will keep more often."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Google Photos is a great app with lots of features. Could improve by adding background remove, text editing and video editing to reduce video length and file size. My biggest fear is having to choose between great software from Google and great hardware from Huawei...given the choice, I would sacrifice great software for great hardware because you can always find alternative software."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"After the last update, Google Photos won't let me move pictures to different folders. I have specific ways I like to keep my media, and now I can't do it because the app won't let me. Edit they asked for: Whenever I try to move my pictures to a different folder, it asks for permission to modify them. No matter how many times I say yes, every time I try to move them, it says there was trouble moving them."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love using this product, but the latest updates ruined everything! The chat feature has been compromised greatly! The other person's picture to whom you are chatting with doesn't slide down in real time letting you know they read the thread. To access the thread tap the notification twice, and open and close the app three times. Also the photos you take with your camera take forever to load to my account. Please revert to the previous version before this update (about two months ago). Thanks!"

The app messes up dates completely sometimes. Pictures taken 20 seconds apart are shown under headers days or months apart despite the right date showing in the info. I have a newborn so it's quite important for memories to show correctly which is just not the case. It used to be so good. Now it feels like Google just doesn't care."

Didn't knew what I would do without this if I have to go to certain date or an event to refer data (pictures). This became the biggest setback as well, as I changed the phone and restored cloud, the entire data got shuffled and it lost it's timeline structure. Pictures scattered and now don't have any order. Kindly help if I get it restructured again. Otherwise very useful app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It used to work great, but as of the last few months it doesn't edit photos in any way well. It looks like it will,until I try to save the photo with the edited changes,and then it just keeps spinning and doesn't show the change for over a half an hour, sometimes I have to restart or completely turn off my phone and then turn it back on in order to view the updated version of the picture with the completed edit."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Wonderful app!! It makes me happy üôÑKeeps my photos safe and in one place & for free! You can edit your photos with this app. Depending on what settings you chose, it will save all the pics you take, recieve, download, & screenshot on your phone/computer/tablet automatically!!! So if you are prone to breaking phones like me, you don't have to worry about losing your photos when you do. I have used this app for a few years now and I haven't been disappointed."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is so cool, it is so intuitive and creates so much cool stuff all on its own and then you can choose what u want to keep or share and what you don't. The best part is the Google photo books, I have already ordered like 5 and I'm sure to order many more. You can take suggested photo books and exit them, add pictures you liked, remove pictures you don't like. Change the order that they're in. Plus all of it is so easy to use. The best photo app ever, hands down"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used to love the app, but they keep changing it too much. It's more complicated now, in my opinion. I don't want to go through three menus to get where I need to be. Plus, it barely uploads my photos anymore. Just keeps giving me a loading bar and icon on pictures even after going in manually."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app used to be fine. All of sudden after several times I ignore the update notification, a lot of photos doesn't appear in google photos, then I tried to update it and return to normal. After that, something worse is happening. The app reback up the file that I already back up. What happened? I hope I can get a proper solution. Thank you."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I hate this app so much, you updated and made it impossible to move photos to folders and them Actually be in the first folder. No, they stay bunched up with All the photos and absolutely no way to access my SD card to put photos there. Worst photo app. In response to your reply, I've done all that, trust me. I've tried to get your app to work to my liking and I hate it. Also, that wouldn't change the fact that even when I put my photos in a folder, they all stay displayed jumbled up."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Could use A LOT of improvement. If you don't want certain photos to be backed up, too bad. Once you delete them on the app, they get deleted from your phone gallery and there's no way to turn this off. The gallery is also littered with blank photos that you can't delete. Overall, the app is way too broken to be a trustworthy place to store your photos. There's risk of the app malfunctioning and taking your photos with it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"it would really be great if you will remove the storage plan and just have a fix price [that would last forever] for a certain amount of storage that we don't have to pay monthly. Also, I suggest that you should put a feature wherein we could select the pictures/videos that we only wish to back up and not back up the whole videos and photos on my gallery."

I have always loved google and will continue to use it. It has saved all of my photos since like before 2015 and I've had no problem going back to them in the future. I also love their photo editing feature. The way you can make certain textures, lighting's, glares, etc... pop out or dim is really cool. It even does it for you! Definitely 5üåü's!"

I was cracking up laughing at what it put together. I'm not the type to edit my photos and make animations, etc. So it just is a nice daily surprise when it does for me! Also I love the highlighted photos from past years popping up showing ""This week last year in 20.."" Just nice reliving memories :) Only problem I have is trying to download my photos to my device. I just got a Motorola Moto Z4, so I'm not sure if it has to do with my phone or just the app. Hmmm, may want to look at that @Google. All in all, this app definitely deserves its 5 star rating :)"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app but recently started giving problems when saving a photo edited using the native editor on the SD card storage. It had been working well (5 stars) until about a month ago. It is unacceptable for a cataloging/gallery app to not be able to manage/use permissions well. As for now, every time this happens, the fix is to uninstall/disable the app or revert the app to factory settings, and then start again. Simply resetting/denying-and-granting permissions doesn't help."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have a problem which is a very annoying bug and other is a misisng feature. 1. The bug is from my single phone all my photos and videos have got backup second time and now they all are double, which is very annoying to see. 2. The most important and missing feature is automatic delete suggestin of Duplicate photos and videos where the app can simply automatically click the second file and uncheck the first and then we can just simply click delete. Boom, problem solved, please include this."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Google photos deleted my whole album. Years of photos gone! I looked up on the web and it seems others has had this issue from years ago and this isnt fixed? It's not right to play with people's lives and memories like this Google, fix it! I never gave the app permission to delete my albums. I never deleted any albums. My album was just there one second and gone a couple minutes later when I go back to it to add some photos. This is ridiculous. I have photos all the way from 2006. Update is bad"

"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy using Google Photos overall, but there is room for improvement. One feature I would like to see added is the ability to view all the folders I've got my photos organized in, and the ability to sort the folders in alphabetical order. I can get to my photos via the ""Library"", but I can't the folders are not sorry in alphabetical order. So I have to scroll through the list until I find the folder I'm looking for. It would also be good to be able to sort them in selectable date order."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's pretty good for organising pictures and videos into a neat pile ordered by date. Although the AI facial and object recognition can be improved and so do the issues relating to it (some faces unable to have names attatched to them or ones with names that were written do not appear, etc.) Google Photos can definitely be improved had it get more options for personalization and improvements to the AI-related systems. Oh yeah and this app deleted most of my photos from syncing and stuff."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Photos on my phone are separated into folder but this app uploads them all into one folder. I tried sorting them into folders on the website and it still keeps them all in one folder. Also it will only recognize a few folders on my phone. No idea why. Waste of money. I'm going back to dropbox which actually keeps my stuff sorted and uploads everything.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Beautiful, options need to be more explained, not every function is obvious. Took me some time to figuire some stuff out. Like those overlay tutorials. Since some options are icons and those icons are not universal in all apps, so the functions are not obvious. Otherwise it's marvelous, the AI that does the albums, animations and collage is nice."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Developers of this app didn't answer my last review here in 9 months! Meanwhile, I still commend them for this very useful app. Three major issues: (1) high-priced storage plans, (2) no options for automatic upload, (3) no detection of duplicates. To solve these and get more subscriptions, I suggest they ADD: (1) a one-off-payment price offer (plan) to existing plans for more affordable options, (2) a feature to select media for automatic upload and (3) a feature to detect duplicates. Thanks."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The fact that their photo backup feature is basically a scheme to get you to buy storage from Google is an atrocity in itself, but my wife - in an effort to free up space so she could continue receiving emails - ended up losing (seemingly) permanent access to many photos from our wedding day and the last 6 months leading up to it. If anyone can get in touch with us to help correct this, I can take this review down, but until then, I want to keep this up as a warning to everyone else!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I don't know why but not all my folders are showing on this app. Some folders won't show and if I decide to move the other files to the folder that is showing, it still won't show on the app"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Its useful. But keeps hanging. Across all phones and devices. It will create an album for you if it want. Won't create if it doesn't want. If other apps can play a shared video with 3MBPS bandwidth, Google Photos will have trouble even if you give it 300MBPS internet speed. I don't know what sort of underlying IT Infrastructure they use that makes it so slow. It needs a performance overhaul!"

"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is good on its own but the most recent update really hindered my experience with the app. I really don't like the new layout of the photos app. I feel the changes we're far too drastic. And there is an issue with the album feature. It keeps changing the order as in recently added to newest first, and it makes everything a hassle to navigate"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"For being such a huge company and ""on the cutting edge"", I can't believe that Google cannot get it right regarding Google Photos. The interface is so subpar, but unfortunately, the easiest way for me to backup my photos from my phone. Yes, I understand it is free, but the simple ability to sort and view is NILL. Please bring back Picasa. Those who created that software were geniuses."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"if there was a rating lower than 1 star, i would put it at that. many people i know including me, have lost years of photos. when we complain to google all they reply is ""nothing is perfect"" when their entire campaign has been on storing photos on the cloud instead of your phone so they DONT get lost or accidentaly deleted. so i think you should all get an external hardrive. they are actually trustworthy, unlike google photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Overall, app is easy to setup and use. Enjoy the free unlimited photo and video storage (note: free unlimited storage does not backup at your original resolution if your photos are taken at max resolution; however, the free backup quality is good). Like having the option to only backup photos automatically if a WiFi connection is detected. Easy to scroll through stored photos and find by month / year. Restoring photos from back to your device is easy. Notifications are not excessive."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it's a great app, but between Google Drive and Google photos I have hard time deciphering switch app will permanently upload/ Save my photos and documents. Fear of deleting photos is huge to me. I upload / access my Google photos / Google drive/ Email, on 3 different devices daily. so I really enjoyed being able to link up everything as one user."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I uploaded one video, and had to turn on sync. Google photos then uploaded everything I had on my phone, and I ran out of google storage, meaning no emails could be sent or received. I turned sync off, and tried deleting the google photos to get space back. But even though my phone was NOT synced any more, it deleted my original photos. They did not have my consent to do so. This is a big flaw, and this is a terrible app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing application. Concise and convinient. Although there seems to be an issue in my app( Mobile: Xiaomi Mi A3).

Please look into the issue!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it's amazing, useful, helpful, and fun! it gives me a lot of choices on how a video or picture can look or sound. and it makes things like movies from my pictures and video's while keeping my videos and pictures used separate from the movies that use some of my photos and videos. i love it! amazing work!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's mostly good. Mainly just annoying when I take screenshots, edit the screenshot as it's being taken, then come and find both the edited version AND the old version, so I keep having to delete stuff. And it's not easily accessible via other apps when I'm trying to share images. But in the actual app, it's mostly good."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app is so freaking terrible. I opened the app and it showed me a backup and restore page I pressed do not backup but then it didn't backup my photos and videos but rather upload them that was so irritating for me because each and everyday it kept restarting the upload process wasting my data slowing down my phone and that made my phone to also drain battery really fast and so I didn't have a choice rather to switch to another phone because of this. Message to Google: Please fix your app!
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I gave Google Photos 5 stars over a year ago, but since then I discovered something that has made it 4. In memories, if I choose a specific date, I see pictures supposedly from that day, but often some dates are mixed up & sometimes the date I'm looking for doesn't show up until the next day - or not at all. While I don't expect perfection, certainly some things Google Photos consider important are not as important as accuracy. I hope they will improve their accuracy on dates & times Thank you allüíñ"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to be my go to photo collection app. Then they started charging for cloud storage. Fine, I stopped using cloud storage and continued using the on device features. But NOW it keeps asking me to backup my photos and when I hit no it just keeps loading and loading and loading, nothing ever happens beyond that point. I'm so sick and tired of money grabber companies. ESPECIALLY those worth over 1.5 TRILLION dollars."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app pick up all the photos on my phone, including all my hundreds of music albums arts work, software thumbnail etc. with no possibility to make it ignore folders. You can't even get around this problem by creating albums because the app doesn't let you navigate to a specific folder to select images. It completely ignore the folder structure that you might have created to organize your photos. The result is a unusable, useless cluttered mess, totally and entirely unusable."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, it's amazing, it categorises everything, infinite space, it's awesome, but there is something I really would appreciate if it was added, being able to select images of someone and saying it's a person and add a name manually instead of having to wait until luck get the AI to categorise him as a person, say I have a dog named max (Which I do) and I have a few pictures of him but Google photos isn't recognising him, fair enough the AI isn't perfect yet, but I wanna be able to just select his pictures and say this is max, and add more pictures manually, And of course the AI Could use some improvement, But apart for that, this gallery should be the default gallery of every known device that needs a gallery, that's how good it is, Bravo for reading all of that."

Tried several trouble shooting steps (rebooting and clearing app data) and eventually reinstalled the app. Photos are still stuck 'waiting to be backed up'. This wasn't a problem before the update."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing! You get free, high quality, and unlimited storage for free! It really helps me save storage on my phone and automatically makes really amazing edits! It keeps my photos & videos safe and secure in the cloud everytime I take a photo/video!

"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The ONLY photos app I use. Always. Easy to use, quick search to all my pictures, very useful INDEED! Quality images. Crop/draw/tint available too.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The September/October update really ruined this service. It's so hard to find things now and I used to love the assistant enhancements and smart collages. Now that's been replaced with recent highlights which are annoying to navigate, nearly impossible to save, and nowhere near as interesting as assistant used to be. Try adding a highlight to an album, it takes so much effort instead of being two taps like it used to be."

I also love the way they do your pictures. I could go on and on but everybody would get tired of reading. Well, I want to add that Google does cute little things like color pop, movements, etc. I just love Google Photos. I also love the way they save it, if you transport it to another phone. ü•∞"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I used to love this app; it did everything I needed. However, it started acting up, so I undownloaded and redownloaded it on my device. Even though I backed everything up before I removed it, after reinstalling it all my folders/albums are messed up and every time I back up photos I lose photos and it gets even more messed up. I don't know how to fix this and it's really getting on my nerves."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really wanted to give it a 5 star... My only issue is the fact that I can't adjust/ change the date. Seems like whatever time it has been registered on my system is the date Google Photos takes; even if the original date is an error (e.g. if you don't set the correct date and your photo taken is saved as taken on 01 Jan 2001, that's exactly where you will find it in the G.Photos gallery :("
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I adore this app. They are improving it. But even if they didn't do anything to this app. I like. It easy to edit picture and videos. It is limited on what you can do, but it does what I need. I don't do fancy just like to take sound out of some videos and crop pictures mostly. This a good app for saving your pictures and album . You can make movies and slide show on here too."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google photos is great. Never any issues and it pretty much takes care of anything and everything you would do or wish to do with your photos. It organizes, gives suggestions on sorting and storing, creates albums and adds new pictures to the correct album, creates colleges, it even takes you down memories lane each day with a group of pictures from an event, holiday, or just to remember... so you are actually enjoying the photos you took instead of them being in a box under the bed."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"More glitches that ever! This used to be a great photo syncing and editing app but over the past few months it started to create troubles. I had to reinstall it 3 times for it work properly. It takes forever to sync, background sync doesn't work, but worst part - l lost a lot of my photos because it showed me as if everything was synced to the cloud and so I freed up space on my phone, but later I couldn't find them on Google photos cloud and there were gone from my phone."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If the option 'Save to SD card' in the stock camera app is turned on, every picture I take is rotated 90 degrees to the left when I view it. If I press on the preview really quick after taking a picture I see the image with correct orientation and the text 'Processing photo' for a short moment. After that the image is rotated. The thumbnail in the gallery app shows the picture upright, but when I open it to show full screen, the image automatically rotates to the left again."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A complaint I have is how easy it is to mistakenly set the entirety of your pics visible/available to the public, like a user's complete contacts list! An effective upgrade would be a 3 step process to make sure it is 100% consented & the user recognizes modifying such action will enable your pic collection visible to the masses. This would help a user like myself who plays around with all the settings of an app to learn it's purpose & what new & updated functions it's capable of performing."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,App update causes video playback to be extremely laggy. The audio progresses as it should but the video is both slow and jumpy. I am being forced to download an update that doesn't work so I can view photos and videos. I have performed all of the usual cleaning and phone restarts and the problem only returns when the Google photos app is updated.

Wish there was a Zero..."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Not a lot of work put into developing this app. Downloaded it because the base editor on my phone didn't have a lot of text editing options and this app has even less, you *can* add color text but adding it is the extent of what you can do, you can't customize that text in any way, you can't change the font, size of font, lay of font, you can't make it all go on one line, they decide how many lines you get, worst app for adding text to photos. How hard can would it be to fix that, really?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Google is worse than Microsoft. Photos is indicative--a storage option (a poor one at that) with zero image editing or file management advantages over other free apps. It's convenient, but this wears thin. Like MS One Drive, backing up to the cloud means you don't locally own your own files (!?!), inconvenient at best, but costly when photos are irretrievable due to Google's lack of innovation or user support. I now do manual backups and researching paid apps I can trust with solutions."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Reached out to Google support to correct issues that I've been having back in March 2023, nearly 4 months later there has been no progress or updates to correct my concerns. I reach out for updates and I'm told that someone will contact me when they have an update. I am unable to share or recieve photos through the photos app and facial recognition hasn't been working properly to sort photos into groups by person. It's very frustrating to have such a lack of support and assistance from Google."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app could be the best one around. It has some nice functions, but it lacks the most basic ones? You CAN'T filter your pictures to see only the ones uploaded in the cloud. I mean, how hard would it be to have a ""All Photos"",""Device Only"",""Cloud Only"" filter? And you can't delete a picture from the cloud without it being deleted from device?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Overall a good application, but a major bug is that I am unable to delete photos/movies for the first attempt. Need to try 3-4 times at least and each attempt takes a min of 5-10 seconds per photo. Very annoying, nerve wracking, and time consuming. From this perspective, I do not recommend. (this seems to be major bug frequently affecting other users too, not sure why it cannot be fixed) Update: Still no change to this major bug despite it seems to affect a lot of users. Very disappointing."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Yesterday I was uploading some of my old photos because the unlimited storage will end on June thia year. I saw two major issues. 1. The photos are not properly arranged as their date and time. A photo from 2018 is showing in place of 2011. 2016 photos are being shown in 2017 tab. But after opening the details of the photos, they show right date. 2. At the end of the photo list, there are some empty squares which seems like corrupted image data. Please fix it. I don't want to lose any pic."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It is very good and has so many features. Espeically the magic eraser.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,After the most recent update the UI received major changes. The home screen is much more bulky with too many buttons visible compared to visible photos. Removed is the ability to swipe up when viewing a photo to see its details. Now it's another 4 button presses to view the same info. Not a setting to restore. The app still displays photos as well now as it did in the past and I don't take issue with limiting free storage to 15GB. 2 stars off because of the user experience becoming lesser.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used ""free up space"" not realizing it would remove all photos & video from phone. No warning, no nothing, they're just gone. No way to undo & no way to save them back to the phone. I can't find a way to save even 1 photo. There should be save all back to phone. Googling yields solutions where there are no such features in the photos app. Only way to see photos now is with an internet connection, not good. It's too slow and eats up entire monthly data. Whoever invented this should be fired."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great photo viewer with loads of functions but it's got one irritation, the cast function seems to have gone (no icon or option), it was there a few months ago when I tried it last but not now. Tried reverting to the factory installed one, clearing cache and Reinstalling the latest version but it won't reappear. Every other app casts with no problems so it's a fault with this one. Fix this and 5 stars will be forthcoming."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very confusing. Edit options minimal. I was able to create all kind of wonderful things using my photos and edit, create options. Now I can't. Can barely find what I want and then can't make the simplest of options. And forget about adding. No way to be artistic at all. Wish you'd have left mine alone. Google updates have progressively taken over and eliminated user choices. In everything they have access to. If my phone begins experiencing any problems after I send this, I will have my proof!"

In the home screen why the photos that has been uploaded and not uploaded, device photos, are showing together. It totally creating mess. Basically it need filters like show only uploaded photos, photos which are not in device."

This means that you can't free up app space, without permeantly deleting pictures. I've yet to find a way to fix this issue and it becomes an even bigger deal as the app reaches its photo storage limit and let's you know that other Google services can be affected by the lack of space, like your Gmail. I can't give a better rating until this is resolved."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Does not allow sorting by file size, date is the only option. This feature is standard on every other cloud storage platform, and its absence here is intentional. It's a dark pattern, and the intent is to make it harder for users to manage what they've uploaded, pushing them to purchase higher tier storage subscriptions rather than deleting files they don't need. The new ""free up space"" feature is a sorry substitute, and surely required far, far more work to implement."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love Google photos, but I hate that I can't easily move large groups of pictures to an album and simultaneously archive those same pictures. The search functions are great in that they usually allow me to narrow down my search to a date range even if it doesn't find what I'm looking for. I would very much like to see an easier method of organizing my pictures such as drag and drop to move to an album. I don't want the majority of my pictures all jumbled together. Am I just missing something?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"One neat little feature that could be added is the ability to segregate the photos stored online by the folders they were uploaded from since the begining. For eg, if I have photos uploaded at different times, which were edited and exported using Snapseed, I should be able to see all the photo that were ever uploaded from that folder."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"For me, this is the most important app I ever used. I was struggling eternally with my photos and videos before I found this brilliant, brilliant app. Everything, from editing photo and videos, storage management, creating albums, presentation, searching and accessing from anywhere / any device.. Brilliant. Thanks for Google, the company that genuinely understand what people need before they realised by themselves."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There's always some kind of a bug. I report it and after months they repair it, and an another one shows up. Currently, moving images to a different folder doesn't remove the image from the folder I moved it from. When I try to delete that photo or move it again, it just says there's a problem with the file. It's very annoying, especially knowing that when they fix it (if they do) a new bug always shows up."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"for some of us, photos is our primary image viewer. The way Photos is structured is such that the obvious delete icon deletes permanently from the Cloud whereas the rational intention is that case will be to delete from the device.

I have a bad habit of dropping my phone in water. when it happens I know I can back everything up super fast before the phone dies. The thing I CANT STAND trying to upload photos to social media. Take Instagram for eg. It only ever give you one option on how to share it. It will only let you share it to Story. The next day it will only let you share to Feed. Sometimes it gives you a drop down menu (which AMAZING) and that's what I want ALL the time!

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"it doesn't have an ability to put folders into albums. say that i went to a trip to california for a month and wanted to separate the photos i took each week. so i make an album called ""california"" and within that album, i make folders called ""week 1"" and ""week two"" you can't do that. so if you have an album with over a thousand photos, good luck.

I've read that it's from not waiting long enough after taking the photos before locking the phone or switching apps but that is nonsense. Please fix!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google photos is very great and useful till tomorrow. But there's a feature I think should be included in the photos app. For example, duplicate videos and photos!. I suggest there should be an inclusion of the option to delete all duplicate videos or photos on the Google Photos app. Whether backed up or ok device, there should be an alternative to delete any duplicate so as to avoid mixing photos up.

You don't need to scroll and look for a single photo, all you need to do is say about the photo and its here. Loved it"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New update absolutely ruined the app for me, the helpful Assistant that allowed me to browse and share with my family what happened 'on this day 2 years ago' has gone and been replaced by a godawful sideshow, which decides for you at what pace you want to view your memories, is fiddly to navigate (swipe left to go to the previous picture you didn't get time to look at? No! We'll start showing pictures from the previous week!). They have also introduced additional steps to sharing. Rubbish."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible app, it is unfortunate that Android users are coerced into using it. After backing up a photo, there is simply no way to remove it from Google's cloud storage without also deleting the photo from the device. Turning off syncing of folders is useless, since if a photo is backed up once, it's backed up for good, even if it's in a folder with sync off. Feels like the app makes it intentionally difficult for users to get away from using Google photos after they start. Beware."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,A simple feature as cropping a video turns the saved video into pixelated garbage. I can't believe this hasn't been fixed yet. There has been at least half a dozen updates since I first sent a report about this. I can't be the only one that is getting this problem or nobody gives a shitto fix it. I'll stick with Samsung gallery photo editor it works fine.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is super awesome except for one thing that internet connectivity is sometimes slow and it takes time to upload or download photos and videos. Please fix this problem. And also most of the time the photos or videos shown in the app are not updated even if trued, that is if I record a video via camera or screen recorder, it takes too much time to be able to see it in here. I have to go to file explorer to view the recently made videos or captured photos. The problem isn't with my phone."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Finding the exact video you want is actually hard, for example if I want to find a video with a certain subtitle it doesn't pop up at all. I just keep finding another way which is actually hard if you find a video where they wrote something like ""This should work"" as a subtitle, Google photos won't give it to you even though you've backed it up"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Great. I got a new phone and decided to see if anything had changed and it got worse. Now not only will you be unable to access your photos if you don't want to update, it now has ads for google one built into it. I'm putting the alternatives I use on this device and any other devices in the future. If I disable the app then I can't use it. The ad problem isn't notifications, it's the ""try this feature with a free trial of a subscription to google 1"" built into the editing options but thanks."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I love google! but it's impossible to stop photos from being synced automatically to all accounts you have, even if it says, ""backing up to a different account."" it still syncs your photos to all accounts connected.

Especially for me, since I tend to lose things ALL the time. I can edit in the app, I can edit videos as well. Though, there are much better options for editing on Google play, this app definitely is an overall well designed app that helps the greater good, maintains images and memories of the past, and brings nostalgia. Only downfall, not much storg. space."

Easy editing of photos (filters, crop, brightness, gamma etc)."

You can't tell which ones you have added to an album and which ones you haven't. Also I added a bunch of photos to an album, and they got synced with the cloud. And I though they were safe, so I removed them from the photos section, they got deleted from the album too, and I lost them forever."

But yes, if you have a week internet connection, you are on a very weak Wi-Fi signal, you are out of your phone provider service area, then it takes time to actually upload if your barely getting, maybe 30 kilobytes per second. But if you have a good signal, and you're getting at least one or two megabytes per second, then uploading videos and pictures is smooth."

Hate using this app. Mobile version has no option to adjust album viewing. 0n my phone I can zoom out and see many pictures at once, but on Google I can see maybe 4. This is absolutely awful when sorting through large amounts of pictures I use for creative reference. As soon as I find a better app I am moving. I pay Google extra for the cloudspace and hardly use it because it's just so terrible to move through. Try to find something else before transferring your photos"

I just met a man that did a master reset, and lost all of his photos. He wasn't even aware Google photos existed. My ‚ù§Ô∏è heart broke for him, he was devastated. If he had only known. So sad.

Yes, the DCIM issue, but come on - it should be possible to have fine-grained control over exactly which folders are backed up.

No longer gives the option to remove duplicates, no longer have the option to add on YouTube, all controls for editing except rotate have dissappeareds udderly, and as of yesterday if I'm reviewing a video and try to open options the entire app shuts down.

It's not clear which folder or album they are saved to. Also I'll take a picture and it may take up to 10 minutes for it to show in the photo album. That's such a huge lag between the camera and the software. The search feature is pointless; it never brings up what I'm looking for so I still have to scroll. Impossible to search by date when the photo was taken. This app is trash."

Pictures I take, screenshots, and other photo items sometimes never appear where they should. Photo editor works sporadically.

I learned in retrospect how to eliminate unsightly margins with symbols before sending them into permanent storage. Even so, there's still an option to correct for this after downloading your pix. I really love the chanxe to add effects, emojis and text to them as well, and in an assortment of colors and shapes.

It often flags photos I want to delete but you can't do this straight from the playback. You have to search for the photos separately after it finishes. And the hide person function doesn't work properly as it keeps showing people who are meant to be hidden. Having tags on photos, like Facebook, could help. I have followed the instructions. It is the app functionality that is the problem."

I wish when switching to a new phone, your music and photos would transfer into the original albums and album names instead of transferring all your photos to another decide and everything gets thrown together into Google photos.

I even order prints and the quality was well above other local options. Even an old iPhone 5s print at 5 x 7 was stellar. It's the best."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Usually it's a fine app, but I haven't been able to edit any sort of video that I've taken myself at all without the app crashing or saying it was unable to save changes for months now. I've kept the app fully updated so I can't understand what it's issue is. Everything else about the app is good for what it is, but this issue has become insanely annoying."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The creation section was really useful (though sometimes the videos would not get saved) and the recent update was not helpful at all. The video that I see in the editing mode is not the same as the one that gets saved. The transitions are rough and the videos are displaced in relation to the music. Please, take a look at it"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Memories get lost when photos do, The app were doing perfectly well already. It used to be excellent. Now people who relied on it are being let down, they can't get their photos back if it's been in the bin too long even if they had a lot in there, too many to attempt to restore. I got space now but no photos they are all gone. The app isn't trustworthy like it started out to be."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google, thank you so much for Google Photos! I just had a major mishap while attempting to transfer the majority of my internal storage to sd card on my zte blade. The phone reset during transfer and i lost ALL pictures, videos, downloads, documents, etc. including pictures of my children and family. When I thought all was lost I thought to check this app knowing it may have saved some. Thankfully modt of my pictures seems to be there and i am so grateful! Thank you!!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I would love if you're photos would not over take the camera storage in my Android with your automatic back up. I don't want to use this feature as I shoot a lot of photos and i like to edit, delete and save to one of my Gmail drives in various folders. I was going through some photos via your program tonight and it started automatically backing up my photos to Google photos.... ugh...no I can't turn it back off. This total integration is not what I want to use."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Many good features could easily be brought to great. Many have mentioned that certain options are only available in certian screens. This needs change. Not only that, but when clearing out storage you cannot manually select files anymore you just have a button. Quality is important to me and I would like to ensure my photos that need to be in quality are such, same to 4K videos before the original, full quality version, is deleted."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I like the fact that this app gives you storage and makes it easy to back up photos. However be aware that it DOES NOT allow you to download photos from years ago in your memories. That way you ""have to"" by photo books and other items from there store. Other then that it's a nice easy app. PS ...the only thing I've been able to figure out is to screen shot those old photos I want to re load on to my phone. Maybe I'm wrong ...and if so , someone please tell what I'm missing or doing wrong"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The markup option for editing photos is not nice. there are very less colours and size of the pen or highlighter cannot be changed. I cannot blur photos and there are very few filters and no stickers. Samsung's gallery is much better than this app. That app has all features. But, as this is a realme device so it is not having Samsung's gallery. So please add these things in this app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best photo app out there, unlimited storage with decent quality (it would be perfect if they increased the video quality to 4k60, but that's fine tho). Assistant does a great job creating short movies, collages, etc. Albuns organized by people via face detection is great when you wanna search for a photo of someone specifically. Couldn't recommend more."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"1) No option to automatically ""find multiples"" of pictures to erase the excess. Due to the apps lack of clear information, I now have 3 to 4 multiples of hundreds of photos and have to go through and erase each one individually! 2) Constant warnings that I am running out of storage, do I want to pay for more or manage it. But when I go to manage storage and press on ""free up space"" google deleted 2/3 of photos from my device (where I had plenty of space) and not from google storage!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have given this app one too many chances. Today, I'm done with it. So many kinks that have been going on for YEARS that they can't seem to resolve....but this is about the 5th time I created a movie from saved photos and videos that would not process, no way to download, even after hours of waiting. It's incredibly frustrating. To go through and collect all these photos took HOURS. Now I have nothing to use for my husband's bday. Thanks! üòí"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Even though I am connected to WiFi, it has refused to sync photos on my phone to my Photos account. Interestingly, this started happening once the announcement was made about storage limitations starting on June 1...but anything before then is grandfathered in. Its just a little hard to be grandfathered in when you make it difficult to allow syncing before then! Very disappointing! UPDATE: Cleared data with no difference. Tried going to both links and it took me back to Google homepage."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm so absolutely frustrated with this app. I usually am very satisfied with Google's anything, but I've updated this app and it still hasn't fixed it. All of my pics and vids are there with the correct dates and everything laid out, except almost every single picture is just a gray square. My pictures won't load ever! There are a select few pics that always show up but that's it. Over 400 pics and vids and I get to see a handful. And yes they're all ""backed up"" and gone from my phone now..."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Organizes photos in a nice and simple manner while also allowing for ease of use throughout the super handy UI. I can easily select photos and create links for others to view and even search through photos for certain friends. If a picture needs adjusting, I can easily export to my favorite photo editor. The app also has the occasional automated creations which are actually sometimes interesting and cool. The app also shows you the photos and memories from past years for younto reminisce."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good app but there's still room for improvement. The good: I like that Google photos and Google drive finally act independent of each other. The not so good: organizational hierarchy still confusing. Also, when I open Google photos I can view and sort my pics into albums I create yet when I am texting a photo to a friend and open Google photos from my built-in Android text app my albums aren't there. Huh!?! A mantra of mine: Genius is not making the simple complex but making the complex simple"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My videos, saved directly on my phone, will not play properly anymore. I have to open them in another app to view them. I have plenty of storage space and have been trying to fix this for over a week. I'm incredibly frustrated! These are not backed up, I literally take a video and it plays back incredibly choppy. It was working fine then one day it wasn't."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app is only good for storing? Why can't I edit the photos? What kind of app is this? In response to your response! I shouldn't have to go anywhere else outside the app to edit! Deleted and installed Google gallery.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I like that I can look for photos by the people in them. I should be able to manually tag or remove a tag from any photo or video but some you can't. App still mixes up my sons even after tons of manual tag correction and they do not look much alike. The newer way of displaying memories like a story/slideshow is confusing when I want to pause or go back to a previous photo.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Some of the new updates are really annoying. Whenever I crop an old photo, even from years ago, it'll show up at the very top instead of where the original photo was. I don't want old photos mixed in with new ones. I also can't upload photos in the background anymore, which makes the process much slower and therefore impossible to back up all the photos I want to."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Google Photos. The fact it keeps all my photos and videos neat and orderly and has so many ways to edit, share, and have fun with the pics. The auto photo enhancer is pretty cool too. It will send you a motion picture of multiple pictures taken quickly. It creates collages and fixes blemishes. Sometimes adds other effects to create cute additions to your original photo."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Trusted this program, but the last 4 days it stopped working and keeps crushing on my phone all the time, as soon as I go to my photos, I can only see some icons of my photos and videos for a couple of seconds. The all problems started with its automatic update to the version reliased on 8/27/2019 It is terrible, when being on vacation you keep making videos, run out of memory space, and then just find out that you trusted program doesn't upload anything to you paid google cloud!!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Thank you Google Photos for saving ALL of my prescious moments that I've captured over the last couple of years! I lost my phone, but I still have all my photos. It use to be, if you loose or break your phone, you also lost all your pictures along with it. 2 of my favorite features are ""Now & Then"" and the ""Automatic Collage"" I love getting notifications from this app, because I can't wait to see what my ""assistant"" (yes, you get an assistant) puts together 4 me."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Buggy! Move to archive a photo, instead of showing the next photo, skips and shows the second photo. Free up space, does not remove all photos / videos that are backed up. Quality of videos backed up with the free subscription is really bad. Recorded a full HD video, backed it up, and deleted the video. When watching the backed up video, was fully pixelated and unwatchable. So disappointed! Created a photo album to auto detect. No new photos added to album even though person identified."

I can't find notifications you've sent me about photos, you've stopped creating landscapes and movies from my albums. I totally changed how I used my phone to take camera when Google photos was good!

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You can't actually move photos to a folder, they're just copied to it so you now have 2 of the same taking up space uneccessarily. Its nearly impossible to find archived photos after ""freeing up space"". I hate this app but as per usual it comes preloaded to the device and connected directly to the OS so you can't delete it even if you wanted to. It's Google though so they do what they want"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's hard to delete photos and videos. It often comes up as failed to delete. But then the app keeps complaining that I don't have enough storage. I think they're just purposely trying to make you pay.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app used to be good. Now it's all slow and crashes EVERY TIME I try to free up space. I'm so annoyed by it. And I cant even open up the animations or collages or anything it notifies me about. I looked at the article and conversed with Google people and the problem still wasn't fixed üò´üòì Still crashes. Still can't free up space. Followed the article. Did nothing. Google people didn't help.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Recent change to the edit interface is disappointing. Previously a selection of different sliders on screen at the same time made it quick and easy to refine images and make minor tweaks between different parameters. The new layout with parameters that you have to scroll between to adjust is much less intuitive, takes much longer and I think results in less quality editing because the user is less inclined to scroll back and forth to make minor adjustments. Update with toggle for old UI please."

All my albums are a jumbled up mess, can't sort by alphabet. Can't select multiple photos within an album to share on Facebook, just the optionnto share a link. I think because they're not really in albums but file directories now. Can't seem to move pictures into other albums or mass migrate. I hate Google photos!!!"

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Google have removed the ability to select all photos in an album. I've no idea why they would remove this very basic feature that nearly every photo viewing app since the turn of the millennium has had. On top of that, the new inferior album layout design and the redaction of unlimited storage, I'll be using a different app from now on."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Lack of options are designed specifically to inconvenience the user and prevent them from using local storage at all or switch to another service. Horrible, can't download in bulk, metadata forced to change, bad design. Just do yourself a favor if you aren't using Google photos, never start. If you ever want to change apps/services later, the headache will be massive and in some cases it will be impossible to get your files back the way they originally were. So stupid."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really like this app, automatically backup for my photos. But what i did not like is that there is a button for stop syncing photos on mobile data, but it is not working. I lost a lot of data, thinking that i did it and it is not syncing. But after investigation, it was not working. Guys you have to be careful from the features you provide and it is not working."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The change in how you edit photos is frustrating because it moves my edited photo all the way to the top.. I want it exactly where it was. Also most of my photos aren't showing up in other apps like Facebook, Messenger or messages, so I can't post or even send them. Photos is the most important part of my job and I can't even do it correctly because this app keeps messing things up."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"""Can't share album, please try again later"" error constantly. Also the app always has to be open when uploading photos. Will not work in background. And the worst part is the uploading gets interrupted midway, all the photos you waited for to be uploaded just disappear. I am paying for the service as well but the app experience is horrible."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Worst app EVER!! Google makes it so hard to understand, they do not describe anything in enough detail for even tech savvy people to know everything it does with your photos, and once you start to use the backup feature, it DELETES your images off your phone and then backs them up to the cloud. If you have any images that you don't want everyone you know to see, i am warning you now DO NOT EVER USE THIS APP, do not allow it to ""sync"" your data."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love all the new automation, albums, styled, etc. The UI is lacking to say the least. Switching pics between devices is a pain. Doesn't seem to be any other way to combine albums than to manually search thru all photos to find the ones you want and add from there. A frustrating task when you have as many photos as I do. Not too worried. I think within in the next or two they'll have the features that I'm looking for. When they fix these issues I'll gladly comeback to revise"

I don't know if this is an app issue or some other setting but it's always been like this with me. Would be nice if it did it automatically when connected to wifi. Yes, that setting is on.

When I download new images there are blank broken files created that only show up in this app, not in file manager, videos almost never appear anymore, and some pictures I've noticed are going missing. The ones left are getting moved around at random, out of order or the wrong date. I had one picture saved in July say it was from Jan 2022 later after saving. No other app has these discrepancies."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"As much as I use this app & rely on it for safe keeping of my photos, my overall experience w/ it has been frustrating. The organizational system is confusing, why do the photos duplicate when I add them to a custom made folder? I like to organize my photos myself, I've finally realized this app works better when I let it do the organizing for me. Also, this past week my photos are showing on the wrong date, for Ex: If taken on Mon it displays it on Tues instead, only some photos are affected."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Google Photos has always been amazing until the last two or three months. Now the app doesn't organise the photos by the date the photo was taken. They all are in random orders - ""January 2020"" actually has November 2019 photos etc. Scrolling through the photo stream is also an issue, photos don't show up and things are missing. This is the one place I store all my photos, so it's quite distressing that it isn't working properly any more."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Unreliable by design and due to bugs. Duplicates my photos like crazy. Shows incoherent information in different views of the same content. Reverts my chances of all sorts (at both picture and album level). Makes it impossible to organize photos manually to my taste. Does not support checking to which albums a photo was added: in fact, you cannot even check whether a photo is added to any album. Sucks if the connection is poor, hanging on most operations and not allowing to cancel them."

I checked to see if there is an update available for me, and there is not.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I think Google photos is a very good app. I do think it has room for improvement. When it asks you about archiving a group of photos, it should give you an option to delete instead. Some photos are taken by accident, or are no longer needed. So, when you're reviewing their suggestions, it would be nice to have the option of either archiving or not, or deleting it. Then and there. Currently, we cannot do that. We have to exit that review, go back into Google photos, locate that photo, then delete"

Very annoying layout, no customisation or personalisation available. Very difficult to find old photos that were taken on other phones because nothing is in order and for some reason everything has been shuffled around. It's very ""iPhone"" ish..."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Stupid. Backs up every photo you take and you can't have some photos that aren't uploaded to Google. They expect you just archive those. Even if you make an unsynced folder and move the photos you only want on your device into that folder you still can't take it off of Google photos without it deleting it from your device. Astonishingly bad.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app could not be worse if they tried. No ability to browse the folders on my phone, so all pics are dumped in 1 place. Weird ""conversation"" feature beautifully highlights how horrendous the state of messaging and sharing is shockingly horrendous within the Google ecosystem. Drive and photos essentially don't communicate at all. Mass selecting of photos has a poorly implemented rip off of Samsung's swipe select (don't care that you stole it, but it sucks). Least intuitive app on my device."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app has been pending for hours. Google relocated all my pics from camera gallery. I believe on drive but won't open. Been saying downloading for weeks. I don't like Google control everything on our phones & computer. Even email accounts. They even messed me up with email accounts.

A place to click with ability to ""manually clear"" the fuzzies as best possible. Preferably, within the 3 bar lines underneath pic. May be all that's needed. Simple is more. No interest in app's automatic suggestions. Thanks"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app couldn't be worse. Most of my pictures and albums created using the default gallery app on Samsung don't even show up. I usually have to take a screenshot of a picture so that it shows up under recent which then eliminates the original date it was taken. Go through all that trouble to create an album so that I can play it on my Google displays which are also junk, then more than half of them don't show up on display. If I look at the album it tells me there are far less then there is."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Helpful for the most part. Functionality hesitant and not secure a few times leading to loss of memories or important info but can happen to any app regardless.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"If a photo is moved to a folder, it should only be found in that folder. Some sort of image recognition software would be nice because it takes so freaking long to find the picture you want. There should be an easier way to search by what it's an image of, e g., people, horses, dogs, plants, etc. Finding a specific saved image shouldn't be such a huge time sink."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Recent update changed nothing, edit a photo and your edit end up in a separate folder. It still sucks!! You can longer edit and save it in place. Instead, the edit goes to a photo folder. So when you want to use a photo for most things you aren't allowed to go to your folder. Why not change it back to the way it was? You edit your photos and leave them right where they are? Why add another step to the process? Last, if you try to text from photos you can only send to one person, what's up"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely trash. One star is far too generous. There is no option to view files in a list format, or with titles under thumbnails. You have to open each video and go into options bar to view a title, which takes way too long and makes you dig for ridiculous amounts of time to find the desired file. I wish I could give negative stars."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Often it behaves like a yo-yo & when I wish to attach a photo to messages gives limited number of photos instead of enabling me to chose from any of the albums as they are not shown,thus I have to rely on its limiting choices. Sadly, that conveys to Me a rigid design instead of the use of lateral thinking development, which wastes my effort of placing each photo in a designated, by Me, album, but not what the app's developer decided. It's really a very frustrating for me experience to use it !"

I love the app but I'm sick of Google not even bothering to add a simple button that would let is manually start the sync process. I pay for 5GB's a month of storage space and I would like to use it more easily."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Hopeless for private pictures. It brings up random pics from all kinds of apps, and those _can't_ be hidden. -- Locked Folder is terribly unhelpful. The only way to use the private photos is to move them out of the locked folder, then scroll through your unlocked photos to find it. Oh and remember to come back and manually move it to the locked folder again at some point. And because the locked folder doesn't support backups, what am I supposed to do when I get a new phone?"

I have turned off backup and everytime I delete a photo, it deletes it off my phone also. I have read every forum possible to turn off sync, but there isn't anywhere to turn it off. I just want to disconnect it all together, but don't want to risk it deleting all the pictures on my phone. Make it stop!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app makes it impossible to share anything. spent hours making a photo video and it wont let me watch it. Once I hit save, it takes it back to the finalized video but when I hit play it takes me back to the edit page. I sent it to family and and they cant open it. Such a waste of time. The app is great if you dont want to share any of your photos."

This app came pre installed on my phone. So I don't see ads but I also don't get some options in the editing feature like ""blur background"". Many items in the editing feature are paid options if you upgrade the google storage."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Google forces permission to view photos on your phone, so that you can view the photos youve uploaded. If you dont give this permission, it will not allow you to access the app, with only a grey screen and a prompt to 'go to settings'. For a big company like Google, youd think theyd know better than to force intrusion to view content on your phone in order to access features that have absolutely nothing to do with that. Absurd."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Puts everything on your phone into your Google account and then says your storage is full and you have to buy more. You go to unsync it so you can keep the photos on your phone and delete it from your Google account and it won't work, if you delete it off Google it still deletes it off your phone even if it's unsynced. Bullcrap trap."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app since 2013 and they're always been a hiccup along the way but for the last 2 or 3 months, I've been unable to sync and backup. To make it worse, I also uninstalled the app and downloaded it again and everything is worse, only can get photos from 2019 up to today whilst the app continues to tell me that it's setting up my photo library. Google, get your act together and fix these problems!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Just love how I can always get a new phone without worrying about my photos being transferred or deleted. I can always re-download my photos ok my phone or computer since I use them for school or just backgrounds.

Not clear as to why I just updated the latest version of the app. Other features seem to be working and I like the movie I made and was glad after a little playing around I was able to sequence the pics and choose the music I wanted in the background."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've wasted hours trying to create photo movies on this. It frequently won't save video edits included in your movies. It allows you to include them in your creation but then won't save them. Literally hours wasted. Also whilst you can add more than 50 photos by editing the video, once again it struggles to save them. It's put me off using Google photos as a back up for all my photos. I'm surprised at the low standard given this is Google. I'll be looking elsewhere to store & back up my photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Pictures kept disappearing even with sync turned off. It uploads pictures from albums I turned the sync off too, and it didn't matter if I deleted a picture either from my device or the app, both disappeared. I feel this is only happening to my account and it's really frustrating. I think this app had good intentions in saving our memories, and I would continue use if they can fix this problem."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Not a bad app, except the I have auto update of apps disabled and updates my apps when I want (believe me I have a good reason for this). This app constantly harasses you about updating it. If I get into it 20 times in one day it will asked me 20+ times to update it. If I switch screens and go back to it, it'll ask me again. Got so tires of it I have disabled the app and using something else. Good bye and good ridden."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,One of the best app there for android photos and videos. It reminds us of the memories that we had on the same day earlier. It styles and makes collages of our images automatically and upto the perfection. Even the editing options that comes with google is plain awsome. I enjoy using all the features that it has to offer. Face recognition and grouping of pictures is amazing.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Barely works after recent updates. This used to be the best photo app on the planet. In the last few months it has become nonfunctional. Cloud backups hang forever. Tabs like albums or Assistant take so long to load they might as well be broken. Sharing hangs so long before populating with options that it's unusable. I tried clearing cache, reinstall, etc. All that did was cause google photo to re-sync duplicates of 16,000 photos on my phone to the cloud & of course there's no way to fix that"

"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app with excellent editing features. Five stars minus two for the upcoming change to limit the amount of photos stored. What's next, charging for Google searches or uploading a video to YouTube? I don't mind if Google Photos becomes a paid service, provided that I can opt out of the gathering of my location and search data and the sales of the same to others. You can't have it both ways (charging fees and collecting data/advertising)."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's decent, but the amount of problems it creates are too much sometimes. The main one i face is that if i ever open the app on a different device, the photos just won't load. The website works much better. Of course, zooming, etc is hard too. Deleting photos on just the app and not on your phone? Almost impossible. The problem is that it doesn't consider what problems daily users will face and fix that. However, it does have some awesome features, my favorite is how it categorises by face."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app show not working in this version Solve this issue. When I open application and click on edit button then it close the application. and now I m not able to edit a photo .
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Intrusive. Uploads every photo you take regardless of settings. Should be a separate folder/function for upload. I would like an option to decide before a photo appears on Google server. I've taken pics on one phone w/sync off & they appear in photos on another device. I don't want pics of auto parts, nutrition labels, rashes, whatever in Google photos feed."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Some very annoying bugs. I suspect a lot of the problems comes from the app trying to sync after every action like adding a photo to album or creating an album because it always freezes when I add a file into an album. Also please make it compatible without network. I really don't like making an album during a trip only for it to disappear because it didn't register it without WiFi or data.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Bought google pixel 8 pro. Now I'm missing ""portrait light"" feature in tools. It just disappeared after an update. Very disappointing."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Forced updates. Editing about to be behind a paywall. Horrible syncing capability. Forcfully re-arranges albums to what IT likes. GIFs and videos often messed up. No desktop app. Drive and Photos can't even talk to each-other despite using the same storage. No tag support. Sometimes deletes descriptions and albums. And now its main draw, unlimited high-quality photos, is going away. Google photos has officially become worse than almost all its competition. I'm switching services."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It is very helpful in the sense of its storage capacity specially for all phones with a low storage space. My only concern is that the photos that had been backed up in Google Photos does needed an internet connections to see the photos and when the pictures are deleted/free up space on the phone it's difficult to see the photos without any Internet connections. Throughout this application I am satisfied with its work.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"*Edit: this app still constantly loses access to my SD card. When I restore access after the 3rd or 4th try it doesn't move pictures, but copies them. When you ""trash"" the copy, it trashes both copies on the photo. When you restore it deletes the photo entirely. I know Google doesn't like people using SD cards for whatever reason, but thanks to your being greedy and trying to get your grubby hands in all our belongings, I've lost 100's of photos. Thanks a lot."

Please fix this. Thanks."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Great when it works aside from crashing after I delete uploads while in the Recently Added section. Unfortunately, every-so-often the app just doesn't like to work properly; this time, it stopped backing up my pictures despite saying the process was underway, and now it's turned into a whole thing where it's trying to back up tens of thousands of pictures and videos that were already backed up while missing albums and whatnot I previously had...which are still accessible on other devices."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Color/lighting changes once I view a photo. Soon as I view photo in Google Photos, after approx 0.5s (half second), I see photo as: 1. How it was originally taken; or 2. how I have edited it with a filter or whatever tool. After that 0.5s, the photo loses light and color (perhaps color profile changes). The results are simple the photo looks washed out (light/color decreases). This did not happen until the update issued on approx 7-25-2019. Update 10-27-2020. Things are running smoothly."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used to have 5 stars on this until the latest update: it made editing photos take 4x as long, it takes a lot more finger movement, and it's just less user friendly because you must open each individual slider menu just adjust the value. And you can't see all the information presented at once, you have to scroll. Please revert this change or have an option to switch to the original editing menu."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The Best! Google photos is a life saver! Big point - last three phones I've had and broken I have never lost any photos from because of Google photos! It automatically backs them all up! In addition to this the app makes videos out some images - making slow moving videos of actions it's great! It creates 'stylished' photos which look lovely too also gives reminders like Timehop! Oh and it produces love collages! And when switching phones it's so fast as simple! I just LOVE it!ü§ó
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Google photos for years now, I like everything about it except when you sync the photos with cloud and delete from the device, the reference photos disappears from folders, and you have to scroll all the way down to find if you are looking for old photos/videos. I hope they fix it and uploaded photos also stays in the folder to find photos easier rather than scrolling hundred times."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's fine. You'll never lose a picture, but you'll also never find it again. You'll just know it's IN Google Photos ;) For a company that indexes everything so well, it's surprising that you can't search based on what folder or app the picture came from, like Instagram or Facebook. That would really help find pictures, wouldn't it? It would also be great to be able to quickly tag multiple photos with categories or keywords. Also, they removed the one click rotate of images, so now you have to edit the image, click rotate, rotate it, click done, then save. Before all you had to do was click the rotate button right there under the image. Progress."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great little app! Can be set-up to backup all photos on the device on which it is installed, and will provide 'memories' (old photos or collections) as a slide show on the anniversary on which they were taken. The app also features a Favourites category for easy access of photos which are used on a regular basis, as well as an archive which stores document-type photos. The app seamlessly syncs across devices and the user can backup the photo gallery of multiple devices simultaneously."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Updated:- So, I can't rename photos using this app. Do basic things like resize a photo to a specified height and width (in pixels or percentage). If I move anything to the camera folder and try to move it to some other folder (or just move a file already in camera folder), well, I can't do that. The downloads folder doesn't detect new downloads (like images downloaded from google). And when I have to share a photo in some app (like Discord, etc) through Photos, I don't even see all my photos."

The only drawback is the OMG I can't seem to get photos that are shared, that no one offers any photos in return, but one person. Sometimes there may be a loss of some photos I am going back and rereading those help tutorials I believe That I missed it the first time."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I cannot praise this app enough. Almost half of my daughter's first year pictures I thought were lost due to destroyed phone and the micro sd card containing the photos beinh encrypted to that phone. Not even thinking when I set Google up on my new phone some weeks later happened to open the photo app by accident and was blown away to have access to every photo via backup.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Very poor experience since changing phones. Had difficulty transferring WhatsApp images but thought I had it cracked - I was wrong. Edit facility of date works for some photos but not others. And then the edit facility for those which did work suddenly disappears. Even worse was when photos were then displayed under incorrect dates - metadata showed a different date to that listed. Had no such issues with Samsung Gallery. Have now downloaded Aves Gallery and I'm much happier!
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I don't care for the auto archive option. I'd like the option to change the pictures in the google-made movies. I do not like there being an older picture covering the new pictures I'm trying to look at. I'd like to stop pictures gping into an album after a certain time, instead of one album full of everyone I tag.

However, Google eliminated full quality uploads to the cloud for free, meaning I've lost the RAW files and only left with compressed ones. Why is such a destructive feature so carelesly implemented?"

For plain cloud storage it's fine, for simple photo edit it's fine, but album creation or edit is always a fickle thing. Sometimes works - sometimes not.

Just my experience and opinion , no big deal."

Also if there were a way to avoid backing up all those forwards on whatsapp.. not needed at all and ends up eating space. This too would be easier to manage if the albums stayed on Photos the way they are on phone

The issue is the folder is located on the sd card does not show up in backup and sync.....There needs to be an option to remove / exclude folders / location. I have my music, which also includes the album art, in one location / folder. I do not need to see / view the album art in google photos and no need to back them up. They just clutter up the app and adds unnecessary storage in the backup."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I just think it's cool as hell when the app, on it's own and without my input, will surprise me with a movie or collage it made using pics I recently took. And no, it's not a security risk when it does that. When the app presents it's newest creations to me it gives me the option to save or delete before anyone else has a chance to see it.

It's fine for storing pics that'll stay in place forever, but if you want to move certain ones to new albums? Forget it.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have never left my opinion on anything before. I am unhappy with the changes made to this app. I am not a fan of timeline setups. I think it is junkie. I do not want to have to search by date of when something happened. Losing the file folders system to move pictures to for work or personal makes me not want to take pictures. I have to have my phone for work and myself. This app does not let you separate that anymore.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I just simply love Google photos especially because it backs up and when you switch phones you don't lose your pictures. I guess it depends on the phone itself as to how well your pictures look but my pictures are great. I may be a little prejudiced though because I am a picture fanatic. As far as this app goes I simply love it. I just wish the gallery was as good as the Google photos as far as backing it up and all. It is my favorite app of all other apps!!
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Thank you for being a nuisance to the consumer in yet another way... Stop ""improving,"" things. You ALWAYS break them. Case in point, you just re-dated my photos after editing one of them. Some were off by a day, others several days to weeks. I'm not even sure how that's possible... Anyway, I deleted the edited photo and all photos from the past weekend as a hopeful fix. Thankfully, it worked. Just leave things alone. Google phone. Fully updated... Although, I'm going to be pickier from now on."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"What has happened to the Google Photos. I cannot edit pictures since the last update. How do I fix this issue. When I click edit in photos, the app crashes. Please help."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google photos is an absolute marvel. The syncing across devices, sharing with friends and family, and offline access make it so useful it just blows my mind. I regularly use it to share family photos to distant family members, as well as for work photos. The way it recognizes people and places and categorizes photos is also very useful. Lastly, the Google curated slideshows, collages, and movies are a wonderful treat. Bravo Google!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love this app it automatically backs up all my photos to free space up on my phone, and it also makes different animations and cool photo props. It also can reconize different people and makes folders for the different people. Its got so many different things too much to mention. I just absolutely love this app and thats all I can really say!!!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love the app. It's super convenient to have all my photos backed up in the same place especially when I switch between phones on my line alot. I always have my photos when I need them. I do have a issue though. I was cleaning out my storage and went through all my photos. I ended up choosing almost 8,000 photos and videos to delete. It took me hours to go through and select them. I clicked delete and the app wouldn't delete them. I redid it and the same thing happened I need my storage cleaned"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great for storing photos, but I wish there was a way to save my albums when I switch my photos from my phone to my backup. It puts them in timeline order, and majority of my photos are saved from web, so it makes it super difficult to find one. Also, facial recognition needs a LOT of work. The ""people and pets"" feature drives me insane, I wish I could have more control over what faces the app recognizes and help it recognize them more."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google Photos is great for smart organization and storage of all my pics and videos. I can search Photos by person, place, time, or even animals and objects. I can make simple edits quickly, but pro editing features are user friendly as well. Sharing with friends and family within the app is super convenient, and sharing to other apps is easy too. I love the Photos Assistant, and Photos integrations with G Suite, Maps, and Google My Business have been great for my productivity!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is great, interface is simple. The face recognition feature is so immensely powerful and also the edit corner. I have changed 4 devices since using Google photos and I have them all. The big problem is that over time you have a lot not-so-good pictures, using AI it must find all of them, and it seriously needs a space manager just like Google Files to delete duplicate photos, blurry photos etc. Resolve it as soon as possible."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Awful since the Android system update! I never had problems before, but now it is terrible. I cannot delete photos or videos from my phone easily...it takes about 3 tries to delete, I have to close the app & reopen it, and even then it's only successful about 50% of the time, so it's more hassle than it is worth to even try since it takes 5 minutes to delete 1 photo. (I have Moto G7 Power)"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Not user friendly. I have to go to all different random albums that google makes up when looking at my photos. Why can't there be a place with all photos and screenshots and videos, etc?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My photos that are from text messages will not show up in the main picture area despite me toggling for this
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Your APP is really helpful. It makes it easy going for me to access my photos and accomplish my tasks. But sometimes I do delete some pictures that I do not like or want. And sometimes I do delete pictures by mistake. And sometimes when I do not have the intention of deleting any picture, the app will ask me if I want to ""move the picture to the trash."" If I want to, I will say yes. And if I do not want to delete any thing, I often found out I deleted a picture or an image by mistake. But when I want to retrieve the pictures back, I will not be able to find the trash can or the location of the trash can. It will be nice if I can easily locate the trash can to be able to retrieve my lost pictures or even to finally delete the unwanted images, in order to have more space to store new pictures. I just love your app and your services. Thanks again."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Not sure what to do with this app. Pictures seem to disappear, can find no way to retrieve them. I also have to agree with Carrie Tohl finding my pictures has become such a chore. I delete duplicates & in a couple of days, they have magically , are back. Also im not seeing any new filters. Instead they pull one of the pictures throw a really Nice filter ,drag you in & never get direction on finding the right App!! SO YOUR SUGGESTION WOULD BE??!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Working good Need name of people in recognized faces sort options like name, gender, age level etc"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"If only if there where more options. There is no undo option for backing up/freeing up. It's frustrating to see all your photos gone in the Gallery too, even though it's on Google Photos, implying that we should use Google Photos primarily. Plus, it backs up photos on accounts I don't want it to back up on. When disable it, it disables backing up for every single connected account. Give me a break!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Had this app for donkeys years. Loved it till the new update. Before the update it would show you what happened 1,2,3,4 etc years ago and I loved looking at photos I took all those years ago, especially on the kids birthdays when I could see how they've grown over the years but they got rid of this amazing feature and now it's 'remember this' or 'days at the beach' with the most random of photos from over the years. I miss looking at photos from the same day/ week. Please change it back Google."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Animations are great. I love seeing what it has put together for me. Collages are usually not the best collection of pictures but I understand it's generally random pictures of the same time/subject. Stylized photos are usually nice. I think it would be even better if I used it more than looking at the suggestions.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Yes I stored some of my photos and video in a lock folder and I can't locate it now I'm looking for over an hour looking for it you know it's something that I really need it's important but I have to do this for I don't know how much longer before I can figure it out it's I mean I should be able to punch in lock folder and should come up and put my password and get in but no it doesn't work like that you have to sit here and waste hours of time to figure out how the hell to get your stuff back.i
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The facial recognition is spot on. The automated gifs, collages, short films with sound are perfect. But the absolute best feature of the Google Photos app is being able to organize all the different faces into its own app. Facial recognition is Genius!!! I'm Google pro all the way now. I'm hooked to your maps and contributing new locations with photos. We are the pioneers of the digital world when a new spot is added to the map that's one down 478 billion more."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I would give zero if I could. Almost all of my pics have disappeared, I can see them on the main page of the Photos app. But they aren't in any folder and I can't access them via the camera roll of apps like Snap, WhatsApp, or even texting. Google just gave me the run around, zero help. This app is garbage, just deletes or moves files without consent. I'm done with Google devices!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I tried to moved my photos which happened just fine. But when I deleted the photos I didn't want want, it also deleted them from my phone. And through a process that took me 5+ hours!!!!!! I was able to download them onto my computer then to my local memory, to a USB and back onto my phone...I had to get more memory to even get them out of the trash. Some kind of service when you can't even get your photos back... I will never use Google Photos for this reason ever again"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Poor customer service. This app is a product and yet it deletes photos off of your phone and synced devices without your permission. If you delete a photo off google photos, it deletes it from all devices. There is no button to turn it off. Once your device is synced and it hooks up to the internet thats it. How an app gets away with deleting things of my devices, with no turn off is beyond me. Stay away from this and find something else."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a free website/app that allows you to upload unlimited photos or videoes downscaled or 15 GB of full size photos. Connects your albums easily to Google Chrome Tv. Allows you to share easily to others. Catagories your photos by date, place, or people. Search function. Free enhancement tools. Auto creates some videoes, collages or artwork based on some of your uploads. Downside is that this app crashes once in a while but that hasn't been too bad for me."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The best part about this app is going to be changed! Which is unlimited high resolution photo storage. This is really sad and disappointing. I really liked this app because i don't have to worry about losing my photos that much. Recently my SD card died on me and i lost all my photos. Google photos did rescued me. But now I'm worried what I'm going to do with all my photos and memories. I don't have the access to restore them locally now. :(
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app and love that all my photos are backup. I also enjoy being able to edit photos and view animations, etc. I just can't seem to figure out if there's a way to delete images from the app without my photos being deleted from my device as well - it's quite annoying."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I hate that you can't organize a gallery like you used to (ie: move a photo from camera folder to a folder you made without it still being in the camera folder), I hate how I basically have two sets of folders (device and drive) instead of being able to have the option to just backup the device folders. I hate that I needed to download a third party gallery app for it. GP Said my photos were backed up, then had to do a factory reset to find it wasn't. Photos of my dog that died are gone."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app keeps deleting photos from my Messenger Lite folder. I don't have cloud backup because I just want the photos to stay on the damn phone. I even have screenshots of the gallery, photos available one day, gone the next. Luckily it's only one folder that's affected or my screenshot would disappear too. Edit: today I tried saving photos from Messenger Lite. Just opened the folder to see if they still existed and -watched- one photo disappear. It's not in the trash."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Love Google Photos! I've always used it on every phone. It backs it up and let's you do all sorts of things. Only issue is I wish there was a spot to choose to save all my photos to sd card and create different folders. I maybe overlooking it too. If so I'd like to find out where to go. I will give 5 Stars if there is a way for both issues.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"New edit. Down a star. So basically, the ""Memories"" feature has been completely ruined. What used to be a fun little thing to remember fun moments turned into a complete annoyance. The nice audio from my videos has now been covered up by awful music, with no way to turn it off without muting my video too. It starts to create things like ""posters"" ""selfies"" ""signs"" ""documents"". And they are just flat out wrong. There is no way to turn them off or adjust them whatsoever, and it's really annoying."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's fine, but what I don't like it that it dosen't recognize the folders it's pulling from. I have some carefully curated folders, and this just lumps them all together. Search function is not useful in this case. I end up backing my photos to a hard drive just to keep the folders intact. Also would be nice if it had a feature to detect duplicates."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ive tried multiple times to restore photos so I could have the photos and videos in my device but after a few days its deleted from my device. Now I see more than half of my photos and videos deleted that were saved on this app. I am extremely upset. Idk if its just happening to me or if its a bug within the app itself. I feel like I've lost so many memories that I can never get back.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love what you guys are doing. Thank you,! This is great this app is awesome ! Update : There is a problem I'm having now finding all my photos.. And Why do you only brighten some pictures and not others? When I want to change my profile pictures out I am directed to the Amazon Gallery, and can only use photos from the albums there..! If I leave there, I can't connect Google photos with Facebook profile. I'd rather have all of my photos in one spot instead of scattered.. üôÜ"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,If you take a lot of photos this app is for you. plus it also has a lot of benefits to/for people that forget or doesn't know how to backup or restore their phone so they don't lose none of their photos. Very helpful and also easy to use. A must have if you've got a love for photography and or just taking pictures in general? Benifits both professional and amateur photo takers or if your just an everyday ordinary person(LOL like I am) that loves to save your memories through pictures?Has it all!
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Previously very happy with this app but since my last update it's pretty useless. It takes photos but that's it. Won't let you edit at all. Even simple stuff like trying to crop a photo. Once you hit save it crashes the app. When you reopen the photo is either unedited or a new copy of the original (no edits done) is there. Dates have also been jumbled up.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I haven't updated my photos yet, and by looking at the majority of customer reviews most of which have one a two stars. Why would I? Yet when I woke up this morning I noticed that you took it upon yourself to medal with my photos. So now your baisicly telling me that I have to upgrade""Or Else"". I loved the format you had, and I'm not the most technical person, that's why I have a outdated phone as well. It might be outdated but I know my phone like the back of my hand. If It ain't broke.."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Was using the default version of the app that came with the Pixel 7 Pro and in the edit window under suggestions it had options such as dynamic, color pop, vivid, luminous, radiant etc. Suddenly it changed and only has enhance, warm and cool. Why have these options disappeared? How do you get them back? Great app if I can get these features back otherwise it's very basic and buggy."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"No really. Why would you go from a better model to an older ancient one? Like, i could choose not to upload videos on my phone automatically, just the photos. But after the update, i see that half my data is gone because Google photos decided to upload my 1GB vid to the cloud. And no, don't you dare tell me about wifi and background data monitoring because it's either upload everything or turn backup & sync off. Really the new update sucks. big time. thank you very much."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely amazing! I love Google lens! Also, the editing features are wonderful. Photos that are taken in dark light and sent to me through messages or whatever look so much better on my phone after editing... My Apple friends send me stuff, get me to edit it and send it back... It would be funny if it weren't so pathetic. üòã"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I think some things can be changed such as being able to view your photos in archive easier without restoring. However I forget pinch to zoom exists, try to use it more. Extra options for locked folders would be a huge benefit as well. I've experienced issues with the locked storage folder in the files app which has caused bugs when used with the photos locked album. I have also noticed time and date changing if photos are deleted, and then restored from trash. It updates with false information."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Google photos was great until the last upgrade. Actually, I consider the upgrade a downgrade. Took me two weeks to find shared photos and only accidentally bumped an icon to find it. Had a hell of a time finding the trash so I could empty it. It is no longer user-friendly. My entire family uses the app and all of us are completely frustrated. I wish you'd go back to the previous version so that I could give you more stars. You took a nice app and really effed it up."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The fact that you made it so music plays and photos zoom in/out while viewing memories was just a horrible idea. Not to mention the fact that when you long press, it doesn't clear the photo of clutter anymore, it just pauses auto-play. The reason so many companies try to fix what isn't broken is just way beyond me. Edit: That's a great dismissive reply. Like my single opinion will change your business... Edit: Viewing memories now only shows the left half the photos... Going with another app üëé"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It would be much more convenient to have both options for albums and folders we have on our device, and consider either a folder or an album. The difference is really confusing in the app, and it makes the management awful. Overhal, not really easy to use app in the way that things are managed really strangely, not only for albums and folders"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Racketeering Scam. I must have accidentally loaded the Google photos app. Now it has backed up all my photos and videos and filled the 15gb limit. I cannot receive emails anymore. There is no way to free storage on my Google account without deleting the pictures from my device. The only option I have is to pay to upgrade my storage. I do not want to do this as I already pay a competitor for this service.(which do allow you to delete from the cloud only). What a scam! I hate you Google.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Had to uninstall. Often when I tried to use it it would give me some message about some new feature or option in the way of using the app. I see a lot of reviews talking about the absolutely unacceptable behavior of this app automatically backing up, archiving, altering folders and such & Google having the audacity to tell us that they ""need more"" information instead of fixing it so it doesn't do that Google is acting like it is isolated to that guy, ignoring the other many of the same claims"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My pic is always great The official Google Photos app is made for the way you take photos today and includes essential features like shared albums, automatic creations and an advanced editing suite. You won‚Äôt have to worry about storage either as you can choose to automatically back up all your photos and videos for free in high quality. You can then access them from any connected device."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Popped up on my device complaining that it would be full and instead of allowing me to close and move photos later when I was at a computer, it deleted 20 GB of photos off of my phone. No preservation of hours spent moving photos to albums and will take a LONG time to get them moved back to my device and resorted again, assuming they're even all actually saved Very pissed off. I never opened this app in the first place and will never use it so long as a different gallery option exists."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love it for work photos (emergency service restoration = 1000s photos per job) super easy to use. Photos typically stay in the order their take. Great back up to any fancy job management software that always fails at the worst time. Only complaint is how long it can take the named albums to finish loading before you can send them off. Even with WiFi Maybe 2 mins maybe 55 mins.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love the new update, I especially love the feature where larger folders don't load, or how it's face recognition software thinks Keanu Reeves and Kurt Russell are the same person. The new update really didn't do much good. The preinstalled app is still useful for managing and organising photos, as well as mass sharing them, but like I said before, larger libraries now no longer load."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"There's no way to delete photos directly from Albums, or move suggested Manage Library/Archive photos to a different folder, instead you need to go back to camera roll and scan through all photos you've ever taken to delete/move the few you want. This makes it not user friendly for folks who take a lot of pics for different projects and then need to easily find and edit those albums."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love this app for various reasons: 1.Cloud storage, 2.Instantly Backs up all photos/videos, 3.Automatically groups certain photos together. Simply put this app is fantastic for people that take tons of pictures. My only suggestion would be to add more ""editing"" options within the app. It would be wonderful to be able do all the extras like in other available photo editing apps but all in one instead of having various apps for the same reason."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"While some features are really cutting edge, like the creepy facial recognition, etc- other things are lacking. Such as private folders you can secure with a password. Folders in general are a mess. I add things to a folder and it's still in my camera roll, which isn't really helpful for keeping things organized. Except sometimes it creates a different location and moves them, but there's no way to tell it which to do. So there's two sets of folders? Organizing my media is top priority in an app, Im honestly surprised this is so lacking."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Where's the photo stack option? I followed the guidelines, backup turned on and complete but still no photo stack option available... As I said that option is simply not there. Please review last android version. photo stack option is missing."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I'm extremely dissatisfied after turning on backup. It deleted photos of my device without my permission. They seem to still be in the cloud but no way for me to get them back into the folders I had put them in originally if I can even find them all. The app won't even show photos that I've manually moved to a folder. Thanks Google for completely screwing up my photos.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"1/21/23: Thanks developer for answer, however what works on albums doesn't work for folders. 1/16/23: App no longer files photos by date order in a folder. Sometimes the last photo put in a folder is the 1st shown, sometimes if a photo is edited it will be next to the original sometimes it is 1st. 5/18/20: App doesn't rename photos, must use ""files"" app. If you move a pic to another folder, it's date & file name changes so a pic from any date when moved becomes today's date."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Pay the money to store your photos. It fixes rotation, it identifies faces, it is AWESOME. I can search for one of my kids and it pulls up every picture they're in going back years! It develops photo compilations, stitches them into panorama shots, and makes slideshows of trips. It pops up photos from the same date 2, 3, 4 years ago. It even recommends junk photos to trash. It's a great way to organize a photo library."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely loving this app!!! It self creates wonderful collages and video clips, that are surprising and enjoyable! Sharing between google account holders, could not be easier!! NO MORE LONG FAMILY EMAILS OF PHOTOS. Archiving features to minimise data storage is fantastic! For 2019 if you dont have a gmail account, get one - its free and easy. Set up the rest of the family with one and make sharing photos a breeze. As your phone backs up the images, all linked acounts recieve automatically."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Experience has been maddening with the latest update. It notifies you of things like collages and lookbacks far too frequently, the interface now makes it harder to find different things, and if you click on any suggested stylized images it immediately starts a wandering slideshow journey through your own photos instead of letting you look at the one you want."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I went to upload a few photos to a shared folder for a trip with some friends. Next thing I know Google photos has synced my entire gallery from my phone to my Google account, which has run up all the space and I have no idea how it happened. Now I can't recieve emails, can't upload to Drive, half my photos are gone from my phone and unorganized. I want to revert this, and bring them all back to my device and off my Google account, but have not been able to find a guide. This makes no sense üëé"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"There's things I love about this app but the most important functions have flaws. For example the quality of my pictures and videos are affected once they are uploaded to Google photos. I have great camera quality and it just doesn't compare once they are on Google photos. Also, I would appreciate if the default setting was NOT 'storage saver' because there is no way to revert it back. Many of my older photos were under this setting because I wasn't aware of it and now I can't change the quality"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a real great app, simply the best.. but there should be an option to add faces when the app can't recognise them in the photos, this is a major issue I've faced, and that when I search for,say screen records, or downloads, or WhatsApp photos, videos, at times it so happens that it's there, uploaded, but it doesn't show in the search results."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good experience so far. Would like to see all of the features in the phone app version available online. Or, Google photos could become a downloadable program/app for PCs, this would be incredible. Some things missing from the online version: sharpening, portrait, blur tools etc. Ability to permanently edit/attach locations so stored in photo files as well as date created date changes to properly order photos, especially scans of older photos. Google photos could become a very powerful tool"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I don't think I have many issues with Google photos BUT for the past few months I literally haven't been getting any memories from previous days/weeks/months/years, they just don't appear for me at the top of my backed up photos and videos. Plus some stuff doesn't even get backed up which is a bummer. If those could be fixed, that would be really great."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's great to keep my photos all in one place, but it's not intuitive. There's no option to download back to my phone, despite troubleshooting. Which is beyond irritating. Also, when you move a photo to a folder, it should delete it from the general section. That way it's safe to scroll regardless who you're showing them to."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I miss the opportunity so see all the media which Google assistant created but which aren't saved yet. Now when I get a notification that a new stylised picture or movie created, I click on that notification and the app opens a stories with the Recent Highlights. I have to check all Highlights if I want to save everything the assistant has created. I found it very inconvenient. I'd like to have something similar to library->utilities to have auto-generated media all in one place"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I only wish it had an option to label or tag photos to find my photos faster. I have lots of photos and it's hard to find the pictures I'm looking for. The automatic organization is good but not very effective. I even tried a link that was given to me as a reply in a review I did with another account but the link didn't work. Other than that, everything else about this app is great."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Pretty awful. Interface mostly clumsy. I copied photos from one folder to the other, it changed the date of the pictures to the date when I copied them. Now it's a mangled mess. Can't have a view where all my pictures (including screenshots etc) are in one timeline. Sent 7MB of data. I have no idea what. tl;dr classic Google App, will probably get discontinued soon anyway so just get simple gallery"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Simply the best. I don't 500 characters are enough to say about this app so I'll make it short. Not only easy great for organizing my photos and easy to share, it fixes my photos, automatically creates panorama pictures from individual pictures I took, automatically creates collage from related photos. The feature I like the most is it often shows me old pictures so I can relive the moment."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Used to be really good for archiving all photos on my phone and laptop and being able to access files from my laptop on my phone. Lately the mobile app has completely stopped working though. I can't delete photos or videos, add anything to albums, or access anything uploaded from my laptop whatsoever. I can no longer edit or crop photos either. Photos is my phone's default gallery app so I don't have a lot of other options available to me, and It's making accessing my files extremely difficult."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love it so far, simple and easy to navigate. And auto collage is really cool, using AI to sort different things and people, i can search photos by word. Also features called ""Memories"" bring back nostalgic old photos beautifully. The free 15 gb is suffice but i hope there's more free storage or the storage is different from Google account storage. It would be perfect haha.."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love google photos and the fact that it has unlimited storage. Prior to using it, I lost a lot of photos and videos that I didn't back up so great that it doea it for me. Love that it gives me notifications with memories. Wish there were more movie options and editing options in general but overall, I love it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely furious. This ridiculous app backs up all your photos, eating up all your google drive storage. Then when you go to delete the ""back ups"" from the app, it says it will also delete the photos from your device. Why the f*** can you not delete the back up without deleting the original? I moved my photos to a folder that was not synced with the app, hoping to delete just the photos off of this app, but it still deleted all my photos from the device as well. 2 years of my children lost"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,New Android One and Photos has made the previously simple process of taking and sharing a screenshot ridiculously difficult. As if trying to hold the power and volume buttons at the same time wasn't daft enough photos won't go straight to sharing it. Software needs to be easy to use. Too many notifications to look at old photos when I'm getting ready in the morning
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I want to love Google Photos. The concept and capabilites are best in class. However, it fails from an operational perspective. Uploading my photo library took weeks because the application had multiple crashes and restarts. The facial recognition and grouping work for photos taken on my cell phone but not for uploaded photos. Been a month with no processing progress. In addition, the auto rotate detection stopped. Need fixes for these core functionalities to improve experience and my rating."

Google Photos sends you little stylized versions of your photos every day along with videos with musical background and collages and I absolutely love & save 98% of them! From one photo snob to another, please install this app! :)"

Alzso having issues with adding to album . Still jumping open and close when I try to use my keyboard. 2nd) Google photos annoying. The suggestions are to intrusive. Being able to pick the options are here when you are ready for your choice of action. Its like a OVERLY helpful two years old or a pet constantly asking the same question while blocking while working
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Worst app I've ever used for a gallery. Ever. Doesn't let me sort my photos except in albums only on google photos, can't easily save to device or manage device folders for images. And always opens right into my camera roll, thanks why don't you show off my sensitive photos to just EVERYONE. And I can't even use my photos off it, it keeps trying to download and failing so I can't even use some of my stuff."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"By far the best gallery application ever. Granted I use it because it's always been on Nexus/Pixel by default, but the layout and features it has are simply outstanding. Especially the way it automatically creates albums per location or contents of your images is the best. The location albums make it way easier to find a certain picture I am looking for since I know where I took them, and the object based albums are very interesting themselves. Keep up the good work big G."

I have an S20FE, and based on what I read, I'd never dl Google Photos. Samsung Gallery is way better. Plus, I use Dropbox as my backup. You get something like 20gb for free, and then you have to pay for storage. I don't mind; it's peace of mind when it comes to my memories. I know they're safe. And I just work from my gallery. If you delete from the gallery, it doesn't delete from Dropbox."

This thing deleted most of my photos from MY PHONE MEMORY! WHAT? now I can't find it anywhere how to undo it...I had my photos organized in folders and a lot of them were motion photos and in good quality... And some of them weren't even synced! I am very upset and would like someone from support help me to restore my pictures"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A life saver app. Helps store all the amazing memories on the cloud. Have been using it since a few years now. However, im rating it a 4 star because the back-up keeps stopping as soon as you leave the app. This never used to happen earlier. Now as soon as you leave the app the back-up stops. Developers Please Note: The feature to start backup as soon as phone is plugged in to the charger needs to definitely come back!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible. I can't use my camera now or access any of my photos on my phone. I did not accept to have them moved off my phone. I have heaps of space on my phone for more photos but because google photos is full, it has essentially blocked me from using other functions on my phone constantly telling me to free up space. Since the photos were moved over to google photos, it has left them on my photo app as black. I cannot clear the black photos as it says they are not there. It's awful!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"All of a sudden, the app has stopped uploading pictures to cloud. It began with seven pictures pending, then 10, then 12. I uninstalled updates, tried backing up, it worked for some time and then stopped again. Edit: Absolutely ruined a perfectly good app. Even the photos that have been successfully uploaded don't show up (that too in a 100 MBPS WiFi zone). Shame, Google."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"So far not too bad. Only thing I don't like is that photos that go to cloud get compressed and all those albums disappear once they go to cloud. In the 'photos' tab, I'm forced to scrolllllllll long way to find one photo. I don't get to just jump back into my album the way it was prior to cloud transfer. Change the photo compression please. Make it the SAME as when the photo is taken on the phone. Keep albums as they are, just make the cloud storage a: 'copy to cloud'"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"At first this is the best one, but later it turn disaster for now. When opening the app, I often being reminded to do backup and re-organize photos. Then if I refuse, the app hid the current photos/videos, had to wait for 10 minutes or when I had good internet connection. I also accidentally press the login with google account, and now I cannot logged out and use the offline version! Please make it optional again to keep the offline version while still using data."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Just recently the app started having issues with cropping and rotating images. I'll click save after doing one of these two and it will just load and load for literally 15 minutes. And there's an issue with saving any videos longer than like a minute. They don't show up immediately but then suddenly appear after a half hour or so. It used to only do it with videos that were like 10+ minutes. I started noticing this all when the two new options on the far right were added when editing a picture.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The latest update was terrible. I went to Locked Folder just to see nothing in it. Literally nothing. I always turned on the back up data and always taking care of my photos carefully. But after I updated the apps, I opened the Locked Folder and it's resetting from the start to set a password for it, how? Also, I always get message like; ""Please Re-install Photos."" like that, frequently. I have so, so, so many important photos that I keep at Locked Folder. Please, fix this. Thank you."

Initial it showed the number of pictures inside the shared album increased after my upload into the album but then it returned to the initial number of pictures again and again. Finally, I realized the album owner doesn't enable the 'Collaborate' option; it works after the album owner enable the option. The app failed to inform users that there was a permission issue."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this app!! It takes photos, sometimes edits them itself, but you get the option to keep, same with videos with your photos and uses music in conjuntion with them and they are so cute! I love having my photos organized and in a cloud storage. This app is perfect for all of that. Not to mention you can edit your own pictures, make collages (it does that for you too ;) ), and make videos! Just loving this!!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It has pictures in utilities suggesting to archive and they aren't in any of my folders. I had previously deleted them. Also, took me a while to figure out that if I delete in Google Photos it will also delete on my device automatically. At least it doesn't delete from Google Photos if I delete from my device. Also, my pictures were all still automatically backing up even though I had the backup and sync turned off. Some things are confusing. Taking a while to figure out."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's useful overall but annoying how it automatically makes animations: 1) it uses up precious data. 2) it's more to manage. Make it initially an OPTION. I'd like a feature that suggests automatic grouping of similar types of images like portraits, faces, group shots, landscape, vacation etc. Won't be useful for all customers if putting family, friends and potential dates in three separate categories-- but still useful."

I hate getting a new phone & trying to find pictures you aren't sure if you took them with the old phone or the new one. Not to mention they always use up all your memory & cause your phone to slow way down. I mean 15 GB is a whole lot of pics and videos, who can complain about paying $1.99 to upgrade your storage to 100 GB! The ability to search through your photos by face, place, or item is awesome & makes it easy to find older memories quickly"

Thanks Edit: On June 2021, there will be no more free unlimited storage for high quality photos. That sucks ngl, because for those people who take a photos and videos a lot, the storage will be very limited and it's only 15gb. Sad. Might as well try to find new apps for back up."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is great to have reminders of new albums created, photos that have been enhanced and memories from previous years that are put out for review and my saving in new albums. I like the ability to communicate with Google Home Hub and have it scroll photos of my memories. The backup capability gives me solace in the fact my memories are safe. The ability to share and partner is a great feature. I always look forward to see what will be offered next."

All my photos were already backed up, now it's uploading them all over again except this time half are missing. I've lost all the many albums I've made including images and videos I've spent huge amounts of time creating and editing over the years... gone! I've lost the ability to save screenshots and Instagram stories to my phone. I save stories before posting them so I can edit and store them before posting and now I can't do that at all"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,One of the recent updates ruined uploading files to the app from a phone. It takes FOREVER to upload pictures and videos to this app now. It's been over a week and the same 8 pictures & videos have not finished uploading. What the hell?!? It's easier to just install the files to a desktop/laptop and then upload from there. This is ridiculous.

IT'S LACKING MANY BASIC FEATURES! More tools for better user control is a must! SURPRISINGLY SUBPAR!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Used to be brilliant but looking into alternatives as I have a lot of photos that have deteriorated in the app. My storage is filling up so I may soon have to pay for a service that is losing my photos. Update in reply to Google photos. The storage is not a problem. I am happy to pay. The problem is my photos that I uploaded in original quality are degraded to such a bad state that I can no longer see them. Bands of gray appearing on the photos. Very upsetting. I don't trust google with my pics
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is really good, keeping our memories safe and available at one Click. The only problem with this aap is when we delete photo from this app it also deletes the same from the device which is something to be fixed on Priority as we do not want to store all the images on cloud. Hope your team brings this feature in app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"it's good. good concept, but not user friendly. Some edits were overlooked in the way of sharing and sharing is out of sequence. And deleting.. that's a cluster. you work on multiple devices. Delete from one, thinking it was deleted from all only to log in later on the deleted device, you find out that the photos were put back because their also on another device. With some tweaking, it'll be number one. But until then, I give it a 2 stars. Feel free to contact me. You have my info."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was blessed to get a Google Pixel 3a and with it Google Photos. It's so nice not to have to worry about moving my photos to a SD card. You can make folders, which I share from events. I've even uploaded photos from my computer to one of the folders. I'd like to be able pick photos for collages, but I still have another app to fall back on. I had already made some gifs with it before I got the phone. Would suggest it for anyone."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app has a significant issue that keeps me from rating it higher. When moving a photo to another folder, which I do often to keep things organized, the photo's date changes to the current date. This causes photos to not be organized properly in the folder I've just moved them to. A quick Google search reveals that this is an ongoing issue encountered by many users. Something as simple as correctly keeping a photo's date shouldn't be that difficult."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Of all the gallery apps I've tested I'd give Google Photos five out of five stars for ease of use, and top quality features like the ability to search your albums by person, by things like lakes or winter, by date or time period, also it fully integrates to your pc or Mac or even iPhone and gives you the ability to immediately free up space on your mobile device with a tap by optionally deleting only photos and videos that have already been backed up. Even video stabilization with a tap!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love it for so many reasons. My only critique is having to use device folders for albums, because other wise, you don't have access to photos on the cloud for uploading etc unless you just want one continues device folder called ""Camera"". I just want all of my photos to be in albums that are stored as albums - google photos doesn't store your divide folders as albums, you instead have to recreate a new album in the library (or cloud) part of google photos. Very inconvenient and not streamlined."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Update 2: It would be really nice if it wasn't ""Waiting for wifi"" and not uploading while I am on wifi. Very frustratin Update 1: No crashing since I got a pixel. Now the only thing is the partner sharing with my spouse, and their view is worse than the standard experience. Otherwise quite a good app. Original 1 star review: Its a really good app, except that half the time when I open it, it immediately crashes. It seems to be when its backing up on WiFi, but regardless it is really annoying."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There is an option to free space that deleted all my photos from my gallery (I prefer to have them on-prem and I had them sorted in albums, which were not synchronised in Google Photos). It's confusing and doesn't really warn you that it will permanently delete everything, nor does it ask for permission. On top of that, I can't download all my photos at once and have to select them one by one which is extremely time consuming. I wish there was a way to revert the deletion."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Not only does this auto save every time I connect to wifi at a free or significantly lower rate than iCloud. It also auto creates movies, albums, animations, memories and auto edits. Additionally, the facial recognition is amazing for searching photos!

Could not be more satisfied with the way I can organize and share memories for a lifetime!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love being able to use 'Search' tool engine and finally find a photo I've been looking for. It helps tremendously, and it's one of those convenient but considerably ""life-saving"" tools that save time instead of having to literally scroll back through thousands of photos after forgetting date/time and/or location a photo was taken.. and what makes using Google Photos even better..? You'll find all of your storage automatically backed-up in a safe place. Haven't had any privacy concerns so far"

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This was a fun app. Emphasis on the ""was"". For photos I can understand utilizing it. It came with my phone, ergo I used it. But for editing videos, which was mostly what I did, things already went wrong when the picture suddenly began to crop itself all weird, like it tried to correct being filmed vertically (which I never film that way), and as a result the edits come out the size of a cheez-it. Even after updating it, which I hoped would fix things, everything was just harder to find."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like this app,, just wish that there will be an option of what picture or video to back up, and also an option of when and when not to back up,, like you have the option to choose what you want to backup and not it backing up automatically,, especially considering the amount of data that will be wasted in backing up some unnecessary pictures and long videos"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,it's a good app and all l I like being able to save all my favorite photos and videos some where. But there is a issue where ill save a a lot of photos and instead of going to the top like few of the photos they get spread around the app. what I mean is the dates of most photos are at different dates and pictures duplicated themselves and there will more of the same pictures. I'm not sure what it is but hoping that u can fix it
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Excellent app. Does what it says. Just one problem. It takes a lot of time to buffer videos that are uploaded on google photos.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Why does the photos still stay in the gallery when I move to a folder? If I delete from gallery after I move to a folder in the library, both pictures are deleted. This is frustrating. It never use to be like that and you would think by moving to a folder , picture would still be there in a saved folder and storage space in gallery would be increased. If I'm missing something, please enlighten me."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A best option to store your memories in your google account, so that they never get lost and you can get them easily in any smartphone just by signing in your account, Also it keeps your photos and videos safely and quality of pictures depends on what setting you did.

The synching never works automatically and there I am on a trip with nice photos to share, but, by the time I finally get them my drive, no one cares anymore. I hate it. Worst thing Google ever did and the only reason I can figure they did it is to be able to charge us to store them. Instructions don't work, either. If I could give a zero rating, I would."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Just a fantastic app! Everything you could need or want, plus more. On top of managing your media storage, it has a Facebook inspired ""memories"" feature, tons of movie special and sound effects, and an excellent storage manager to keep your device free of clutter. All this, and a sizeable amount of free space to keep all this in the cloud! I will never not have this app again."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Photos used to be good. I gave this app TIME to get it together but it looks like I'll be breaking from it since it's no longer that same app. Although photos still does it's job of backing up your stuff. It has gotten infected by a nasty bug. It takes videos you upload and doesn't let you get them back. This crazed app will eventually taunt you to upgrade to keep your account working and if you don't you'll have to get rid of something(s) that you don't want to let go of. Slick tactic Google.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great for syncing your cellphone pictures with your Google Photos account and using high quality setting with free unlimited storage. Set it and forget it, and it's nice I can share large batches. However, sucks you won't be able to sort by individual or folder name. Many folks posted on the Google Photo help forum requesting and asking for this simple feature for a while, maybe it will get addressed here with a low rating. I'd be glad to bump the stars ratung to 5 if it gets added. Thank you."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've come to the conclusion that, you, Google, are terrible at making updates for your apps. First YouTube, then Chrome, now photos. I shouldn't have to change the location in which I save my photos in Chrome, just so they can appear in photos. if I want them saved on my SD card, save it in my SD card and make it show in photos. It worked like that in the previous update, why not now? I have to change it back to internal storage to make it show in Google Photos. Complete imbeciles at Google HQ!"

Now I can only ""save as a copy."" So I have duplicates. But even worse, the newer, edited photo (i.e. the one I want) is saved to the time I edited it. So it's no longer grouped with those photos when I scroll through pictures."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Over all not to bad. There a few things that would be a little bit easier to use. Wish the editor had a better selection and was easier to use and to figure out what the edits would do without having to use them. And some of the ones I couldn't even see the difference between the effects and original. Another thing I feel that needs work is the search by dates. I believe it's broken. For ex. I would put in one particular date that had a bunch of photos and it couldn't or wouldn't find them.‚úåÔ∏èOOR

This wasn't a problem before, as I move whatever to a folder that doesn't backup and it stays in the folder after I removed it from the cloud. Only now that's not how it works, it wants to delete it from my device and the cloud. Fix it Google and stop holding our photos and videos hostage."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Honestly this app is really helpful for freeing up space on your phone. You can have all you photos uploaded to one place and then room on your device for more. The only thing that's kind of tough is that the app doesn't save exactly how you organized your photos on your device... so you have to reorganize everything in the app.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's wonderful except that recently, when editing a photo, you can only save copy which then makes the picture come on top of all other pictures in that folder. Previously, you could save copy and delete original at the same time making the edited image to be just beside the original rather than going to be the first or top on the folder listing."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Not happy that Google automatically uploads photos to their cloud. I have to pull up the app and force a stop which only lasts for a short while.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The automatic feature of editing photos is nice, but is there a way to do that yourself? Such as customize the layout of a collage, and pick which pictures get the stylist feature. there is just one picture that was created automatically with a black and white background and the colored foreground. I want to choose which pictures have that happen."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Love it. It doesn't compress my photos or videos like other photo storage platforms. I only wish they had a 500GB storage option instead of 200GB or 1TB.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"People should use it to store and backup there photos and videos. The most useful feature is the 'Free up space' which allows you to delete unwanted photos once they are backed up. Also there is a safety feature which stops you to delete photos or videos which are not backed up yet. It still lacks some other features though, hope google will add them soon enough. Edit: Only if the AI worked better or if google upgrades it, so that we can search up any photo or by it's name."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Sooo buggy. I could love using this app to organize my photos, but I think it would be really helpful to have a 'search for album' function when adding new images to an existing album. It can be very difficult to find the album that the selected photo belongs in, esp because there is no sort by ABC order, date or search! I think this is an extreme oversight on an otherwise great app. Maybe the app developers could consider adding a feature to sort albums by abc, date and a SEARCH(cmon GoogleüôÑ)"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I like and hate the app. I like that it auto downloads all my stuff and gives me suggestions and stuff. I hate that it seems impossible to organize my photos and that I cant detect duplicates on it. I've been trying to organize my photos but I have over 10000 and if I cant move photos between albums or I wont know if I accidentally forgot to select a photo. I LOVE Google! but I hope they make some helpful upgrades to this app.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Every since I discovered this app this is the only one that I trust use and approve of for my photos... it also will send me collages, it makes a short movies for me with music, it brings back memories I've forgotten about, it is so easy.... They are improving every month is something new more improved and they give you plenty of storage for all your beautiful and Lasting memories... LOVE IT!!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't think I can put words to how much I hate this update. It is terrible. Simpler? Perhaps. Good? Not at all. The ""For You"" section was perfect before. I could go to a different area to find past years and the animations etc. I loved that. Now it's in the recent events? Hardly. Not able to scroll through those like before. It's absolute trash. Come on Google....."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This was my absolute favorite app... I would take pictures and save screenshots and took notes. Then every month I would open my Google Drive and sort the pictures on my PC into folders for easy retrieval... But, they took that connection away, now I go through too many steps to sort my pictures anymore... So I stopped using my phone for that. I never realized how useful that was until it was taken away. Was a 5 star program for organizing my life, now it's just a 3 star photo sorting program."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Google pics storing photos separately from the library is very annoying, especially because making a folder in one does not sync with the other. Also, the fact that you can't move pics from google pics to your library sucks. The fact that deleting photos from google pics also deletes the pic from your library even though the two don't communicate is just ridiculous. Overall, the entire setup is inefficient and cumbersome. The pushy ""memories"" feature is very obnoxious as well."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the way google photos app organizes the photos according to the most common features of each photo. Yet it also allows me to put in any keyword such as sunsets, sun rises, masquerade, etc. To find all of the photos in thay category almost instantly. It also has unique editting features, performing wonderful surgery on your photo memories. It even gives you the option of creating new products with your photos and videos. Such as collages, animations and movies."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Google photos has a problem with moving photos to a folder from another.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very clever and user friendly app. Merges pictures from camera and phone into single record which is safely backed up. Picks out best photos and automatically does great things with them. If you wish can enhance, manually crop and change colour and exposure balance of your favourite pictures with a high degree of control - it can really make a difference. You can create albums. I have learned to really enjoy using the app. Hats off to Google."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I don't even use my stock photos/gallery apps anymore! Google photos organises for me and is so easy to share with family and friends. Id give it 5 but have a couple of suggestions. 1. It would be fantastic if I could label faces that weren't detected in photos 2. ID like to be able to scan all of my albums and have it pick up duplicate photos and give me the option to delete those.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a wonderful app, you won't see many better, I recommend, please it'd look a lot nicer if you sorted all the pictures in the photos column, nobody wants to be seeing their screenshots all muddled up with photos taken by camera, or you can add an option to separate all pictures into categories (people, scanned papers, screenshots, scenes) in the photos column, so we can focus on What really matters"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Google calls out developers for not showing what is in the newest updates when this app never seemed to. Hypocritical Google! I have less faith in Google, thinking they are an exception to the rules. I'm done. I lost 2 years worth of photos with no explanation in chat. Photos kept deleting themselves so I'm sticking with Onedrive. It's more reliable."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Has been extremely helpful in my work -it's ability to have catalogued, timed and dated photos to support finding by face, year or month-just brilliant!!! So archiving is amazing. I'm now so reliant it's crazy -my own mini-brain!. I love how I can regurgitate the past on a whim and that it actually provides you with choices for review- love. HIGHLY recommend."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have been using google photos for years and never had a problem with storage or it slowing down my emails. I am not at all happy with the changes being made. I've been trying to remove my photos and get them all downloaded to a personal hard drive and there is no fast way to do it without losing the time stamp on my memories. This is ridiculous. Separate the email storage so people can continue to conduct business without having to create a new email address.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is wonderful, wish it can organize and find photos your looking for, separate documents videos and photos in a day separate. Also would love to see editing as well as create a project inside the app. Wish it would have more space instead of paying for the 1tb. I recommended this app instead of one drive. I don't like onedrive it takes forever."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I found the pictures from the and app flawless but I hate the set for being disappointing as it appears there are factory defects that should have been taken care off but ignored. The set always comatose once in audio, the last volume should have been the medium. It often get hung. The app should made the camera separate from video icon."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Generally this program has a lot of potential, but it is so difficult to share photos, which should be the main priority for a photo based application. For example, on the Google Pixel 6a you cannot post directly to Instagram besides stories, and generally it is made very inconvenient to do anything outside the app. Which is frustrating because the shared album feature and the variety of tools like the magic eraser are very cool, but inaccessibility gets in the way."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"One of the worst app to view photos. I have been using Samsung Gallery which is far better and the best for gallery. The samsung gallery app syncs with the folders created in the device. Unfortunately google photos failed to identify the folders created by the user in the device. All it does is add the pictures to one single folder. If you want to view that particular image, then hit on all images and search for the image so simple. Google should understand that we don't have all day for this."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"hello. my experience with this app is very much a hassle, i thought at first it would be similar to a vault where i can store my photos there and leave it be but now it keeps on backing up everything and there is no way out of it. Even if you toggle the backup button OFF it still collects screenshots which i absolutely despise. You can basically say it ruined my phone since my photos are very important to me. also the fact that the gallery and this app are linked with noway out is horrible."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"4 words, Can't flip a simple jpg :)"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love how it backs up my priceless photos. I can retrieve anytime even if they're deleted from my device. Being an advid photographer, I take a lot of images with my smart phone. Growing up using film, I find it amazing how much technology has devoleped through the years. Now don't forget to print your best images. Having a hard copy is the best to have in your album or to pass around to family or friends. It looks better on photo paper then passing around your phone."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"There has been a lot of improvement since the last time I reviewed this app. But there is still some work to do, especially in the naming of photos that were exported or syned from another device, these photos should always carry the original name as it was originally like when naming a photo with the date it was snapped and other info, these info should not be altered when the photos are imported into Google photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Where is the option to store photos into folders? I've migrated over to a pixel but pressing and holding on to the picture doesn't show the option to move to an existing folder.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Help! Just upgraded to the new s23 ultra. Made the switch over and went to open google photos. Only shows half of the pictures backed up. I went to the photos web page and they are all on there online but the app won't show them. I tried everything from reinstalling Photos app to deleting app data and cache. Trying to make it reset. Nothing is working! I just want my pictures back without having to go through an internet browser.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,So arbitrary and dumb that I can't remove a location from a photo that had it added by the camera. This stops me from sharing any media with anyone public online without first having to edit the media on PC to protect my privacy. What a stupid and privacy diminishing limitation.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"My main issue is that I'm constantly trying to find my photos after editing them. There is a feature that groups original photos with the edited ones, together in one ""file""...which results in me having to scroll forever to get to the original to find the newly edited one. This is such a departure from how my gallery used to be, before Google Photos, which I really miss."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app backs up my photos automatically and allows me to free up space with a click. All my pics are in the app and backed up in the cloud, so i can make lots more room by deleteing the gallery.I love how it makes ainmations out of my photos and movies as well.Whenever I go out of town & take pics while I'm away, or theres a holiday & I have taken pictures , this app always does something relevant and cute with them and then I decide what to save [i.e. some of the pics I took at christmas are in a movie titled ""Tis The Season""].Google Photos also archives my papers for me. It notifies me of a suggestion and then I choose the actual results.I can also very simply make movies, animations, albums, and etc with a click of a button and help of an ""assistant"". Now that Ive discovered Google photos I couldn't imagine not using it!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Fab, free reliable storage for images. Couple of problems i have is that there us no way of forcing GP to sync, i.e. You have done it once that day, then you want to sync again... It doesn't let you. Secondly, the share url generated does not work for website images. You have to rught click and copy imsge address to link on a Web page. This only seems to last for a short amount of time and sometimes not at all which is a shame. But its free, so i don't feel i should complain too much. All good !"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is the only photo app I would ever entertain. Its just so easy and straight forward to use. Great filters if you want them and it's easy to edit your photos. Lots of storage too. I like that the app suggests adjusting your photos if they need it. I love this app 100%. No problems in the years I have been using it. Its always Google all the way for me x x
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Getting worse with each upgrade. Recently the formerly clean and simple user interface was replaced by more clutter that can do less. At home we can stream Netflix to Chromecast in HD but this app can't even stream a small clip without stuttering. And now they're going to ask money for storage that isn't even unlimited. Google is giving competition a fair chance by making their products worse. Maybe that's a good thing but I don't understand how they design their software.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Storage suddenly becomes full even after deleting all most in side it and showing the mesage to by additional storage on per month basis
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I can take my photos anywhere I go and on any device...I love this app!!! This app is the only reason I have pics from 8 years ago off my babies and me together... Otherwise they would've been lost! Thank goodness for this app. It does have done issues with backing up pics and then I go in and find that they're not backed up anymore... And backing them up to my drive doesn't mean they're saved to my drive, sometimes either, but other than that, I love this app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App is only useful if you WANT every photo you take/screenshot/download with your phone to be uploaded automatically. I do not. I want to manually upload SOME of them and I have turned off the 'Backup and Sync' option, which does not work and despite that will STILL upload every photo. I find this to be an invasion of my privacy and have deleted the app and will be transferring all photos to a flash drive instead."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My Pixel 6 suddenly restarted out of nowhere and Google Photos started to duplicate all my photos and theeen it started to backup the duplicates !!! I restarted my phone again, the duplicates got fixed, but a part of my old photos is not opening. It is showing the thumbnails, but when clicking on them, it opens the same photo over and over. Plus, some dates have changed on the photos. I hope nothing is lost! Please do not suggest your standard links. I have tried all of them and nothing works!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is great for sending large amounts of photos to friends, but it needs a cancel button to be able to stop uploads without having to remove your Google Account from your phone. I sent a batch of 500 uncompressed Raw images by accident thinking that the app would automatically compress the images for my friends but it didn't. It is taking some hours now to just send a few photos. This is quite annoying."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I can no longer group photos under names. The app doesn't recognize anybody, and if I try to add a name, all I get is ""Error while labeling cluster."" Update: Tried updating as advised, but it was already updated.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's been a good app so far, never had problems with it and was all around pretty satisfied, but since 2 or 3 weeks ago I can't edit any of my pictures.

Why oh why, everytime there is an update to just about any app, the performance is not what is preached about, the new conditions are mostly intolerable at best. Are we being tested ??? Lost restored pictures, not on files , nowhere to be found. Why all the updates to later on have us performing tasks, that the savants who come up with updates, tell us to perform, and the problem is not fixed. Stop updates if you can't get it right."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Some great tools/options, but missing other essential stuff. As an example, I sort all my pictures on my phone in different folders (some are automatic like ""screenshots"" and ""downloads"", others I create myself), as I don't backup *all* my images. BUT stupid Google photos doesn't backup the folders, only bunches everything together, so I then have to go in and re-create all my folders and categories as ""albums"". Ok fine, the face recognition is fun to use, but I'd trade it for folder synching."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Super useful! In college on events like fests and farewells, all 60+ classmates would share an album, uploading all our photos in one place. It makes little animations and videos from similar photos or ones from a particular event and it understands which photos are garbage like forwards. I wish it would ask to delete them instead of archive them though."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really like this app. Mostly easy to use. Great Adjust options. Eyedrop color copy would be a great addition. But option to Rename file photos themselves would make organization much easier. Even w/ the recent update (Dec. 2022), my phone is LITERALLY OVERLOADED w/ files, photos, etc. taking up 95% storage. Locked Photos replacing Archive adds to the confusion. It's taking me HOURS of going through EVERY SINGLE PHOTO & trying to free up space using Drive & Backup."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's agreed that there is no better application of its kind, however it still misses some features almost every other gallery app has. Two of them I'm missing most: - Calendar selector to go to specific date - scrolling using the right-side ""timeline"" is too approximate and searching using text is too verbose/slow - Album labels: there are albums, you can put photos in them, and then... you never know which photos belongs to which album; just beats the purpose of organization."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I had to uninstall and reinstall because it says there is a bug. Now when I reinstalled some of the features such as magic eraser are gone. Annoying.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Getting rid of unlimited storage is ridiculous. Probably the biggest reason I came to a Google phone when they first came out after my Samsung note was recalled. I've gotta 3 of them and if it actually changes, I'll probably go to iphone which would be terrible. Also, it'd be nice to a have fast forward and rewind feature when watching and editing videos. Crazy something so simple has never been available."

Can you please add a search feature to look for a specific album name when adding photos. I have many albums. So it takes long time to scroll down a list of albums when you want to add photos to a specific album. Im sure the users need that feature too.

It helps that the software can group photos based on the faces. My gripe and honestly I really wish you would add this, is the Collage maker. Why can't you give us an option to edit the placement of the collages? I would be able to delete an app that I keep specifically for that."

It's impossible to edit collages & there's no way to customize. It puts random items in the trash but when u wanna trash a pic it won't get rid of it. Also no way to password protect selected photos like a folder that has a password. Little to no control over the organization of your photos. The ""editing"" is a joke even for a beginner."

It also gives you a history of photos you took on a significant date years ago which is very nostalgic. It's a great app to use and you will enjoy having your photos stored here. If you lose your device all you have to do is remember your Google account and password and you'll have access to your pictures again.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Just money grubbing nonsense!! Why is ""delete from device"" the only delete option? Why does editing a photo only give the error ""something went wrong""? Why is the default view in the app always a forever streaming list by date of thumbnails? Why is it the archive utility says 8 pix ""should be archived"" but only has 3, that are already ""selected"" and not scaled/zoomed so I can actually see which ones they are? . . .

Ya oky the cloud or buy more storage would work there are a lot of folks out there that simply cannot afford it. Google makes more money than God.

Only thing is, you start with 15gb that is very low and it's not for just Google photos, it's for every Google services such as drive, gmail, etc in one pack called Google one. There are 100gb, 200gb, 1tb subscriptions which can be shared to 5 peoples. Anyways, Google photos is realiable and good to make albums, and you can specificallu categorize each person or animals per album per their name. I think it's an awesome feature. Overall, loved it and recommended"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is okay coz i can retrieve most of my photos.. but am requesting for additional features... such as lock folder with a different password with that of the phone, easy to accesse and can be backed up incase am using a different phone or medium. The photos that we keep in lock folder are memories that we don't want to be deleted, loose them or may be to fall in wrong hands. But we loose them when we change our phones or when it's stolen. If you can add up folders in it the better."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Honestly with the amount of bugs and glitches this app has, I don't know why I should even update it, instead of deleting it. I used to really love this app because of the pictures I was able to back up, aswell as save storage space. As of lately I have been getting messages saying that ""google photos stopped"" and it signs me out of the app !!! Some of my pictures from years back have been deleted and I can't find them at all. To say that I'm annoyed would be an understatement. Please fix it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the photos app. The only thing I can think that should be different with it that i think i would do to the app overall is to not store the same photo more than once in different places, i.e. archive+library will have same photo in them. This can be confusing when trying to retrieve, or work with them. Makes it very difficult to find the ones you want if they can be found in several places and this has to use or affect storage somehow I would think."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Can't find the collages, stylized photos, animations, etc...even when I get a notification that Google created something like this for me automatically, I click that notification & it takes me to the app not the creation. I look everywhere but can never find what I'm looking for. Seems like the only thing I can find is the highlight reels from previous years ü§î seems like the 1st version I had was way better than any updates I've downloaded! This app should be top notch! Hey Google get with it!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Everything and more than what I thought this app could do for me. I can delete all videos off my phone freeing up lots of space which is what I wanted it to do. What I wasnt expecting was the app to roll my trip to london and Great ormand street or even just my friday night into a video picture collage for me without asking it to, then the app asks me to view and if I wish to save it. Excellent."

When sending a photo with the app to a contact via the stock messages app, the other party is unable to download the pics or unable to view it completely. If unable to view completely, they are sent a link to view the photo regardless of the share photo option NEVER being used by original sender. I'm unsure if it's the android software itself or a Google Photos issue but I'm 100% sure it IS a PAIN in the rear for myself & others!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Currently crashes all the time, closes everytime i try to do anything within the app. Photos I take don't save. I suspect it's what's causing all the other problems with other apps that utilise the camera, from updating. Phoned support for help, did the things suggested but still no different. Phone is becoming unusable. Update: Finally after a couple of months there was a software update which has fixed the problem."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I used to be able to put photos in a fb album when sharing to fb, but this doesn't work anymore (on BB Keyone); it will only put them in ""mobile uploads"" , even though it appears to be giving me the option of creating and adding them to an album. I don't know if this is a fb app issue (posted it to a review for that too), or a google photos issue, but it's a problem when travelling to have to rely on a desktop pc to manage the photos I upload with my phone."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"really great app, one of the few that constantly improves and rarely seems to take steps back. BUT I think it would be cool to 1. have some sort of collage option where we can edit photos how we want instead of it being made for us 2. having the option to save an original photo as the newly cropped one. so instead of ""save as new"" we just save the original one to the newly cropped specs."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why would you put camera filters behind a membership? You know that's going to just make people go to free apps for their photos now, right? Uninstalling, because needing a membership to simply edit your photos is a joke."

I accidentally turned it off and immediately turned it back on. When I'm trying to re-label my photos, it is giving me an error stating ""error while labeling cluster."" Please advise or fix the error to label the pictures. These are not new pics. These photos were already previously labeled from my saved contacts."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am still a big fan of Google photos. I was bummed out to hear of the new option to pay once you reach your storage limit. But I do believe this app helps you to cut down on unnecessary storage of undesired photos, accidental duplicates, & many more... I don't find that the app for the sake of making a buck steers you into gaining or having more space taken up.. just the opposite I think! Im thankful for this app, it had allowed me 2keep yrs worth of pictures organized neatly. Thank you!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app's sync and backup work great for videos and photos. But it feels outdated. Making albums out of photos makes for a terrible time for searching. It would be great if there was a manual tagging system that allows users to have the ability to create tags and organize photos. Filtering photos by multiple tags would definitely make searching for the right photo fast and easy. There are currently no app with both a tagging and backup/syncing functionality. Hope google photos can be the first.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,When photos backup from Google photos or any other third-party gallery app the folders you set up in them do not show in the cloud. Only these groupings from AI like pets and vacations. I'd like my pictures to back up in the folders that I have created. I've tried every setting for hours and can't figure out a way. I hope I'm missing something that you can suggest.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Recent changes on here has made this a more user friendly app. I am having trouble with some photos disappearing. I still haven't figured out how to look at photos that have been archived. It's features are helpful. Prompts are good reminders. Easy to understand help instructions.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"""Highlights"" is awful: Navigation is non-intuitive and there is no ""back"", only forward (by tapping on the image). Also, app is always trying to ""help"", tweaking every photo I take or assembling them in some way to convince me to purchase something from Google. Most annoying is, unlike every photo viewer app that exists, a left-swipe *deletes* whatever it is the app assembled for me, rather than advances the view to the next image."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's okay, I just figured that being from Google, would have been alot better. Hate that if something stored in the cloud, and play video again how incredibly slow it takes. Used iPhone 10,8 & 6, Blu 6.5 & Galaxy 10 & my ZTE Max (actually was faster than others).

"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Everything is great, expect two things 1. When I am deleting my photos it shows that it's deleted that time, but after some time it backs up...It's really annoying. 2.

Yes everyone tell it doesn't but I have experienced it many time with in this month's. I am getting annoyed with this. I searched everywhere but it's nowhere to be found. If there was other problems atleast I would have given 3 stars. Now I don't want to mention about it. I just hope that it can be fixed. It's reallyüò°üò°üò° annoying.

It takes forever to load and it puts photos in the wrong folders without my permission. The only thing I have access to is the large as f*** folder that mashes everything together, forcing me to scroll through thousands of unrelated pictures that I had previously neatly organized. It's like you're running late for a big party and a 2 year old takes all your jewelry and mixes it into one pile. Trash"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Hi Google photos. Your application is good but I'm confused because my photos in my album(application of my cellphone) are gone after I sync and back up all my photos and videos. And I really don't know what to do now. I'm really bothered to lose every moment I cherish to all that photos. Thank you. I hope that my concern reach you. More Power!
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Like the fact Google Photos shares between devices. That being said, the recent updates have made it less easy to use. It's more complicated to figure how to use my own photos to edit images. They black out if they're viewed in edit mode in other apps.

The only thing I would change is the users ability to save the beautiful creations Google Photos makes from their saved memories. I really wish I could save some of the highlights Google photos created for me from my photos. But, when I try to save them it will only save one photo at a time, not the whole lineup asa whole."

I lost my phones several times, backup my photos via Gmail then when i login with my previous details i get every gallery was lost & deleted but one problem is that it automatically backup pics and sometimes backup same picture, video several times and have same picture repeating more than twice, and that's filling up my phone storage with many repeating pictures"

"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. I originally got it to back up my phone when getting a new one but now love using it for photo storage on all my devices, album creation, sharing with others, and easy accessibility of photos across all devices. I love the automatic backup, having unlimited storage, and the reminders to clear up space on my phone knowing photos will still be easily accessible later. The only thing that could be improved is how long it takes to process videos. A 3-sec vid shouldn't take 6 hours."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Google dug up and used a FIFTEEN YEAR OLD payment method, which screwed up my accounting and I had to close the old account just to make Google stop trying to tap it for cash. Additionally, I ordered two photo books. One I got, the other was sent to a 20 year old address? Oh, and they make several animations for me, but I can only ever see one. Once I view one, the others disappears. It's all so disappointing. Should be as easy as they say. IT'S NOT!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The ability to sort photos for shared albums would be nice.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really like the app and many of its features. It keeps my photos in the same albums I have on my device making it easy to find. I gave about 8,000 photos stored so organization is very important to me. It could use improvement in how to do certain functions. Exaample: I wanted to use the ""cleanup"" function, but it doesn't show or tell me what's being cleaned. It says don't worry, they are all backed up in Google photos. It would be better if I had more control and knew where they are going."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely brilliant app, the algorithm that makes the videos and GIF's from pictures, videos and albums is wonderful. Truly a great app that i didn't realise had so much more than just a picture store. Since using it I've won over my daughter and wife to use on their phones too. The fact all of the videos and gifs are made automatically is a really nice suprise every other day or so. Thank you!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The ease of use, the ability to share folders with people across the world just by using the app and not having to click through multiple steps, it's awesome.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I wish they'd fix the auto-selection of facial recognition. Mostly it works well but sometimes it's way off from the face or it won't pick up one or all faces in the frame. I'd like to manually tag photos without the face detection. Also I don't know how to add location to images. It'd be nice if it were possible to have 'parent' albums and sublet albums like if I want an album of someone but I want to outline specific trips or memories.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I hate that this is the only option I have on my pos phone. Google photos ruins photo quality, takes forever to manage pictures (seriously up to a minute to delete under 10 pics are you kidding me) and if you happen to want to share a pic you have to be careful or you might share your whole album to them and not even realize. I can't imagine being non tech savvy and trying to use this garbage app I'd probably just throw the whole phone away."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I wonder why there is no ""Sort by"" option provided in the app to sort albums in the desired manner to make searching for photos easier. It's hard to search through for the desired content from tons of content available in tons of albums in my gallery. Everything else is good, I like the app a lot. Great job by the devs, thank you. Removed 1 star for the lack of ""Sort by"" option. I'll change it to 5 stars once the ""Sort by"" feature is added."

As a cherry on the top, ease of access of its all features and options paint the accurate picture of the app's great capacity.

Keep it up, guys!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Both logos are good. But I do like this one more. Even tho, I don't have much to say about it. But it is a good app. I download a bunch of stuff and the images go really clear and clean. The only problem is the album. When you show a link and to it again without copying the link it makes another album of the video you're shearing. Wish album is better. But nether less. It's a good app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Firstly, I used to love this app. And if the improvements were made I'd go back to 5*. Unfortunately over the last few weeks it's just not been working as it should . My data has gone through the roof & I haven't changed the number of photos. Also, uploads are taking days if not weeks to back up. This used to be such a reliable backup but now its not the case. I've troubleshooted, followed all to try and solved this but the new update seems to be the issue."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Uploads difficult to manage or pause for later. Or even know which photos have been done or not. Just get a progress bar Need to be able to stop it when WiFi load is minimal. Toggling off backup sync not effective. Re sync - option to choose which folders to sync from camera instead of everything trying to go at once.. Otherwise good to know photos are accessible.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I think the app is really good but I gave it a three star rating because when backing up your photos you have to mark the photos you want to backup and let's say you have like a thousand photos you have to mark all of it because there is no option for select all in this app, and marking all this could be really stressful,so change that and then I will give it a five star rating. But apart from that the app is really great and works fine."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Do not use. Backup and sync re-enabled itself after an update and filled my storage. I can't use Gmail now and when I try to delete, this invasive app deletes the photo/video from my phone too. I tried moving photos to a different (un-synced) folder on my SD card and it deleted them from there too. I turned off permissions and now can't use the app. I'll have to move files off the phone and then delete and THEN hope the next update doesn't turn back up and sync back on."

I accidently clicked the ""Clear Storage"" option and this cleared thousands of my photos from gallery without giving me a single warning! It took almost 3-4 hours to restore all the photos. It's very sad to say that there are options for ""Deleting Photos"" everywhere but there is no option for ""Restoring Multiple Photos"". A lots of people are also victim of this. I'd appreciate if you add an option for restoring multiple photos in gallery and give us a warning before deleting."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Oct 1st - Horrible redesign for editors. Edits to ""saved copies"" are baked in, so you can no longer ""revert"" edits to saved copies, meaning only ONE ""revertible"" version of any photo. Sliders replaced with numerical values, which is NOT editor-friendly. Can no longer see multiple sliders at once, meaning no more useful bird's-eye view of edits. No longer have the ""light"" and ""color"" sliders, which made multiple, balanced changes with a single slider. (Also - blur feature taken away.)"

I've been probably trying to upload some pictures for days, forcing me to use another clouds.

But all of those come up at that instant only so I cannot enumerate them here, however Google should always be on the search for updates to make the accessibility of options and customisation of settings constantly.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't enjoy leaving bad reviews, but it asked. This is the least user friendly thing on my phone. And the browser one is not better. The app thinks it knows what I want better than I, and does not respect how I wish to organize my photos. Not to mention it straight up does not show uploaded photos, unless I specifically search for them. Does show albums it creates though... And I cannot disable those. So now I have an album consisting of a pic of a shoe, but not my recently uploaded photos."

It would be wonderful if we can type the general/specific area and the map takes us to that area (as in Google maps) and shows us density of pictures in that area. As off now we have to zoom in and out of the areas, typing and going and directly to areas as in Google maps would be so awesome. If our searched areas has no pictures the app can report that to us, but that would be so convenient."

One big obvious issue unfortunately: It seems the backing up part is well done throughout but the redownload feature is completely missing. You will have to painstakingly download one image at a time. The user freedom on this app is very minuscule. It sure makes for a simple service but it inturn you give up full control of your own photos... It asks you to clean up ur storage by deleting backed up images, but then it's only accessible through this app and google!!!!"

I can easily go back and reference photos from specific dates, it auto sorts them into family events and trips, and with a facial recognition software even sorted by the people so I can easily go back and find photos. It takes a little time to get used to, because it's a little creepy at first to watch the app sort your pictures by facial recognition, it's a little 1984 I suppose, but it's really cool."

I did not block anyone and it is absurd that I seem to be blocked from my own albums but can add to those of friends. There are several forum threads on this issue stretching on for years by different people. Google gives a default handwaving response, followed by locking the thread and leaving the situation unresolved."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app has many great features but there is one really bad feature that negates all the good things. Backup photos does not organize media into device folders! I clicked on free up space button and without any warning it moved all my device photos into one big photos section on Google photos. I lost all my organized folder structure from past 2 years. It is going to be a big pain for me to sit and create so many albums manually again on Google photos. Very disappointed.

Getting the perfect brightness on the cloud can make them washed out on my phone. U control if i can save edits to my original or only to a copy. I should decide. Which pics are avail on phone is chaos! No response to feedback.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Safe and fast. It's almost like a cloud where you can storage your photos. I set the app to download every photo I take. Then, I clear up space from Android and voila! I like how Google photos gives you editing suggestions and you can organize photos by creating albums. So convenient, easy and the best is - Free!!! Unlike other apps they charge your for extra tiny space."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I can't stand this app. It deleted sooo many of my photos without any input from me. You can't share photos from a created folder on Facebook without a link that redirects to google photos. The app automatically reverse photos in animations and they can't be manually corrected by rearanging them. You can't add or remove photos to or from a created album in full screen mode, only in album view, so you have to open and close photos constantly to organize an album and choose good photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's been an awesome exp using Google Photos, above any other app I've tried. Unlimited, seamless high quality backups is an unbeatable service and gives me so much peace of mind. Love the features in ""For you"" that really make it personal, esp ""Rediscover this day"" which is always a nice moment of calibrating memories and how time has passed. ""People & Pets"" face grouping is a great feature I always use, though pets are not so accurate. ""Free up space"" is an easy one-tap I could not do without."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"it was great until the new update. the newest version update is awefull, it messes up photos backup and syncing between devices. everytime i added photos to an album on one device, they didn't show in the same album on a different device. the photos were in the account alright, but weren't synced into the album in thw other device. had to add them via google photos website in browser. please fix it right away."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very good application, efficient and easy way to access something online. It unable people take good pictures edit at will and print them as required. And sending pictures and documents soft copies are easy and cost effective. Google photos can make one see places that would be impossible for many people to go or see. Sometimes undesirable advertising and news or informations are a bit worrying, but the advantages are over the disadvantages and therefore better to use than other apps"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"from this latest update: it just enhanced some of the feature that the app has, but it doesn't really make me find my photos easily, especially if it comes from the other apps. it just mixed my photos together with the backed up one. those albums that is from other apps, i usually find it from google photos but it doesn't let me find it easily. as well as the last update, it still need to close the app to finally make your photos be backed up, if you don't, it just loads."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Great app, except, recent updates have removed the ability to save edited photos, instead the app saves the edited version locally on your device meaning you have to re upload, throwing out any order in which they were taken. with nearly 150 photos on one day on holiday that need editing this has proved and is still proving an absolute nightmare. Google. please fix. The save a copy option is good but sometimes we don't need to keep the original, merely update the original images. please fix this."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Once I archive photos in Google photos I am no longer able to save to device anymore. I am really unhappy about this. Why was this feature taken away??? Also, all my pictures turn sideways. I have to edit every single one. I thought might be my phone but, I have a new phone and it still does it. It never used to but after an update months ago, maybe even February 2022, it started doibg it. A fix would be appreciated or a setting I can change."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"An evil app. Even if I delete any file from Google photos with backup and sync feature enabled or disabled, using either the same mobile device or PC, the photos from mobile storage gets deleted. I should be able to choose which file to backup without compromising my storage. A video recorded with my phone got uploaded in Google photos, after which I couldn't even delete from Google photos because of low space. I had to buy the premium package to even delete that. Uninstalled it immediately."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Google photos. The settings are easy to set up and understand. It gives me peace of mind knowing my memories are saved to my account when I connect to wifi, without me having to go through and select each photo. With Google set up on all my devices, I am able to easily access my photos. Sharing photos with friends and family is so easy, creating an album everyone can see, add to and view has saved me so much time."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"When I try deleting things from Google photos, they also get deleted from the synced devices and there's no other option?? The point of having Google photos was to move part of the photos to the cloud and leave part on the phone, but everything got backed up automatically and now I can't touch them from the clouf bcs they will get deleted everywhere."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This has so many great features. It was a 5 star app until they changed to make photos part of your Google Drive storage space. I've had an email with them from the beginning, and there is not much space to add every photo. The unlimited photo space, along with the features make this the only app you'd ever want. Now it matches the features of many other apps (i.e. OneDrive)."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ridiculous that photographs are sorted in to a stream instead of folders - makes it almost impossible to sort and organise photographs - makes finding photographs laborious and time consuming. Much prefer the Samsung version where images get put into a camera folder and can then be sorted into any other albums you want to make. You can duplicate images into different folders if you would like. It makes for a much easier digital workflow as opposed to scrolling back through thousands of photos
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is really frustrating. My partner and I created a shared album for our holiday photos and it worked fine the first day. But after that we could only see our own photos. We've updated, cleared cache, reinstalled and rebooted our phones. After rebooting she can no longer see her photos in the album and some have disappeared from Google photos. Really not functional. And aside from this, not having the ability to sort by date taken is a pain. Especially when the data is there and available"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app, just wish my account could be a little more secure. I've had quite a few issues with repeatitive hacking incidents. And lost control of accounts without being able to regain them from Google. Even when I knew all the back up info especially having the same phone number still to verify its me. I've lost quite a bit of data from this and it's incredibly frustrating. If anyone knows of a better independent storage option please comment and let me know."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"How on earth can I change the order of the photos in the app, so that the most recent ones will be shown as I scroll down at the bottom, or scroll right when I am looking at the photos? Pictures were displayed that way on my old Nokia phone, it's much more intuitive, and I simply can't find a setting to change it in this app, if it even exists. If that worked this would be a 5 star app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This a very good app. I can store all my memories in it. Editing options are brilliant. It also has a plenty of space, even albums can be created. Now here is the reason why I did not give it full 5 stars. Some days before, when I used to edit a picture, SAVE and SAVE AS COPY options were there. But after updating THE 'SAVE' OPTION WAS GONE. IT WAS NOT THERE. ONLY THE SAVE AS COPY OPTION WAS THERE AND THEN I'LL HAVE TO DELETE THE ORIGINAL PICTURE TO LET THE ORIGINAL ONE ONLY REMAIN. Can you fix?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Google photos was the most trustworthy service and software I ever came across, there's no other service I called more essential, it was a go to fix for a lot of things. Because of these reasons I always ignored the buggy app, inability to download multiple media at once or even the lag in making tiny edits. Ever since the new storage policy update, I have felt nothing but remorse over having such faith in Google, I was well aware of the monopolization, just never knew they'd pull a cheap move."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"In the new update pixel camera when we set ultra hd on and then upload pictures to Google photos and then download them on our computer. The downloaded photos will have blank tags and all the data about when the picture was taken, the geo tag and what device took it is all lost."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I never enabled backup or sync for my phone, when I saw that all my photos were archived I didn't know that this app was somehow directly saving all my camera photos to Google photos, I just guessed I accidently enabled and disabled it sometime recently so I assumed because I turned the backup and sync off (it was already off before) it would not matter if I had disabled the app. When I did that, it synced and deleted 2 years of photos forever. I can't even uninstall it, this app is spyware."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Over the course of an hour, this app burned through 8gb of data when background restrictions are in place and syncing is turned off. It looks like photos just decided to ignore all settings and upload huge video files without my permission on cellular data!

"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google photos is a GREAT app. It has saved all my photos from different devices into one place and when my phone broke, I didn't lose any. There are great grouping of photos for people, places and things. It is easy to search up a photo you are looking for. Although I wish Google photos would sync with my camera roll both ways, or that there would be a button to make it the default photos app and then I can easily share my Google photos from the WhatsApp or Instagram app."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have six different Gmail accounts for very specific reasons and attempts to save things like photos to specific drives never get saved in the proper drives. As a result, now they're trying to charge me to upgrade for more storage when if they did their work properly, I wouldn't need. Not happy. I've complained before and it just keeps happening."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's an ok. app, all things considered. Although streaming videos (whether in my browser, on my PC, or Smartphone) is a very unsatisfactory experience, due to stuttering and I have 350mbps so this should not be an issue - I can barely pre-view videos and it takes far too long to buffer them thus almost making it easier for me to download them, rather than pre-viewing, Also unable to rotate the video. Not to mention that its 'fix lighting' feature is completely useless."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ever since the last update my photos won't move to other folders, if they move a corrupted copy will be left behind in the original folder and if I try to delete the corrupted photo, the uncorrupted version will also delete. It's very annoying. Also now my photos are just becoming blank files, they'll show up blank in the camera roll and they don't load when I click on them."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Google Photos used to work really well across all my devices, but now the app freezes and restarts all the time. This happens especially when a photo is selected and then an attempt is made to enlarge a portion of the photo on screen. The screen usually freezes or goes partially black most times. Please can you fix this glitch Google. It's been going on for way too long."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love the service that Google photos offers, but there are issues with syncing across devices. A shared album created on one device either doesn't appear on another device, or it appears but is empty. This is between an android device and ios. It doesn't happen all the time but it is frustrating when it does."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"it's fine. but I wish it would go back to organizing it by day and not by the full month. it's harder for me to organize everything. and I hate the ""shots available"" that shows up on every single video.

I just want the videos and I can't scroll through the video as easy when I have to exit out the stupid ""shots available"" on every video."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"No differentiation(symbolic display etc) of either folders have been fully backed up or not. They have this weird option i.e., ""free up space"", if you use it they won't let ya know which of the photos/ albums is being cleared.The camera album, you can't turn off the back up, if you do so,you can't back up other albums separately, wow! No confirmation or percentage display about back up progress on individual album. You think that album is backed up, you delete the device folder and it's gone."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This will make it really easy to backup ALL your photos, including the bad ones that you'd really rather delete. Then it will fill up your available free storage and will want to sell you more. All while making it ridiculously obtuse to find and remove them from storage. I felt railroaded into paying for more space, but eventually was able to clear up our accounts so that we could at least use email. I won't be using it for backup."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"In this generation of saving pictures and videos in phones and cloud, we have forgotten the usage of old fashioned albums. But with google photos, your images on certain occassion will be saved automatically in an album.

It'd be great if there's an option where the user could group the faces by himself. That would be an amazing option.

Done that several times. It works for a day and then the exact same problem occurs the next day. Definitely a bug. Update: tried everything that was suggested and nothing has worked. This is obviously a bug. So I've switched to Amazon Photos until Google is serious about fixing this problem."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Free storage and back ups is great, but there is almost no way to tell which photos have been backed up and which ones haven't, which is the whole point. Using the 'free up space' option never deletes all of your photos, even if they are backed up. The best way to find photos that were backed up and delete them from your device was through the 'Delete from device' option, which would tell you if they were backed up before deleting them, but for some reason they've now removed that from the app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The update removed a number of features! UPDATE: Nov 6, 2021. Are they bribing me to leave + comment? Furthermore, you cannot even OPEN the app until you click ""UPDATE"", but then you have to immediately click ""No thanks"" before you can view any pictures. In other words, it FORCES you to take an update when it wants you to THINK they are giving you an option to update as they say, ""You're missing out!"" I could say more but I am Ltd to the # of characters."

The problem is that it saves every single picture that you take, even those that you already deleted from your phone. A huge improvement would be if it would ask you which pictures you want to save and, of course, not saving the ones that you already deleted. The other thing that annoys me is that in my phone I have pictures classified in albums, but when they are saved in Google Photos those albums disappear. #√ó$^/@=^%√∑"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app works wonders, especially with its unlimited cloud storage option with a tad bit of compression, but that's fine. The UI is smooth and not too complex and doesn't bug out. The integrated Photo editor is precise and what you'd ever need in a one size fits all package. The integration with Google's AI is incredible. I only find the lack of manually tagging faces as people irritating, I can't manually choose images of people to go into their specific albums, rest assured the app is one of the best on the market."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This the worst photo app ever made. It have an option to (free up space)and I did it after I do the backup, then all of sudden all my 6GB photos are disappeared.. Not only that, I mailed them like a hundred times since then but without a single response.. I tried to go through all the suggestion they wrote in the setting but for the last one month the results are nothing. Stupid app.. Careless support centre."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"As always, no-one can do it better than Google. Amazing artificial intelligence at display with top notch search features and auto generated collages/animations. It gives the idea of taking photos and storing them, a whole new dynamic. Paired with my Pixel device with unlimited storage for Photos, it gives me another reason to click pictures. Thank you Google."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app for storing my photos. However, I resent 'remember the day' where images of an ex boyfriend pop up in a collage, when you're trying to forget them! Don't do this Google, it's really unpleasant and intrusive. Also annoying for me are the stylised photos, which are pretty poor. I like to stylised my own (I'm quite good at it actually)."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"We all take photos... and then forget them (or post on a social site, get some likes and cheers, and then forget them)... the best part about Google's app is not only that it offers near professional quality controls (and by that I mean it is very tough to take a poor photo, what with AI enhancements and all) but the follow up process is par excellence as well... photo styling, phito books, animations.. those are often what i have found myself coming back to, more than the original photos."

I used it for about 2 years before my first account ran out of storage. I am using my alternate account to save now. I haven't paid a penny which I am also really grateful for. I love the assistant!!!! I just wish there was guaranteed unlimited storage, but that's probably just a fantasy lol"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very good app. One missing feature (from the functions, or from the description...I can't find it..) is the ability to download a block of pictures rather than individually. I've lost a few months from a failed phone. It's great to have them backed up but a pain to select and download individually. üëç"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Super frustrating app. I added images to Google photos on my computer then try to use them on my phone to post on socials, and the album is nowhere to be found on my app.... The settings for backing up phone photos is also super confusing and not user friendly. Search option is useless. Plus, I keep turning off face recognition, i find it creepy but it keeps doing it anyway. I pay for the storage every month yet can't use it because backup features are just way to confusing."

I came across photos I hadn't taken and didn't know we're there until I was trying to clean up my phone for space. Thanks guy's really saved an embarrassing thing. At the moment I can't explain but I think it's time I learned the functions of the camera and video opportunities that come with this LG Stylo handset computer, iPad phone on steroids. Lol"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I absolutely hate it! I see all these people who are ecstatic over it. I had several files with pictures and during the updating it completely cleared or emptied at least a dozen. The files are all still listed but they are empty. Once or if I can retrieve I most definitely will use a different app!

"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this app. I store all my pics and vids here in this cloud app. It's super cool to create albums/cologes and easy to send any pic to anyone. Or any album. The app also creates albums automatically, and you can choose to delete it keep them. The app also connects ""like"" photos with the similar pics to make organization easy. I also use the Gallery Go App to edit pics the way you want. Then store in HD quality w/unlimited storage for free. Love the Gboard, best keyboard imo. Thanks Google üòÉüëç!"

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It is a stupid insane nightmare that you can't download multiple photos on google photos. I'm going to see if a third party client can download everything, then remove every single file from photos and drive, and then I'm never using google photos or drive again. Google has come to be like a totalitarian government, herding and coercing people to do things their way or the highway. I choose the highway. I'm considering a non-android phone as well. Enough is enough."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The fact that I can't download more than one photo at a time from Google Photos to my phone storage is absolutely ridiculous, especially when I'm using a Google Pixel phone. I can click on a single photo and select 'Download' but once multiple images are selected that feature isn't available. More and more likely I'll be switching to iPhone next time I upgrade."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Update: Look like I'm done with this app. Terrible app. When your photos are backed up, it disappears into a black hole - eventually they're gone. Once backed up, the photos are placed into online folders like people, places, food and so on - if they don't fall into one of those categories, good luck finding the others. I have hundreds of pics that are gone. The whole experience is confusing to navigate. I'll be switching completely to Amazon pics to see if they're better and less confusing."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Recently there was an update and the albums are kind of harder to find, and I feel like it's just not as functional. Bad update. also they should really consider putting in an option to arrange photos. Not just with the search feature or in an album but actually arrange the photos. In large uploads they tend to get scattered."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You can't download multiple pictures/videos to your device at once. This means you have to download each picture/video individually, which makes the whole process way longer. What bugs me the most is that you were able to download multiple things at once before, but after the last couple of updates, you can't do it now. Google is purposefully making the transfer process more tedious to prevent people from doing it so you keep on paying for their service. This app used to be good but now it isn't"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"great app. backs up all your photos and videos, able to create albums and sharing features. Avoids just having thousands of pictures in your phone and not being able to find them. I would suggest Google to have a map feature with the location of all the photos in Google Photos without having to create a custom Google My Map. Similar to the Samsung feature within the Gallery."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Google photos used to be the absolute best photo editor/storage app. Nothing came close. Recent UI updates have made the user experience worse rather than better which is a real shame. Editing images is now a clunky process. Further to this, since Google will be changing their terms and conditions in June. the app and service has become a lot less desirable. Since Google has done a classic bait and switch, I'll shop around for a new service."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Have went and deleted SO MUCH from throughout the years to make more space but it still says I don't have enough. I can't text,create new albums, I turned off the auto backing. No matter how much I delete, I still manage to lose space. When I'm deleting WAY more than I'm adding! I mean hours of deleting. So now I have to pay. Which I find the whole thing to be BS EDIT: I have already tried what you suggested. I start off with 7 photos not being backed. Delete and then 11 photos aren't backed"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great features and enhancements to make your photos shine. I like the sharing feature and ability to edit and back up your photos. Not used the photo album feature but I'm sure I'll make use of this in the future. I have a DSLR camera and it syncs well to the Nikon app, meaning, I don't have to mess around when downloading photos or worry about using other editing tools. Google photos takes care of it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"an OK app, but can't do the simple, but very necessary things like renaming a file, what's that all about, no good adding supposedly great things, if it can't do the basics... After more than a years worth of updates, you still can't rename a file from inside the app, I can do that in the most basic of apps but you just can't do it in this one........ Rubbish."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Once again the engineers should be ashamed of themselves. Pre-installed on my phone and Lacks most of the standard features that the photo gallery on my last four Samsung devices had.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I give this a 4/5 for just one reason and it's the only problem I've been having with it. So the idea of syncing your photos onto this platform is helpful for those memorable photos that you share with yourself or many. The issue is, I dont want every photo from Google Photos to get removed from your device. Itll read off as synced device and if it could be possible to atleast make a setting to remove synced devices when deleting itd really help out. Please look into to this."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"With the change to limited storage this app now sucks. The constant pressure to buy more storage is ridiculous. I am going to buy a hard drive and store my photos on it. In the long run that will save me money. I can even buy a second HD to run as a backup of the first. Storage is cheap these days so why the limits, if not a new business model to get those who don't know how to transfer photos hooked on paying monthly fees or loose their memories."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google Photos is straightforward, easy to follow and understand. I feel my photos and videos are more safe with them than on my phone. If I lost my phone, I would still have my much loved photos. They are extremely valuable (emotionally) to me. If I need my photos for printing, or to just look at, I know there would be no problem accessing them."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Team Google, it is really a good app that can be very much useful to free up storage and to access them anytime & anywhere. But in my point of view, I feel there should be few changes. They're - ***Number 1*** The pictures those have been added to albums already are awkward to appear in the photos column. Solution can be that those pictures should be removed from the photos column or the ""photos column"" should be hidden in the bottom. ***Number 2*** The albums good would've look good, if it is able to create sub-albums inside an album. ***Number 3*** Inbuilt app lock for photos app ***Number 4*** Inbuilt folder/album lockers to set the privacy in a perfect way. Hoping a response from the #google team to check my feedback for letting me know that giving a feedback to you is no waste of time."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Really like this app! Has useful features and not to many gimmicks/bloat. Takes a bit to familiarise with all features if you want to use them, otherwise works to whatever level you choose, without making you feel overwhelmed. Has an attractive, uncluttered design‚Äî impressive considering all the features. Also appreciate the new storage-focused plan. My one suggestion; something I think could be a big level up‚Äîan easy, simple video cropping tool, to help save only the best bits of big videos! A+"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Photos separates your photos in your drive from your albums, doesn't give you control of what ends up where, and makes photos inaccessible to other apps. If you delete photos on your phone, they'll come back from the cloud. If you delete them from the cloud they'll come back from your phone. This is unbelievably bad synchronization for having been out this many years."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Very efficient. Yet I must admit I confuse some of the features almost interchangeably with Google Drive compared to Google photos yet Google Drive is most likely meant for things Beyond certain photos and videos type of content. Great they have a way to backup device content and even sync it to other devices. Google photos is very efficient practical and I think in some cases low data usage and the photo link option which also includes video can be a very nice option to have. Thanks

"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoy this photo app,it keeps me organized and shows me ""back in time"" pic's that I have the option of sharing it making a collage. Google is very smart ü§ì"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is extremely confusing to navigate. It's not intuitive at all, but the most annoying thing about it is is the share in google photos that pops up on top everytime you try to share a photo. I never want to share in google photo's but frequently end up doing it by accident. Worst yet. You can not turn this feature off. Another instance of Google trying to take over life and nose into every detail of it."

Due to lots if person everytime i follow the process for a person Please provide option in photos pin to person on top. And msg me on gmail after provide this update"

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ran out of storage and tried to delete photos from Google photos, which then deletes photos from my phone. My subscription had ran out by this point, so to get back the deleted photos, I had to re-subscribe. Absolutely shocking greedy, money grabbing scum"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The updates this app has gone thru over the years is impressive and having a pixel 6 really brings out the best the app is capable of and I'm sure it's better with better pixels
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Absolutely outstanding! I think those leaving 1 star ratings for this app need to follow the very simple instructions and then they wouldn't have an issue.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Lots of neat features, but I wish it were easier to customize which ones are available on each pic. Sure, I get suggestions to blur some backgrounds, but what about on other pictures? I can crop, but what if I want to save over the orig instead of saving a copy then going back to delete the orig after? Etc etc. And organization options could be more robust."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app gets photos from various devices, which is nice, but it uploads every photo and video to every Google account! I have my work email and my personal email on my phone and I certainly don't want my pictures and videos on my work account! But, it doesn't allow me to delete everything, or anything for that matter, without deleting it from my device and my personal account. Even trying solutions I find online, I've had zero success and maximum frustration!!! Choose a different app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Latest update doesn't seem to include photo stack or automatic categorization. Wish you would add a duplicate finder.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best Photo App Ever! It's like a digital scrapbook/journal that dose the hard work for you. Google Photos makes photo keeping effortless with the auto-back up, endless storage. Plus all the fun easy to use features to help you personalize your pictures. I love how interactive the app is with its face recognitions, movies, colleges, and slide shows Google photos makes to show you a preview with the date of the photos and suggestive filters. Trust me You'll love it!!üòÅ"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Got the brand new pixel for editing features, just got the app to keep saying ""unable to save photo"" every time I make any kind of edit."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I just got a notification saying there's an update available for this app would I like to update it. I clicked yes but there's no way for me to update it. It's either uninstall or open the app.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've learned to use it and I like it very much now üòäüåûüòâ. It wasn't the app, it was the idiot trying to use it, ME. I love the way it shows me pictures from 4 & 5 years ago that I took and forgot about. I can't think of any changes, it's a GOOD APP....."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I find this app really frustrating. I open it to see things from today and it may show today or it may show a random selection of my cat, or it may show things from four years ago. Useful software needs to be consistent. This cutsie ""photo album"" stuff makes it stupid. Clearly someone over at google is having fun, amusing themselves, and making it look like they are working by constantly changing things. But that seems to be the whole point of this app. The user has been forgotten."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My pictures and videos keep getting corrupted, and its spread trough the backup and sync feature I thought was supposed to prevent loss of data. Now I've got a whole bunch of unique pictures with high sentimental value that are ending up with huge grey squares at the bottom, colors all wrong, and all kinds of noise and other faults..... and the destroyed pictures have overwritten the copies stored on my computer/phone. FIX PLEASE, and restore my pictures.."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hands down the best photo app out there. Even on an iPhone, I prefer the Google photo app 100 times better than the apple photo app. I don't have to pay for storage with Google while I'd have to pay for storage with apple. The face recognition is much better in Google vs apple. Same for object recognition, animals, you name it. It's incomparable. The syncing between devices is seamless."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Stay away if you shoot a lot of photos. Very hard to get rid of should you want to, gets full fast and affects everything including emails! Yes they just bounce back and lost forever... when you do reach that point there are daily push notifications to buy space and physical albums..."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Photos get stored in the aether unavailable to other apps. Date and time organization is impossible to navigate. Clunky. Albums aren't saved on device impossible to share anything.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,If i use this is my new phone then all old data comes to it but not in well formed manner all screen shots whats images photos comes in a single slot it have to be like it like it was nice represtation of photos üò°
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It does not sync to my photo gallery, even with every setting to allow constant backup active. It is thousands of photos behind, and it doesn't back up unless I am on the app. Again, all of my proper settings are on... so is this a glitch only on my phone? I keep updating it but it never fixes itself. When it worked, it was the best photo app in the world."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's awesome. I love the memories collages it creates. The suggestions. Literally everything. The ONLY thing that I wish was better was the speed at which it backs up my photos from the past. But there were a lot before I started using this app, and I keep it at original quality. Only 1900 to go finally. Started with over 10k several months ago. I won't complain as this app has been a great tool to help backup photos and vids of our toddler twins."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Photos Disappearing! I have my photos set up to backup to Google Photos to keep my phone from getting overwhelmed. After a birthday event, all the pictures I had backed up disappeared. I thought it was user error so was just disappointed. However, today I backed up my pictures and deleted them from my phone and now a whole day of pictures is missing. This is pretty infuriating. I am seriously reconsidering this app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I am not able to add text while creating album in photos.... yesterday it was all fine but now its not working......and also i commented before on 2021 no one responded...
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I have Google photos on my computer and Samsung. I cannot see all the photos on my Samsung. When I'm dropping photos from an SD card do I put them in Google Photos or the G drive Google created with my backup plan?
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Please allow for the turning off the of the Memories feature. I don't need AI to group my pictures for me. I delete them all and it keeps generating Memories for me it's annoying as heck.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have lots of minor issues with this, but my main criticisms are to do with flexibility and privacy. First example: the organisation of pics is too automated and regimented, such as in the creation of folders and if I download a pic, I want to decide where it's saved. Second example: utilities = a silent slideshow/movie is easy; but if I try to use my own audio, the ""use My Music"" option leads to an empty folder with no obvious way to add (e.g.) a voice recording already on the phone."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"No restore option for a bulk restore. Cloud storage of something that belongs to me should allow me to move files wherever I want, PC or phone. This is not cloud storage it is a hostage situation with a very poor app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Everytime need to give it for back up. Please kindly change version fast... Users r not all happy with this latest updation . Everytime we can spend our time for Updation. Auto updating in back up is nesscesary.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The app doesn't allow me to share photos with my son. I tried to download the link several times and it failed each time. There's no way to contact Google to fix it.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Only one problem. When commenting on a photo, I was not sure in what line to type my review and of course it was in the wrong space. Now to go back and fix it, I can't, for it , I cannot delete it, it's sealed in stone."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's very convenient having your photos backed up to a cloud....when it works that is. I don't like the fact that Google is grouping older photos together not based on the time they were taken, so I'm having to sort thru 10,000 photos searching for one I took in December 2015. But when you lose your phone or important pics it's nice finding them safely in the cloud. Or maddening when you don't. It's odd that all my pics get uploaded except the very one I'm looking for. Very odd."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The worst! Do not install if you have important photos on phone. Keeps deleting my photos from gallery as an ""free up device storage"" option. You can't turn it off, you can't select which folder it deletes, doesn't even ask you before deleting. Solution? Stop backup and sync on phone which completely defeats the whole idea of having the app installed. I lost all my family photos permanently! I deleted them from the app thinking I already have it on my phone. No way of getting them back. Worst!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,All of my photos have gone haywire. They have the correct date/time info on them but in the app they're all out of order!! It's driving me nuts. Any fixes for this???

And i won't get half of my photos back. I have to switch off and on, and have to load for many times to get all my photos please see about it.üôÅüôÅ. It automatically back-up but nearly half of my photos are getting missed. Why??? Please look into it."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Missing the most basic feature. YOU CANNOT DOWNLOAD MORE THAN ONE PICTURE AT A TIME. You used to be able to. Now when you select multiple photos, and tap the three dots the option doesn't show. Google turing to garbage every day, on every single app. They are discontinuing cloud print, and WEAR OS is in complete shambles. How do you even call yourself Google?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,force stop all the time. I updated it but still can't work well. It's useless for me to pay monthly dor more storage if I can't use my own gphotos with new features
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Keeps closing on me when I'm trying to delete and clear out old videos and pictures.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,very useful in recovering photos that has been deleted from your phone. As long as you back up with google you will always see your photos.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"""Clear storage"" , don't warn me will delete all pics and video from phone. You should put option what folders to delete.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's good app & all. I do like the ""use as"" feature, but I'm disappointed it allows that feature for photos only. I want to be able to set a video as my home & lock screen. One that I've downloaded or for future video downloads. Google, if you would implement this feature for your users so that we can download videos to ""use as"" home & lock screen, you would have very happy users, myself included. Please allow this, it would make us very happy & satisfied."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Will you care to organise the backed up features in the same folder as my phone!! It will make navigation much smoother! It's really a pain to navigate by dates when i am just looking for a great pic of mine. Yes,face based albums are available but you can't use them when you're trying to export a picture, like setting a profile picture gives me goosebumps! Please stay organized!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Getting worst experience in this year , forcing me to create backup, also I lost many photos, forcing us to get one subscription ,I like previous version of Google photos"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm tired of the Google photos best shot and the constant suggestions when I view each picture. A message pops up on each picture, either saying, fix lighting, order photo, rotate screen, archive, etc. It's annoying. Also, I don't like the best shot feature. I'll edit my pictures if I want to. I don't need these constant annoying suggestions. Please fix this. Thank you."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Almost a five star app, I mostly don't even mind the notifications. Trading on nostalgia is a bit of a low blow for us parents and grandparents, but the fact is, I like looking at ""anniversary "" photos, so usually, I enjoy them in spite of myself. The option to create your own book is amazingly cool, and the results are not half bad. At my age, it's unlikely that I'll ever use a tenth of the alternatives available, but what I have used is easy and the results are very nice."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Always had issue with auto enhace feature, it adds a lot of tint to the photos. (it is funny that the thubnail for the enhancement looks good, but it is not what you get when you apply it). The new update has a weird UI and the placement of controls are not user friendly, and looks toy-ish. Liked the old interface with all the slider controls in one place."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Very good app. Please add more filters and effects for videos and can u add a live video recording feature with effects and filters?
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I took my phone to Metro. It was really messed up & they were no help over the phone. I always knew it could fix it with a factory reset. But as usual they didn't listen. They did a factory reset and all photos & contacts were lost.. I've waited on hold for them the at least 8 hours and got no help at all. Finally took my phone in only to get a factory reset. I backed up my phone to email and sim card but their both cleared. Any ideas. I can't replace my pics. I'll probably get my contacts back

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Fed up. The app is inbuilt in the phone, so I am forced to use it. When trying to make a callage, it doesn't peak photo from screen shot. Edit option is poor. Can't put a photo in another photo. No option to choose which photo to back up and which not. No option to stop back up. Once you have opted to back up your photos it will take each and every photo in to backup. It can't allow folders to shift to external storage. You can't sort photos in group for shifting to SD card."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm constantly frustrated when trying to organize and search for my pictures in folders. It's easier to organize in Drive, but not since Photos doesn't automatically save to Drive. Now I have to manually move photos which is a pain. I should be able to search for a folder by its name, and I should have the option to organize folders alphabetically. I also OFTEN an looking for photos of THINGS, which Photos' Search does NOT do well. I should be able to somehow label photos easily with item names"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,You have duplicated all my pictures which takes up more storage and then you push to get me to buy more storage! You aren't getting a penny out of me! Thievery is what this is!

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This up is so frustrating! I keep removing photos from being backed up but it keeps returning it to back up. Using this app is my biggest regret while using my phone.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Google Photos is an exceptional app that allows users to store, organize and share their photos with ease.

Overall, Google Photos is a must-have app for anyone who loves taking photos."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Photos in albums are put there to organize and reduce clutter, yet duplicates are still there in the main pool which still leaves the main pool cluttered and confusing. Photos in albums shouldn't be displayed in the main pool because you can find them in their respective album. Photos in albums should retain their date and place shot of course."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Everything I found good but it needed to improve a thing which is ""the password of locked folder should not be the screen lock password "" I found only this one odd thing in Google photos THANK YOU"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is fantastic. Love the face recognition part (which is completely optional btw if you don't feel comfortable with such things). Extremely useful when I take a photo of my friends and need to share it with them. I would love for this process to be automatic. Also looking forward to further AI additions, e.g. a ""find similar photos"" feature. Could also do with in-app RAW format editing. Overall an amazing app I've already got two more people to use it"

"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I take a lot of photos and I really make use of the albums. Being able to share them with any other type of phone is very nice. Also, to be able to easily retrieve favorites is helpful. 5 would have been my vote before the update too. I agree with Joe Ramirez on the amount of space I am lacking all of a sudden. Also, Ginger Gillis with trying to delete. I move to the next photo to delete only to find the one I thought deleted is still there. It is quite confusing!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Good app...needs more in the edit wheel house...can't we fix a blurry picture??? Looking at all the AI editing tools I guess I'll have to try one...
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I just lost 4 years of photos because nowhere on this stupid app states that it will connect directly to your separate phone photo gallery and that deleting photos to free space on your Google account will also delete them off of your SEPARATE PHONE PHOTO GALLERY
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Most useful app I have ever used. Period. The ability to get your photos on any device whenever you want is incredible. The editing tools are relatively basic but it is easy to export to Snapseed or Lightroom. I love the simple, easy to navigate interface. I use this as my primary photos app because of how superior it is to any other photo gallery app. The ability to store your photos at original quality is very convenient as a photographer. I also appreciate that it has support for RAW photos."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A very good app! Great to have unlimited storage. Took awhile to set up all the many options, but I am sure to have GREAT photos and videos with the fine tuning already done and out of the way.

I want the ability to download bulk images based on filters so I can edit those images and reupload them. I would LOVE a better video editing function added. I have a ton of video up in Photos but no real way of getting at it and pulling it together in order to make interesting videos to share with family. Thanks team Google"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am using this app on my OnePlus 7t. Every time I want to save any video, a message ""Error saving video"" appears."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Very convenient and easy to use. Missing some of the more fun photo editing capabilities like stickers and needs more filters. Minor issues though considering all the free cloud based storage and decent processing abilities built in. The search is also very powerful as it understands what is in the photo without the need for manual tagging. Wish the collage feature was better. Minus one star for still needing to use other editing apps to do those things.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Its okay, but not necessarily connected to drive but definitely takes up space in gmail."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great place to store photos and a great investment. I would prefer if you could have unlimited photos on there but I can understand why they don't allow it, I love the dates added in, the places feature, it's certainly when your phone crashes and all of your photos are saved and not recked, it has also freed up a ton of space on my phone so thanks Google Photos"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Opens another application when sharing to Google drive. Ludacrous bug team Google photos !
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy the different features you can apply to your photos. I love how they are easy to find by being organized by peoples faces. I want to look a picture up of someone or something and I just click the face or place, and all the pictures that are connected to that comes up. It's very user friendly and keeps things organized."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Finally exploring everything, that Google has to offer, after using Google for the past 10+yrs. It's easy enough to follow and utilize, I appreciate it, keep up the good work."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, however there is a flaw according to me. The reason I didn't give 5 star is because of its editing feature. I use Pixel 7 Pro. When I open a photo from the 'Photos' menu down below, it gives me option of 'Edit', however when I open the same photo from going to the folder I created in my library, the edit option disappears. This is frustrating. I have thousands of photos and it difficult to find a photo from All Photos displayed."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It is never updated, I have to open the app and click on update to kind of purging the updating process and stops if I close the app."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Hate that it's an app now. I lost all of my saved pictures on photos. The editing isn't great anymore.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My photos are unbelievable. That's how wonderfully good they are. Because my photos mean a lot to me. Because I've had 2 deaths recently. In my family and Pho, those help me. They really do end music so thank you so much for helping me"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"unable to edit, check your connection.. Connection is fine. Also, SORT PHOTOS IN ALBUMS FROM NEWEST FIRST!!! This is not logical the last photo at bottom, especially for document archiving photos! No thought to user design, low quality software. Also can't delete a photo on photos app without deleting it locally..it does not sync properly! Garbage of the highest order."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the automatic organization it does and honestly just how smart the app is. It's constantly giving me great stylized photos and organizing all my photos into perfectly crafted folders and albums. By far the best photos app I've used and it doesn't hurt that the camera on the Google Pixel 3 XL is ridicuously good, making the app look even better."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I haven't been able to access my locked folder. It does not appear in my settings. I've updated the app and tried again. What can be done about it?
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Just left a one star review and it vanished?? Even with sync turned off it is still backing up my photos and telling me I don't have enough storage to get email. Then if I delete photos from Google photos it ALSO deletes them from my phone! I almost lost some very very important pictures because I didn't know it was going to take them off of my device. Why on earth would anyone want that? Soo not okay. Do not use this app!
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Just started using Google Photos app, so far I am very happy. Had to factory reset my phone due to not working right, and I didn't have a chance to upload my photos onto laptop. Google Photos was able to put those photos into my cloud so I can put them back on my phone without losing any. I highly recommened Google Photos app to anyone looking for something simple and easy to use. Thank you for creating/providing this useful app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Reinstate Photo Backup In Drive! The loss of having my photos synced to my hard drive is mind-numbingly dumb and incredibly frustrating. If Google hadn't killed Picasa and neutered Drive, they'd still be a good option for quick editing and backing up your photos. Unfortunately, the Photos app lacks many of the organizational and creative features from Picasa (where's my collage?) and sacrifices the ease of synchronization for more cloud only data. USELESS!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I think it's a good idea because sometimes we face the problem of network and where by you have information which you want to keep it as a person. Sometimes you try to calling someone
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I really enjoy Google Photos because it does alot of helpful things and reminds me of special days I'd forgotten which keep me smiling and full of cheer! Very thankful for this app on my phone and devices I have it on. Thanks Google!
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Well organized in terms of online archiving and search options are getting better. Cropping and Color correction tools are simple and effective. Easy to use too. Auto color correction could be better instead of just brightening the image. Need noise reduction tools. Google lens isn't that effective yet but a very cool feature. It would be great to have access to Google photos through other apps like WhatsApp directly to choose photos and share instead of downloading and then sharing.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Why did they get rid of geo tagging and showing photos on a map. Very useful tool that's now gone. Google please bring it back.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,VPN was causing Photos to not realize it's connected to Wi-Fi. ATT seems to have fixed their VPN.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. I never loose pictures since I started using it. Even after using several phones, I still get all my old photos once I log in my email. It's very nice üôÇ"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Excellent for storage of photos and videos. But that being said there is room for improvement on more storage.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Being able to utilize the automatic backup feature has saved some of my most cherished photos and videos from fading away as I get older. Being able to login and download my files to any device that I want too, is definitely a luxury. Whenever I go through my albums of cherished memories, my daughter loves to flip through the photos as well. As for me, I get to add another memory of the two of us reminiscing about her childhood and the moments that she considers to be special to her."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm pretty Amazed by the changes, I was requesting for a feature that lets us Capture pic from the frames and export it and they actually did it. Thanks Google. Edit. Love the movie editing feature, just wish that it could let us decide the quality of the video when saving it. Great video but very low quality when. Being exported, I wish it could let us choose till 4k."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My videos aren't uploading and I don't know why. My other pixel they uploaded just fine and now they aren't. It's getting really aggravating. Please help me
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"OK but not the best of apps for pictures. It's saves downloaded images but do not always show up in the downloaded folder also if I create a folder in another app it doesn't always pick it up and show what I've done straight away, sometimes it might not be until you have turned off your device and turned it back on again the new folder appears or if it's asking to upgrade sometimes it won't show anything you have done until you update. Needs sorting."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am a long-time user of this app. Because I always have many games, apps, etc. my actual devices tend to stay low on storage. I genuinely need something like what Google Photos always has been. But, of course, Google has to once again go out of their way to ruin their own products. They already have more money than half the world, but suddenly they HAVE to get rid of free unlimited photo storage or they ""won't be able to provide Google Photos""? Somehow, I find that hard to believe."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love that I don't have to worry about losing my photos. People are often complimenting the photo quality. It's great that the app often suggests better versions of my original photo. I like that I can organize my photos into folders and then reference those folders to show in my Google hub as a slideshow. I wish there was an easy way to add them to Google Drive in a folder structure rather than keeping them on my phone (Pixel 4a).
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Old version is better,,,,I have many photos in hide options,,,but no one option in the new version Hide Photos,,,my all photos are Deleted üò°üò°üò°üò°"

"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used this app for many years with no problems, until recently. I keep getting an error message when opening the app which tells me to uninstall and reinstall, which I did. There's been no improvement with the error message still showing and in the process of uninstalling and reinstalling I've lost some important photos in my locked folder."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Photos get deleted when backing up sometimes. Some photos become grayed out and non-accessible. Also, a major thing is that when pressing save to device, it hardly ever downloads the photo from the cloud. When I disconnect from wifi to cellular, once in a while it works, but that's like playing lottery. All the sudden minutes or like 10 minutes later all the photos start downloading. I pay for this service and it's garbage."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This new app update is terrible! I cannot transfer photos from my Android phone to my PC. Please give me a link to an older version ASAP!!
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Should be something to simplify our digital life but it takes very long to upload my phone pictures and it seems that the feature to create an album is completely not working as it takes long to reply our commands, it doesn't show any progression bar of any sort and after a few minutes, nothing happens. I have tried redownloading it, updating, signing in and out, but these problems still persists."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Stopped syncing two weeks ago and even after reinstalling, deleting on device pictures, clearing cache, and double checking sync options, none of my photos that I've uploaded over the last 8 years appears in the app. On my browser I can see my old photos and upload new ones, but otherwise this app has been completely broken for me out of the blue with no support for fixing it. I filed a community question last week and there still has been no support."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It's very good app but I don't know why I can't recover my old pictures or anything from the same gmail which is my Gmail bcs I always keep my photos and videos in that but I don't recover them why.and those photos aren't the one I deleted it's just when losing and find onother new one it's impossible to recover my old photos
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"For me, can i say some or many of my picture in this google photo is blur and black, did'nt show any at all can i say is my device or this app but i can believe maybe is my phone i think is the app, please fine something to do with app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new update is aweful.... the last version was more enjoyable and easy to use .. I loved the auto edits it did on my photos in the app.. It was always a surprise to see what google photos did to my photos at the end of the day after taking pictures.. now the app is so complicated for what it is .. I look at it trying to go to location of its created auto edits as I always did , and now I just back out of the app because its so confusing.."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love how I can access all of my photos anywhere and how easy it is to sort. I do wish it had a better photo editing app with it, but That's definitely not a deal breaker. I really appreciate how it will recognize faces which also helps you sort photos and label them. My favorite part is that it automatically makes slideshows or enhances photos at random and sends them to me. I had several photos of my fiance and his son doing martial arts together and it turned it into a a flip book type clip"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Came back from vacation and till now, Photos have been backing up pictures from my phone at 1 photo every 20 minutes or so... and I have 2200 photos left to back up."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love this app. I use it to keep both my laptop and phone organized. One small non important issue I've been having across multiple cell devices is each time I scroll up while it's backing up my photos to watch the progress it crashes. Only other thing I wish the app would perform more automated creations without having to take dozens of photos before it creates a single one. Not big issues but the fact that they exist is the only current to time of review reason I mark this app as 4 stars.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It is difficult to use,and can take me up to an hour to ""find"" a particular photo,which is immensely frustrating-sometimes it seems to ""move"" photos to a different location, for no apparent reason. In spite of, now, numerous, "" improvements"" each to be applaued,and welcomed, the FUNDAMENTAL problem remains. For example it took me FOUR HOURS yesterday afternoon, to find a set of two pictures adjacent to each other. Why can't the "" SEARCH"" facility be refined, so that an image is findable?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Once a very good way of backing up photos from my computer, it failed catastrophically when i replaced the pc with a new one which had the same collection of photos on it. Instead of recognising that the photos were identical to those already uploaded, it actually changed the time stamps of all of them and upload them again, together with various other discarded versions, creating complete havoc! The situation is clearly irretrievable so i won't be using it any more."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Brilliant app for storing my photos on reasonable resolution for free. All my photos are uploading to Google Photos automatically when I'm connected to WiFi. It's very convenient, easy to navigate, use the search bar for searching by categories and using the side bar for chronological order of my pictures. All features well picked and fitted for enhanced user experience. I like it."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A useful, and well organized application, with great potential for the active photographer, amateur, or professional. With a small amount of effort required on the part of the user, Google Photos helps keep images you acquire safe, secure, and readily accessible. What more could one ask of a well trained, proactive photographer's assistant?"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,My storage is full because it backs up SCREENSHOTS. I can't stop screenshots from being backed up!!! Seriously I've tried.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,From storage perspective this app is good but it uploads all photos from devise rather each album and not syncing back if you change your device so technically you lost all the folder. Samsung cloud is very good it's backup all folder and sync back as they were on the old phone. If we just have to upload photos we can do that cheaper way through OneDrive. Not recommended
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,No one should install this app. All your photos will be backed up and your Google storage will full. Than they will ask you to purchase storage from Google at Rs 130 per month.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,You need to have a different password option for locked folder in photos. Its shouldn't be same as lock screen password. 5 stars then.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Constantly suggesting that I delete pictures and hiding things in automatic ""albums"" no editing tools, won't allow to delete across all platforms, if you do delete camera pics (vs a screenshot or a download) it will be back next week. No editing tools, filters suck, no stickers...I could go on but there are better photo apps out there as we all know. No free prints, no printing option at all unless you get another app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Frustrating to use. When I move photos to an album it changes the 'date modified' exif data so my photos are all out of date order now. Also if I copy an image to a new folder, then delete the copy, the original is deleted too. When I restore and move back to original folder, the photos 'date created' is set to current date, again causing images to be out of date order. Very frustrating, I think this app only exists as a means to get people to upgrade to the paid cloud storage."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Can't I just look at my pictures and have them follow me when I get another phone or wherever my email pops. I mean there's some pretty important photos in their of my family and stuff and I don't know how many have lost because they just didn't come with me when I changed phones or lost the phone and had to get a new one it's really heartbreaking
"January 5, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app works seamlessly with my Pixel 3 to automatically back up all of my photos. They are easily accessed across platforms. We are also able to share photos with family members and friends (some of whom have iPhones) without issues. Photos are easily searched and can be sorted in a variety of helpful ways (by person, location, date, etc.). Excellent app."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It takes up to much stuff if there are to many photos causing my Gmail to not get any emails. It keeps saying storage is full
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Works okay, but it's turned into nagware! Took away my option to backup only photos (force me to backup videos to eat up more drive space). Now forcing me to upload only high quality photos to eat up more drive space. Now I get 10-15 notifications a day about running out of drive space. Take a hike!"
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I hate the fact that there is an expiration on photo link sharing. This is ridiculous and does not make sense whatsoever. Additionally, I think it's absolutely ridiculous to put limits on the amount of pictures when making collages. I hate the whole system the way you have it set up. Google, you are getting way out of control. After several app updates the linkshsring does not work. It just continues at like its processing the creation of link sharing and it never creates a photo link sharing ."

Besides data collection and spamming to buy more storage, is there any other logical argument? Google Photos App on Chrome: Useless. Uploaded content not accessible. Pictures and videos do not load. You can't delete albums because the 3 dots button does not appear. I am deleting everything one by one. Bonus: Can't download them either. A big F U for this exp."

"January 5, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Functionality is not as expected. For instance all photos and videos enter the system in chronological order. When you move it into an album you expect it to really move into an album and not stay in the camera chronological order, worst yet if you delete it from the camera it disappears from the album. In my mind the album is to give the pictures or videos a proper place to retrieve than later and to store them and not the camera to act as the controlling archive."
"January 5, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Every update is hell. EVERY. UPDATE. Nothing changes. The advice never works. I give up.Regular updates seem to make things worse .The issue I have never gets fixed in these updates. I have a Google pixel and it's crazy because you'd think a Google phone would be super compatible and work smoothly with a Google app but this is the only phone I've ever had that has this much trouble with Google photos.
"January 5, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The hackers got into my account and I had to create new accounts. I want my old ones back. I can't access pictures. None of my passwords work.

"January 5, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"MOSTLY good but they need an efficient duplicate removal process. Google photos can automatically upload your camera roll and then give you the option to delete the ones that have been backed up. You can search your photo library by time, location, people's faces (creepy but useful) and redownload as necessary. The only drawback is they don't have any way to remove duplicate photos, so that means your space is going to fill up real quick if you're not actively deleting duplicates as you go."
