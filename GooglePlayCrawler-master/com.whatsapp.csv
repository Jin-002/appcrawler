So we just speak and it will convert to text. As its used frequently by many users, this feature will definitely save our hassle and the time to type. Also, when forwarding more than one message, it would also enhance user experience and save the hassle if it can be forwarded in order. And thanks for the decent job so far!"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Ok. This is probably the best messenger app and has many features other apps don't have. However, here are some bugs preventing it from being 5⭐️ 1. Sometimes when opening the app it says backing up data, it reaches 100 percent but just hangs there, u can't click anything else 2. Sometimes u can't scroll down to see your stickers it will constantly move you back up 3. Sending multiple files at once will cause them to be jumbled out of order"

I can only send 1 sticker at a time, taking me lots of time as it will go back to the top after each click, making it not user-friendly.. Hope there is no limitation for stickers sharing so that I can continue to send multiple stickers at one go to substitute my texts, making them creative & enjoyable for all to read them.. Thank u!"

However the recent update where the calls, status (now updates) , calls etc. have been moved to the bottom is a real inconvenience. I don't see the necessity for such a change. It's causing too much of confusion and the current layout is uncomfortable. If there's no particular use to it , then I would prefer it to go back to where it was."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The navigation bar's previous placement at the top was not only familiar but also practical. Now the experience feels disrupted and clumsy. The navigation bar at the bottom appears out of place and disrupts the overall visual harmony of the app. Please prioritize functionality and user experience over unnecessary design changes that seem to be made for the sake of change rather than improvement.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The recent update in which the interface is changed, placing the navigation bar at the bottom, is the update wanted by none.

The previous interface was good and we all are habituated with that one. Now it is not that familiar like before. I love to use that interface - Navigations were at the top. Not the present one - Navigations at the bottom. You just add features more and more. We are really pleased with them. But please don't change the interface. I just want that interface back with a new update. Please
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It is one of the most popular, but the worst app possible. There are a lot of annoying things here, but the most annoying is that you can't use it on multiple devices simultaneously.

The new look with the icons on the bottom of the screen instead of the top makes it look not as professional looking, clean, or sharp.

Its an application where you can communicate with friends and family all over the world, not checking how many people have viewed your stories."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The new UI is good on the surface, but for people with taller phones, it makes it difficult to reach the chats on the top and i have to move my entire hand to do so.

Please give us an option to revert the UI, or give us the option to make chats be pinned at the bottom of the screen instead of the top."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"WhatsApp has been good so far. But there is one feature we would like to request, which is the ability to select multiple items (messages, photos, stickers, etc) by long-tapping on one to select, and then sliding up or down on the others to select them.

"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"While WhatsApp has had some glitches. it almost always works perfectly. Just got the new UI update and don't like it yet, the main suggestions I'd make are letting the user modify the bottom button layout, and allowing you to hide the bottom bar entirely until it's needed but if the layout is chosen by us then we would be able to just swipe while knowing already. this would make it cleaner and more similar to the iPhone app as their bottom bar takes up less screen real-estate"

I just think posting on Instagram is getting more better than Whatsapp 🥺"

Thankfully, the chat features are somewhat the same."

You are honestly horrible people. All that's needed is a toggle button."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Looks like a recent update moved my status bar to the bottom of th screen. As per WhatsApp this is an intended functionality. Intended functionality is an easy way to escape. This is forcing the user to follow a path despite knowing it is confusing as you have mentioned. Because of this the display settings have gone hay wire and gives me only a limited portion of the screen to be used when compared to the previous version. Time for me to start thinking of an alternative. Useless UI.

"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,WhatsApp functionality is as always great. But I am not a fan of change in UI. The new layout (tab menu in white at bottom) made it look bad for light theme. WhatsApp's trademark GREEN colour almost vanished and the new layout reminds me of plain old Microsoft word doc.

It says ""Can't send. Chose a different video."" I have tried it with all videos but I'm unable to. My friends, family they all can send it without any difficulty but I don't know why this is happening with me. Kindly check it out"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The last update is terrible for me because it has moved the upside vertical layout button structure to the bottom of the screen, and unfortunately it doesn't let us choose what we like most. So why!! Why you don't let the users free to make their own preference? I want it back, and as I have seen there are numerous of people who suffer from the same thing."

However, with the latest update, encountered a significant issue. I'm unable to view status updates, which has hindered my ability to engage with my contacts in the same way I used to. Additionally, I'm not a fan of the recent changes in the latest version. The interface feels less intuitive, and some features have been moved around, causing some confusion."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You're turning Whatsapp into garbage. What is this last update. The status bar was better on top, and the overview in status section just terrible terrible. Just keep it simple and as it as. You're just doing things on your own and aren't even listening to your customers if what they want? Absolutely dumb. Like come on, listen to the people who use it. Do you even research before adding random features and making unnecessary changes? Dumb moves."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This new layout where i have to click to go to statuses isn't good. The swipe to statuses and other menus like calls and communities was better. This isn't user friendly. It feels like we're going back in time making it harder to use the app that forward to make it easier to use. Please return the previous layout, it's user friendly and less hectic."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Please could you stop with the numerous reorganization of the interface with each update.....it's getting annoying....there's no need to move the ribbon at the top to the bottom as it was minutes ago before I opened the pp and the interface has changed. Please it's mentally distressing trying to readjust the mind the do something you've always done because someone decode to switch it's position.

Tik symbol, (even if my internet speed is good)"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"EDIT: Normally when I want to view an image in full screen on status, I usually long press and hold, then all the WhatsApp elements, and image caption will fade out, but now everything else clears except for the caption and it's sometimes annoying as it obstructs a part of the image, it's mostly annoying with images containing long texts. Pls do fix this. Other than that the app is awesome 💯"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Our side of the mic doesn't work when the screen is locked (other side person can't hear us out while we can clearly hear them). For them to listen to us, we should avoid the app from getting locked, which isn't possible unless you keep on tapping the screen to avoid locking. This used to be a very annoying long-term issue until An droid 13. It was OK until the recent Feb security patch level update. Now, the same problem has made a comeback in even worse Avatar. What'sApp has to resolve this."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If I could give a zero star I would, the new update is trash. We love WhatsApp for it's simple design and less addictive nature. Students like me mainly use it for studies. it is becoming like a social media, please we just want a simple chatting app just enough to communicate without lags. and I might move to other apps if anymore annoying update comes. We are requesting you to not change the design and add more functions like intagram, instead just make already available functions better"

The user experience is certainly adowngrade, if 1 had an option to roll back to theprevious version, I would. The app already had an easy""swipe"" to navigate between Chats, Status and Calls.Why change that? Now, T have to move my finger tothe bottom of my screen to tap the buttons just tonavigate these tabs. It just feels annoying, especialyon a phone with large screen size. Please bring the Swipe back."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"there is no green that's green enough to express my disgust with the WhatsApp update - STOP it with the unannounced and non-intuitive updates; the user interface doesn't need to change every two weeks. the current one (March 20th 2024) is the worst so far - please bring them back to the top of the screen, it didn't bother ANYbody when it was up there instead of at the bottom. bringing the different ""pages"" down to the bottom is just too much of a ""pick me! I'm social media too! 🥺"" move - stop."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's very irritating when someone posts a high quality picture or video on your status and whatsapp drops it so low that you can barely recognize your post. Please kindly improve this or let us have the option to post in HD!!! And please let's go back to other interface that let's us slide through the tabs. This new bottom tab thingy isn't an improvement.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Its a great app over all, but there are still some bugs and one that bothers me most is the security Whatsapp gives you the option of putting either a pin or fingerprint or both if you want But the problem is that the pin only shows up ocationally and not everytime you open the app, the fingerprint comes up everytime, but sometimes it just does'nt scan your finger and keeps you locked out of the app The only way to get in is to restart your phone and try again, wich gets very anoying"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Overall great application. But I don't think it's fair that people using the other versions of the application have way better experience than people who are using the actual app, such as the ability to translate a message, flight mode, and ghost mode, talkless of their ability to change the theme, and even have a local chat backup. Please look into these"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,whatsapp has always been a great app but recently I have two issues. my media doesn't display on my gallery even after using android 11 migration so if I want to see any media I need to go to my files. secondly the new sticker tray is full of bugs. the pop-up is slow and when using it there are lots of faults. please fix this or make an option to keep the classic sticker tray instead of the new one
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"All new interface after update is very absurd,I know very well that the characteristic of the What'sApp menu display is very attractive, unique, and iconic, but in this update many functions are missing or only my cellphone is like this, for example: the edit chat feature, now it's not there on my device. I LIKE OLD VERSION OF WHAT'S APP"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"My experience has been great overall, the interface is nice and intuitive. But I have one issue; I have so many groups and contacts that it's easy for me to miss important chats among the clutter of messages, can you guys bring a feature that will allow people organize their chats into customizable folders? I very sure a lot of people will love that feature!"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App is garbage, simple thing as to change number, you won't be able to get verification code, either through call or SMS, even when everything is intact. It keeps failing and telling you to try again in 1 hour. It's such a disdain, an app with such stature will have this kind of big issue and is left as normal, without it being addressed!!!!!"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The channels feature is kinda fine but making an extra tab for it instead of putting it with the updates would make it much nicer and less cluttered Edit : the community tab was separated byt now there are more glitches, like when I go to select a sticker and scroll down the stickers automactically move back up to the top and a lot of sticker packs are missing and the tick symbol takes a lot longer to appear even with good internet speed"

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The worst thing is that after many years of using WhatsApp, I lost my data. I spent more than 24 hours restoring media whatsapp from the Google Drive, and in the end, no chat history has been no media. I want to know how I am restoring my data and files it's the worst thing. Give more options to back up the data to many other ways, or keep on the backup on the server itself."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I basically think WhatsApp is a perfect messaging service, but the calls leave a lot to be desired. Almost every call I make on WhatsApp has a noticeable delay, which leads to people talking over each other. Very frustrating. There are also major concerns for me over how my data is stored and shared with third parties, so I am considering switching to Signal. Hopefully the calls on that are smoother."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"UI/UX The app has a non-intuitive and old interface. The Community tab in the top-left part of the UI is small and hard to reach. Finally, viewing who viewed a message is also non-intuitive (swiping from the right of the message would be better). FEATURES Inability to share large files of any kind (mp4 , pdf...). Inability to clear individual private and group chats. Media quality. BUGS The profile picture failed to load; Default message timer had to be set manually for all contacts;"

Getting spam calls and messages, I have never gotten those on this platform before the 'local networking statuses' were added. Over all, been increasingly feeling frustrated and brotherd on the platform I mainly use to stay in contact with family. Just please stop with the unnecessary changes and revert back to the WhatsApp roots before I convert my friends and family to Telegram or something."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The functionalities of this app is good. But the one and only drawback is that when we touch the dp it will redirect us to view the status of that particular person. If that person's status is already muted by me because of the irritation or etc, that feature is redirect me to that status. Omitting this feature in your future update would be better. And also the current update is so annoying 😔 It is not user friendly and the UI is look life too noisy. Don't add more things to UI it's irritating"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Bruh! Don't know why the feature of admin being to delete messages was added, so much for free speech eh? Don't have any issues but that. Please, let it go. Yall changed the design to look like that of an apple device, we didn't ask for that, the execution is bad. If it's possible, return back to the default interface"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new UI update has completely ruined my experience with this app. In the past year they have just kept rolling out annoying updates like this that nobody asked for and is just an inconvenience that makes the whole app look so much worse. If there was any way to switch back to the old UI, I would take it immediately."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Great app for staying connected with friends and family. Easy to use interface and reliable messaging service with previous versions.

Thank You"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I must convey my disappointment with the latest update. The changes implemented are not only unattractive but also uncomfortable to the eyes.The design alterations seem to lack finesse and refinement, giving the impression of a novice application rather than a seasoned one. It feels like a regression rather than an improvement, resembling a first version rather than a mature product.the recent update has compromised these qualities, making the application less enjoyable to use."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"All things considered, WhatsApp is useful to us in our day-to-day activities and has become ingrained in our culture of keeping and sharing secrets. However, I have always noticed that when I post a status update or a video on WhatsApp, the contact person does not see the exact clear image and instead sees a blurry version of the image. You can improve the status bar so that it displays the same real-size image on status."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The recent update on WhatsApp where the chats, updates and call logs have been moved to the bottom of the screen is not helping and the removal of the swipe feature makes it less user friendly. It was so much better before. This new update or feature is not convenient to use and has hampered the smooth functioning of the app. Kindly take this update back!"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I didn't recieve any phone call notification since 2 last updates. It was ringing but i couldn't answer the call until i open the app and it's so annoying. I don't have any problem with notification and background data settings, all is fine and It's proven on another messenger apps. So please fix this annoying bug or whatever you call it. And the latest update is lame. How dare you to move the navigation buttons to the bottom? Don't you have any better updates but to move the buttons?"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a nice app, I suggest if there can be a toggle on and off button if you want channels on the updates section, cause it's has to be the choice of the user if he wants to even see suggestions of channels or just totally get channels off on his/her WhatsApp then when he wants he can just turn it back on. Please kindly look it to it if it makes sense."

I am also able to send photos ans short videos and recieve. I am also able to send files and recieve as well. you can voice message. the one thing I'm not crazy aboit is when I delete something, it leaves a ghost print leaving a print that something was there, which leads to the question; what did you delete? that is all I know about this qpp thus far."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"As compare to all other Social Media Apps, I suppose WhatsApp to be more safe, reliable and easy to use. But the issue of banning WhatsApp account has fed me up. My account was banned for 6,7 times that makes my business shut down. It would be good if you people remove this feature. And also kindly keep bar upper. At the bottom area, messages, updates etc don't look good. It's creating difficulty. Also have separate bar for chats and groups. Thank You"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This has been a great app, best messaging app by a distance. The recent changes are great. But it can be improved upon. With people belonging to several chat groups these days, groups chats need to be separated from individuals', and their should be option to change the default display menu colours and outlook. In short more customization option should be integrated."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Really disappointed by new update with navigation bar at bottom. Problem is that I'm now used to of earlier version (coz I've been using it for years ) and this sudden new update cause more efforts and time as it is in bottom with no sliding options which drives me crazy most of the time. Support team pls look into this issue for better user experience. Thankyou
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The latest update of this app has left me feeling disappointed. The new version has a cheap and unprofessional appearance, and it has lost some of the features that made it valuable. The user interface has become cluttered, making it frustrating to use. If the developers want to retain loyal users like me, they should consider reverting to the previous version or making significant improvements to the current one."""
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the new update, it makes the entire UI look nicer and more appealing. My only drawback is the fact that we can't slide from one section to the other as we always could. That was a feature I heavily relied on while using WhatsApp and now it's not there any longer. Also, the color could have a change too, the dark mode seem like it's more of green than actual dark. Besides all these, the new update is really appealing and I'd like I could do the things I could do on the old on this too."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Disappointed by the new update. Navigation bar is on bottom with removal of swiping left right feature. Just missing the old version. The most awaited feature is the addition of separate groups and chats feature. Plz plz add this feature because the chats and groups mess up under the same feature chats. Plz look into this also. The reason for three stars is new and annoying update although I used to love the app for communication.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is very good and useful.. It has many new features that help us to have a safe and private conversation. But peronally from few days i am continuously facing many problems on the app firstly, about the quality of the vdios goes worst if we send it to someone thought the new feature of hd is good but it is not available for all vdios and photos. The next problem is about the status which we upload after uploading a vdio the quality goes worst.These problems should be seen once to improve."

The moment I attempt to scroll down, even if I'm scrolling as slow as possible, the screen jumps back up to the top of my saved stickers. It's as if there's a glitch preventing me from scrolling any further. Also, the app is constantly crashing. I'd be typing, and mid texting, my screen would freeze, and the app would have to be closed and reopened in order to work again but it doesn't even work for long before it crashes again."

If i want to share multiple photos at the same time, say i want to mail them. It is not very convenient. In the iphone, you just select all and then press share. But as soon as you selsect more than one, the option of share dissappears. If whatsapp can add this feature in the next update, it would be so convenient. Other than that the app is just very good.

The message features are almost perfect because, for example, when your comment is replied some times or during a short time, the editing disappears, so it should be improved a little. Finally, it lacks a better uploading support, telegram support until 2 GB files upload, and telegram has 1B+ users, that's why there's no reason to not add it, I needed it for videos for a long time."

Just useful for when I'm speaking to someone in person during a call, and all they can hear is the background noise from the video call, even on the lowest volume. Also, why is there now a random useless feature that opens up participants on the call when i hold for half a second? I get a small piece of dirt on my screen and try to wipe it off, and then it's been minimised showing a single name. It's annoying. Remove it."

Especially when we're so used to it now, it's really inconvenient. Putting the titles at the bottom wasn't bad, just please take back the swiping.

This feature has been helpful in saving time and avoiding confusion about the availability of person I am trying to call. However, with the newly introduced update, even when the person's internet is off, it still displays 'ringing,' which is misleading. This app should be a kind of relief and not one that stimulates tension."

It is taking all my self-discipline to not get disrespectful and unleash a slew of profanity."

Now a huge bar is added at the bottom of the screen including the 2 mentioned, while I use only the other 2 functions which is ""chats"" and ""calls"". Which means that, with that ridiculous space occupied with no aesthetic at all, half of the ridiculous space consists of function that I'll never touch. Please focus on your own function which is message and call."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I think this is one of the best messaging apps there is. There are so many features that other messaging apps just don't have. I have seen this in other reviews and do agree, with the fact that there isn't an option to come off speaker in video calls. There is also the fact that you can no longer swipe between messages and calls and updates, which is a bummer 😔. It also does drain the battery, but I am generally very pleased with this app and would certainly recommend it."

If anything, I think us Androiders would like the opportunity to peep in the chat without actually opening the chat other than that, I do like to swipe to get to the different areas of the app, specifically to statuses. Update: 03/13/24 So you guys had set it back to it's original state, I said thanks, just not publicly. However, it's changed again. Put it back, Please🙏"

I have tried customer support and all their suggestions do not work and there isn't even a number available to call. Account deletion doesn't even work If I could give it zero stars I would because it just did this out of nowhere after years of using this app

Add options to separate the groups and community tabs for chats as in the GB WhatsApp, also add ""Goto first message"" option in chats and ""Message a number"" option in home page's 3 dot menu. Also add option to transfer media from the other mobile. I transferred the data to new mobile but I didn't get the media that I had in my previous phone."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's functioning flawlessly and meeting expectations. However, I'd like to address the chat lock feature. Its primary aim is to provide the ability to secure chats when your phone is accessible to others. The concern arises when a chat is considered locked even though it can be opened using a pattern. I believe a true chat lock feature should only be unlockable with a fingerprint. So if I lock a chat with my fingerprint, someone with access to my phone would be unable to view the locked chats."

This helps in explaining/ teach someone on a call or have fun showing ideas from my screen. I however would like this to improve with adding features like ""annotation"" which would help to be highlight markers or pointers while sharing my screen. This would help teaching elder people what to touch on the phone if I was for example giving a tutorial."

The old version was perfect, no need to change it. Btw there should be an option to shut off these annoying channels"

Should the status have a long text below it, it's a hassle to click the *readmore* the text input keeps getting in the way. I believe the initial swipe up for a reply on status is better. If you feel it isn't intuitive enough, perhaps a kind of ""swipe up gesture"" or animation could be shown monetarily afterwards it carefully disappears. This can easily signal how to reply to a status should it be needed why not getting in the way of the UX"

The polls are useful and the new AI features are good albeit somewhat limited, but overall the app is reliable and popular, so it does the job. EDIT after upgrading to pixel 8 pro: pretty much the same experience, but for some reason locked chats require 2 scans to access rather than the one used to open the chat drawer on my old phone."

I can no longer simply swipe to navigate unto to my status' and calls but instead have to go to the bottom of the screen to select what section i want to be in.

While the new layout offers smoother navigation and updated features, the charm of the previous interface is somewhat lost.

"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love WhatsApp and it's new features but I wish there could be a way to make the channels smaller and have the status the vertical way it was before following a channel.

However, one aspect that slightly dampens my experience is the inability for group admins to disable voice chats. While I appreciate the concept of voice chats in groups, it can become overwhelming when multiple conversations are happening simultaneously. The absence of an option for admins to manage or disable this feature in groups feels like a missed opportunity for customisation and control."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Features such as unfavouriting a sticker by clicking it when moved should be informed to the user. It is a waste of time looking around blindly to see where the feature you wish to use is.

A long time ago when I first got it, I used to get messages from random people in other countries so I deleted it. I needed it for work about a year or 2 ago and since I redownloaded I haven't had an issue with random messages. Suggestion: give each message in group chats the option to be a thread like slack.

Perhaps, it is because I'm from a region where WhatsApp is used for texting primarily and seeing life updates on the statuses of people one actually knows and have met, that the instant reactions which are similar to instagram are quite inconvenient.

About 3 updates ago they managed to break a perfectly good app. The ability to send video stopped working with an unable to send video error message. To compound this none of my messages to tech support have born any fruit and have to explain the fault every single time. Months later it still doesn't work. I now absolutely dread these mandatory updates. Update. The non sending video eventually got fixed took a long time though.

The only thing i want from WhatsApp is to create a group icon different from the other chat. It's hard to access a particular group in short time as it is mixed up with other chats. This app totally fails the need of the users. Status in seconds is too less too, i would recommend atleast 1.5 minutes to upload. Sorry for the harsh words but I do believe it would be fixed in future."

I wrote to WhatsApp in detail many time about the issue with screen shots attached but first they replied in a standard format and then there was no reply at all.

It's EMBARRASSING how unreliable ""backup"" is, and how utterly awful the handover is when switching sims between phones. Shameful that people continue to use this."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Would be so much higher of a rating if it didn't use non-standard markdown to format its messages, with inconsistent support across platforms? I can't understand the desicion to almost use markdown, but randomly change a few things, like sure it might not need table support, but why change the syntax used just a little? I also really dislike that images MUST be downloaded. There's a preview of the image in the app, so clearly the data has already been sent in some capacity?"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a great communication app with one highly annoying feature. The search function SUCKS. Yeah, big time. If you search for a contact, let's say John, you might have several contacts named John, or John himself may have more than one WhatsApp account. The problem is if you go one step backward immediately after entering a search, you don't see a search history! So to search for the same term again (whether it's a name or any other term) then YOU HAVE TO WRITE THE TERM AGAIN... AND AGAIN..."

I deeply dislike the way they changed around the interface recently, especially as I've been using it for years and now I have to look somewhere else for everything. I also deeply dislike channels. I don't even want the option to have that on my WhatsApp. It's not what I want WhatsApp to be about! I just want general socialization. I DO NOT WANT EVERY KIND OF SOCIAL MEDIA AT MY FINGERTIPS!!!"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Hey there, I just wanted to share my experience with the S23 Ultra. While it's a powerful device with great camera capabilities, I've been really disappointed with the quality of media when I post it. Whether it's pictures or videos, the quality seems to take a nosedive, making me look bad compared to my iPhone-using friends. It's not just a slight compression issue; it's significantly reducing the picture quality. Even iPhone 8s users seem to be getting better results. Hoping for improvement."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"An otherwise superb app has begun crashing since the past couple of days. When I write about the problem to the developer's email id mentioned here, I get AI formulated responses that indicate the problem isn't even being underdtood correctly in the first place! I even get an error message stating that the app has a bug, which I even shared while communicating with the mentioned email id. But, to no avail and the problem persists!"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A good app that has been adding new features year by year. It's getting closer to its competitors, better in some aspects (security and number of users for example). I'd like the following features to be implemented, ordered by importance: sharing media with the original quality, scheduling messages, voice chat with groups of two people or more. Then five stars will be granted!"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Giving us no control over the new voice chat feature is the most frustrating way I've ever experienced something being rolled out. It appears at random in different chats and there is no way for admins to disable. Many people are using it by accident and even muting the chat doesn't stop the notifications from coming through! PATHETIC WORK META.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Used to be great, now it's horrible. I send a lot of photos through WhatsApp and now it's a nightmare.... Made the app useless for me now... Update: the above issue has been resolved, now the new issue is that I cannot listen to voice messages through Bluetooth. I use WhatsApp at work with headphones in. Now I have to turn off Bluetooth anytime I want to listen to a voice message."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Disappointed with the Latest WhatsApp Update I've been a loyal WhatsApp user for years, but the latest update has left me extremely disappointed. The new layout is cumbersome and counterintuitive. The option to switch between chats and statuses by swiping right or left has been removed, which was a feature I used daily. Now, everything is crammed into the bottom area, which feels cluttered and awkward to navigate. WhatsApp, stop trying to mimic other apps and bring the old interface back."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, most recently, whatsapp has been a haven for bugs as it seems no one over there is in charge of quality control. When I post a video status, it doesn't play from my end, and my contacts can't view it either. The button reply for statuses is quite unnecessary, replying a status is an intentional action, and the swiping up to reply gesture was just fine for that. Now, I can't even read the caption on a contact's status without accidentally sending a reply."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is a very good app, there is no doubt about it, I just want that whenever you update it, add the feature of music to it as soon as possible, so that WhatsApp can become more call and interesting, my suggestion is that the story we put in WhatsApp status is also music in it. There should be an ad, it will be a lot of get up for it..... TRY IT IF ITS POSSIBLE I KNOW NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE IN 2K24 😅. LOVE FROM 🇮🇳 NO OTHER APPS CAN REPLACE WHATSAPP . FOR ME ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Worst product in the market. Captures tons of your personal data, fully buggy, loses your backups and doesn't let you restore them. The worst messaging app available in the market. The only reason why I still using this app is because almost everyone in my country does, so I am obligated. But if it was for me, I would certainly have deleted it already."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Our side of the mic doesn't work when the screen is locked (other side person can't hear us out while we can clearly hear them). For them to listen to us, we should avoid the app from getting locked, which isn't possible unless you keep on tapping the screen to avoid locking. This used to be a very annoying long-term issue until Adroid 13. It was OK until the recent Feb security patch level update. Now, the same problem has made a comeback in even worse Avatar. What'sApp has to resolve this."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The older option of getting to see muted status only after clicking on three dots was much better. What's the use of muting them, if they appear on the same screen. And channels in a messaging app without any option of hiding them from the status screen! The option to search channels is enough for those who don't want to see them everytime. Also introduce option like removing contacts on WhatsApp manually without deleting them from our phonebook, with an option to sync contacts or not."

I think the development team should bring back the more user-friendly version back. Shame on Meta
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"WhatsApp has been good and will continue to be the best messaging app. However if you could make an update such that groups chats are separated from individual chats, it will serve users well. It feels so boring if one has to scroll for so long before detecting a private chat. Most of the time, you don't see until the sender blames you. Thank for this great app and looking forward to greater services."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The new feature in android the navigation bar ( status chat community) has moved to the bottom I don't line this feature. 2nd you cannot take screenshot of the profile pictures of friends. It is not right if someone is showing you your picture there is no need for privacy. They already have the privacy option to whom they can show their profile picture. For these 2 reason I have reduced WhatsApp from 5 stars to 2 stars. Overall app is fine. I would encourage them to revert those features.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't want to give any stars but 1 it is, here is what bothering me from years- When i am already on a whatsapp call and then connect any Bluetooth earphones, there is no check immediately, i have to mute myself and then unmute again. Then there is a new Bluetooth button appears tapping on which switches the call to Bluetooth earphones. I hope you understood the issue if not please take it through the developer or for better understanding to QA. It should switch automatically."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The app has outdated functionalities which do not offer an exciting experience as compared to the 'unofficial' GB apps. It doesn't offer privacy at all. For example when i want to view status without being seen by the sender. I also can't download profile pictures/status as in GB apps. I can't hide messages. With WhatsApp there's no option for colours. It is just a boring essentiality

The chats, updates and calls logs are moved to the bottom which is very problematic. The previous one was much better. Hope it can be changed again. Then it will be more user friendly. And I think so many of us(WhatsApp users) want the previous structure."

(Android version 2.24.2.76) And, the app is still missing simple customization features. Please offer user selectable color alternatives to replace the dreaded green shades of the header and chat bubble colors."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It gets the job done, sure and if you're here it's probably because you need it but honestly, with every passing update they keep adding unnecessary and horrible changes to the app that make it feel less natural, such as the communities, channels and most recently their layout change, which only regresses the flow of their app."

Still a major bug."

My phone is set to dark mode, but I prefer WhatsApp in light mode. This glitches out often, every time I use the app, where random text bubbles in chat, the typing bar, and settings pages will just randomly switch to dark mode. This is particularly annoying, as the text and background will often end up being the same colour, making it difficult to read."

People don't naturally look down at the bottom of their phones. Our hands are ready to type in Whatsapp, so our eyes focus on the middle to the top part of the phone instead. There's a lot of old people on this app that couldn't adapt to new updates at such a fast pace. The reason people use this app is because of its simplicity, and I hope Whatsapp understand that."

I haven't experienced any issues with the app in the past. They said they would review my account and it may take up to 24 hours but as a student most of our communication is on the app. The only notable thing is that my former phone's screen crashed and I had a period of inactivity before using this one. It may be because I haven't logged out from the other phone but please help quickly.

So message or media ends up deleting on both ends not just on the sender end.

Not everyone needs to see more than what they want, I prefer to only see status updates about my contacts. I don't see why they added that feature without the on or off option.

"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Recent uptade of the app has just converted its interface into a low class messaging app, as if the interface has been created by some amateurs with no idea of practical usage and placement of icons. Enlargement of tabs icon with bottom placement is hugely a hindrance in smooth usage as well as doesn't look elegant."

I'm so done with this app.. SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is becoming more and more like a social media platform like Facebook and Instagram,ect. with each and every update. This is a messaging app NOT a social media platform like Facebook and Instagram ect. I think the devs. should add an option to save status updates directly from the status bar in whatsapp to the gallery app of your device like in the GB WhatsApp Absolutely LOVE the new UI , where the Status , Updates etc. are at rhe bottom of the screen it's MUCH easier and more convenien"

When the phone rings I now have to swipe to unlock phone or enter password, press the app, then the small bar at the top, then swipe up to answer. It's a real pain. Please allow notifications as before! It's just a nightmare now!"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, what's the use of channels? I have a very great feeling that random things are just getting stored in the memory to which we are probably never even go and see them. We have similar features in Instagram and Facebook & I think that's pretty much enough. This is just taking a lotta space in WhatsApp. WhatsApp's main intention used to be means of communication. Maintain the same & try to improve features based of those. Like there's a new screen sharing thing, which I personally like. <3"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Thank you for supporting the usage of two numbers on one phone. However, there's a problem with that. When the app screen is set on one number, it doesn't notify you if there are messages or even calls on the other number. This means that I lose out on notifications until I manually switch account to another number. Could you please work on this? Thanks."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's perfect! But i gave it 2 starts because the UI is not giving a feeling of smoothness. Many messager apps like Facebook Messenger, signal messanger, imessage etc have a smooth UI. Please try to make the UI more smoother, glowy, personalised. In one word, it's ""BORING""."

I have very important message in the backup. I can't even reach the support team on anything and no one to solve the issue. It's really really bad. It's already good i don't know why they have to update and cause problems like this

"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The repositioning of the icons has made it abit of an inconvenience. It is abit difficult to see outstanding messages or if you have missed calls. Also the swipe function between the sections has made it much more difficult. Overall an amazing app but these updates makes it abit inconvenient to certain individuals.

You see less messages and the header for chats, status and calls at the bottom make it harder to navigate, as you will mistakenly clicking the tabs/ header you don't need to. Dear UI/ UX Researcher of Whatsapp, please do your job better. Thanks."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"WhatsApp trying to be new Instagram. What's the point man, leave it as it was. It's good earlier but now going towards worst. Recent update is not good, we can't view our own status in one go . Do something about this problem . A suggestion also - While we post something on status , sometimes we do spelling mistakes and we have to delete the whole status to put correct spelling. Provide a feature of editing status caption."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Very unhappy with the new UI, with massive icons taking up such a huge chunk of my chat list. I don't use the other screens at all, so it is just sitting there taking up space.

For example: create a separate colomn for chats, separate colomn for group chats like it is created for the status and calls.

It tells me about sending feedbacks and thingys"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Are you trying to make the user interface as un user friendly as possible? Why would you put the tabs at the bottom? The reason for it being at the top is so you dont accidentally press it while using the app. At least give us the option to chose where we want the different tabs to be.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My screen stucks on whatsapp and couldn't do anything unless I turn off and on the screen multiple times in a minute after this latest update. It's sooo annoying either I would stop using WhatsApp or buy a new phone. If the latter still doesn't work then I have to go to the first option which is so at disadvantage for me. Please resolve the issue.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The new user interface is annoying. The header bar being at the bottom of the screen is irritating me for some reason. What is the point of changing the interface when the previous one was perfect? Facebook algorithm has annoyed me to point of quitting. I also quit instagram and zuck wants to ruin whatsapp too. What's next? Ads?
"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's constant evolving makes it difficult to rate or comment about. As some updates are good from first issue and some make you wish you had not updated. At times bug's are not fixed as noted and some cases we do not accept change. But it's one of the best communication means I have to use daily.

You can send photos and videos and I just love it. But there's a slight problem,for some contacts or groups it doesn't let me make a voice call and it says that I can't voice call them. Now this is something that's bugging me. Please fix this WhatsApp."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good App, the new UI where the top bar have shifted to bottom is very inconvenient and totally not user friendly.

But recently I discovered that my WhatsApp now hangs(not all time though). When this happens it takes about 2 days to rectify itself. This makes it very difficult to use the app, as it keeps on saying force close. I've tried updating the app, but still, there are no changes."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New navigation bar update is awful. Moving the navigation bar to the bottom not only spoils the app experience but it also ignore visually impaired people who relied on the darker background to navigate well.

And no one tells me it's the connection.It's not the connection.I have to wait for like 15 minutes for a video.That's its length is only 50 seconds.Why you have to wait all this times just for this.It doesn't very funny And disappointe"

Now I can't take the screenshot of someone's display photo on the WhatsApp profile, message pops up, ""the organisation or the app does not allow taking screenshot or recording the screen"" why⁉️‼️⁉️ 🥺"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I don't like this new version of WhatsApp... This all updates shows under it... The all title are not looking perfect in the downside area.... Please remove it and do it like the same like exiting version..... However the one thing like when we send any videos to someone the it shows the present this is the only thing I see good.👍
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Hi Meta So i find a few things quite disturbing for instance the screenshotting of profile pictures that has been used against me. And I ( and other people) would suggest for an update to add a request bar for unknown people to text you, for instance the people who isnt on your contacts should request to the people they want to text to talk on Whatsapp. That would be much appreciated. So just a recap: 1. Request bar for unknown contacts"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app but I have a suggestion or a feature request, We now days use it as a mini CRM so it is better if you integrate some sort of notes adding to the conversation so that we keep track of where we left the conversation and also if there is possiblity to add Todo list and calendar management, this would make Whatsapp a great productivity tool."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Previous version was better, in the updated version, status update, community etc are shown at the bottom and we can not swipe, need to click on each option. In earlier version, these options were at top and simply by swipe, we were able to navigate to status , community , calls etc."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The feature when we click on a profile pic directly taking to status is stupid feature. Showing status must be limited to status tab. Its embarrassing when the status suddenly started playing when try to view the profile pic. Work on some relevant features like turning off the network connectivity to WhatsApp, so that someone can't get distracted...not the stuff like this."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Whatsapp should add the option to create folders so we can arrange and group our text and work. Its actually stressing. Also the number of chats we can pin should be increased and not limited to only 3. On the status, the status should be a like a click able button that returns us back to the top when we click it. Its annoying having to scroll back to the top when a feature like this could solve the problem. Those are my problems and not just mine"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is good, but kindly improve the quality of status. Whenever posting any video on WhatsApp status, it's getting too much blurred. I don't expect the ultra HD but atleast enhance the resolution. Also while uploading the video more than 30seconds it should auto split and upload in fregment or atleast give option to upload full video either fregmented or complete."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new feature in android,the navigation bar (status chat community),has moved to the bottom . don't line this feature. 2nd you can't take a screenshot of the profile pictures of friends. It is not right if someone is showing you your picture. There is no need for privacy. They already have the privacy option to whom they can show their profile picture. For these 2 reasons, I have reduced WhatsApp from 5 stars to 2 stars. Overall, app is fine. I would encourage them to revert those features."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's uneasy to click the, 'see more' link for overflowing status text due to the introduction of the reply input at the footer.

PLEASE FIX!!"

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,App is annoying and has limited features. The lock chat folder can't be hidden and that's sucks. Please enable a feature to hide the lock folder.Maybe WhatsApp should learn from the other mod versions that they are banning and let the app be more interesting to use. Also give us the option to personalise our home screen page. The bland green and white is irritating.Lastly please create a group tab separately from chats.

Why is that...? Other than this I've been using this app from a very long time and no such problem or issue caught my attention this much."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The most recent update (march2024) has a slower interface with screen transitioning. Opening a specific chat takes almost a second to load the next text platform and opening the emoji rack is a delay where a few set of emojis in left column is first visible and all other emojis appear next. The transition is disturbing. Please fix this update.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It is my humble request to the WhatsApp community to work on accessibility. Here are the issues that WhatsApp has brought with recent updates: 1. While chatting, typing the first character triggers TalkBack to announce ""send, send"" repeatedly, which is very annoying. 2. While recording a voice message, TalkBack reads previously received or sent messages loudly in between, disrupting the recording process. 3. Selecting multiple messages from the same chat displays unlabeled buttons between them."

You can create separate tab for channels but status listing like old interface is only good option , this can work for instagram , FB but not for whatsapp ,since , when people scroll for status , they only view it if something is interesting in it. Now we see DP , not the status in round bar , which is totally bad idea"

Reason being is I have a group of unrelated people I'm chatting with, but I want to group them together in a folder e.g pending deals, done deals, customers issues etc. So they don't know they're grouped together, but for me I could just open the folder to see all chats related to the title.

"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Hey whatsapp community.. At a time i am facing an issue of direct ringing without calling interface .what i actually mean is that whenever i call someone firstly it shows calling interface but when data on on another then ringing interface come.But at present it directly shows ringing while data off on another one at which i trying to call.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,There is no second opinion on WhatsApp becoming an essential part of our lives but somet people just want to use it for messaging and not status sharing or seeing. Whatsapp should give feature which can completely remove the status functionality and convert into just messaging app. That would make my life veey easier.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This new update is bad because of the swipe feature getting removed though the update tab location is perfect, why does it have to take out a great feature, It's not worth it. And the HD status still don't show for some videos. Worse, frame quality still gets reduced slightly unlike Instagram."

I Don't like the new update of Status,Calls,msg option move to down and even can't look status throw swaping left or right. If you want to open status click on status or want to call you need to tap on call. Before the update was good directly swape left or right you'll get call list or open's status. Hope, you bring swape option and again bring this options to up rather then down"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The switch accounts option on android no longer separates the two accounts into two separate WhatsApp apps.

With GB WhatsApp I could chat with friends who do not speak my language because it has an in-app translator. My individual chats, groups, communities and status updates were in separate tabs and I just side slide to get to what I wanted. I could schedule messages, select multiple chats to archive, pin, or delete. Save statuses I liked, view media without downloading them, etc!"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Hi everyone! I am using Whatsapp since it has launched.It had many features but now some updates are ruining the app. Now when you call someone it directly goes on (Ringing) mode. But before this update it tells that weather a person is Online or Offline. If the person was offline the call goes on (Calling) mode. If a developer sees this please fix this problem.It will mean a great. 😐😐😐
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The updated layout and colouring sucks for Android. Why do they want to change it. The layout was already fine. And the neon green really doesn't go well. idk if my phone got problem or is it after I updated got this issue. So the notification is being received very late after the person has sent the message.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Options to switch between dual accounts are bit inconvenient. Even for sharing a file from browser to a particular account we have to open WhatsApp and select the account first and keep it active before sharing. So having two separate WhatsApp app is more convenient as of now. Privacy settings for newly added contacts has to be shown by default while syncing with WhatsApp.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't know what happened just after the update , my message are not sending anywhere, looks like a network issue from your side , i tried changing my network too and also restarted the phone plenty of times , all other apps are working correctly even the telegram which creates a lot of issues in plenty of people's phone."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"2go couldn't stand the test of time because of lack of offline notifications. What WhatsApp came it with that function, it attracted the masses. In same way GB and the likes produced advanced features on WhatsApp. If the official WhatsApp was sensitive enough, they could have added some of those features e.g ability to see who comes online, to save pictures/status, choice of anti delete, beautiful themes etc. Whoever, want to make use of them can turn them on 😞."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Appalling. Deletes chats with no notice whatsoever. If you report a chat it will be deleted without notice! Customer service told me to reinstall the app to retrieve the chat they deleted. But failed to mention if I wasn't logged on on another device there was no way to reset encryption password. I've lost 11yrs of data I desperately need. Just shockingly bad design. Terrible chain of terrible service.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,the new Whatsapp interface is hard to use! Phone User usually see things from the upper to the middle of the screen and by moving the Chat-Updates-Communities-Calls tabs to the bottom of the screen is not a good idea... please bring the Tabs back to the upper side of the screen!!

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Everything was fine and great till whatsApp decided to change almost everything. NO ONE CARES ABOUT THE BROADCAST AND CHANNELS! WHO WANTS TO BE IN A GROUP WITH SABC2 ?? NO ONE! and the status updates layout and being able to see the status in the circle before tapping to view it needs to return. Everyone can agree that this new update is just a burden and ruined something that worked absolutely perfectly

Also add anti delete feature, anti view status and many more because I've been using GB WhatsApp but it's far better than this one. So to make these app more interesting please add the above features to ease our usage with the app. Add account shifting shortcut on the home screen for easy navigation.Also separate group's with chats.

When you move the ui to the bottom you either have to also move new messages down and realize how stupid, weird (or both) it looks or move it back up. It's fine if you change the tab icons but keep them up. And at least bring back the thing where if you scroll between tabs the tab selected blue thing moves as you scroll."

As I have seen below many people are facing the same issue still no changes been implemented by your side and seriously it's very annoying to see new the status.. please fix it and old version is far better than this new one specially the status part.

Only God knows even if they want to improve or not. App starts lagging after sometime after every fresh install. Reinstalling and initialising has become such a pain nowadays it will not be done before you try 100 times minimum. Always says 'Unable to connect.

It asked me to scan a QR code on the old phone to restore the chats but my old phone is lost and my new phone completed a back up accidentally and removed the old backup chats I had. This was a stressful experience due the QR code system, normally the backup chat would load automatically but in this even it did not and ended completing a new backup"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new update sucks. The status section is absolutely useless. I don't understand how the new look is even helping or attractive in anyway. It's absolutely useless. Why do you wanna always ruin something that's actually good in the name of ""enhancements"". Do you really have a lot of money to spend on your UX resources that you don't know what to do and keep modifying the existing UI in ways you'd like it to look?.. I clearly don't understand the new status section's purpose at all. Zero."

However what's unnerving is the fact, when receiving a voicemail the proximity sensor not only shuts off the display but also the voice message itself.

The tab being on the bottom is confusing & with the whole scrolling of chats etc. It just doesn't make sense at all. This is not a nice desire at all. I regret updating it honestly.

Apps Like Telegram keeps you logged in, it doesn't require any backup to back your data all you need is your phone number.

Chats are reassigned to the different people and groups. Random people added and removed from chats. It looks like you got messages from people you never chat. You got a full mess instead of sync. Shock!

Everytime I use a sticker from the very bottom, the stickers would reset to the top so, I would have to rescroll down again. Even when searching for a sticker the window would just jump by itself so I would have to scroll again."

The same with the ringing and calling update, those two words let us know if our call is actually coming through, but now they simply aren't there.

But I'm not happy with the WhatsApp call stuff: in the previous version, I could tell if my call had connected(""ringing"") or not(""calling"").

I used to be able to see 9 different conversations but now the banner is bigger, I can only see 8. Does the banner really need to be that big? Also when it was at the top it just blended in nicely as the background was green. Also I don't need 'updates' - it's a messaging app, not a photo sharing app. What is it with everyone trying to copy other apps!"

For example you post how you are feeling at a particular moment or you want to ask a question that should be responded in an hour then you won't bother deleting it.

The old was already good enough."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Translation of messages is unbelievable poor. WhatsApp should look at WeChat how this problem is solved. WeChat has a very easy in app translation. This should be very easy to incorporate in the app and it will make it easier to use when you're texting with persons or groups in several different languages.

"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Everything is good in new update I has a suggestion for you that for programmers like us facing issues while we transfer codes on whats app its became difficult for us to copy the code and pasting it again in IDE so if possible will you add a auto run button in the whats app so that we can run our codes easily in whats app itself. If the above thing works then there is no need of using laptop. We can run our codes in mobile itself.

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Self destruct timer only deletes messages on my end. Not from sender and reciever. That defeats the purpose. Idc if the other person has an old version of whatsapp. Even if it's 1 year behind in app updates. All whatsapp versions should delete messages both ends If 1 of them turns on the disappearing messages and should let the other side know. Use a swarm to clear this up.

I just want to use my 2nd WhatsApp. Now supposedly you can add 2 numbers to one WhatsApp but that doesn't work either. I have no down arrow next to my name. Typical when a great app gets purchased by a big name, they make it worse."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I want to address the issue of mixing the group chat with other features, it would be beneficial to partition them to enhance organization and navigation. Additionally, incorporating features in the privacy settings can offer users a sense of control over their interactions and information shared.

It's a messaging app and now, where is easy to press my mistake, taking up screen space, is a block that I will never use. If I want updates and communities I'll use Facebook or Instagram. Huge backwards step for the app."

WhatsApp used to be very personal texting and calling app but now there is so much promotional messages coming all the time, they keep changing the interface unnecessarily which is annoying."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The updated app immediately noticed that all calls were gone to ""Ringing"" while waiting for the connection, whether there was a possible connection. I don't like it. ""Calling,"" Let me know there is no signal from the receiver and let me know that my call is running. I don't need to send a message to the receiver to verify this. I don't like this update please solve this problem 😞"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Nice app but try to update the settings of which someone can only see the blue stick after you reply to there message, to save status as well as hiding people from forwarding section, separate the groups and chat corum, that's the reason why I have just given it one star, Perhaps it can be good and thank you 🙏"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,i have a suggestion: I want security for my achieved chats. I mean reopening that achieved chats should be protected Chats. It should ask security for reopening message. It will make privacy secure. So without locking Smartphone other person will not able to check chats. 👉 Important. And another thing is there should be groups tab. So we can easily find groups in WhatsApp.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Since the new update, the app functions without Internet. I cannot scroll and read messages. Once Internet comes on, it just hangs and I cannot chat efficiently. it could hang for over 10mins. please do something about it. thank you"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This is PATHETIC You copy app features from other apps. 0 ideas of your own seems to me Now you move the damn status and message bar to the botom WHERE IT IS RIGHT IN THE WAY. Get a grip on life and find you own features move the stupid bar back to the top where it is out of the WAY. If it was not for some people on my contact list. Your app would have been in my rubbish bin.

"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This new update has been disappointing. Why would put the navigation bar at the bottom and disable the swiping feature which allowed more convenience and accessibility for users. This problem needs to be resolved.

That was convenient to switch, now we have to click everythime."

Thank you"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"WhatsApp changed how it looks on your phone. They put some buttons at the bottom, and lots of people find it annoying, including me. It would be better if WhatsApp let us choose if we want the old look or the new one with the buttons at the bottom."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Customer support dreadful. Insist on sending the same information over and over again. Information is incorrect and you can only get so far before the next option they instruct you to click on is not available. You explain this to them and they send you the exact same information again.

Please include an option to swap the positioning of statuses and channels, I prefer my statuses to be vertically arranged while channels can be horizontally arranged. 2.

Inclusion of stealth removal from a group 4. Realtime private chat that clears automatically after the chat is closed."

Chats and groups being in the same page is really annoying. We have 20 groups and looking for personal chat is way too hard. Developers please do use what's app personally and update it for users comfort
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The recent update of moving options down the screen is not user friendly. It is completely inconvenient to use. Fix it asap.. previous interface with tabs on top was much comfortable to use.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So. The whole design spontaneously changed for no apparent reason and with no warning. I have not updated the app in a while so it should not change unprompted. The new design is completely different, in no way intuitive and just simply too ""modern"", or whatever it is trying to be."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is great for messaging and calling and you can also customize the BG's! It works really well, doesn't crash, and loads well. The only downside is that the emojies look really different."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is just awesome it connects people very frequently and conveniently used. It makes the communication easier and faster with the people who are too far in foreign countries too.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The WhatsApp interface suddenly changed with icons moving at bottom...It is highly irritating coz I can't go to the status or calls sections by simply swiping the screen..

Open up Whatsapp and put your location manually and input your number as you regularly would, when it prompts you to confirm your number, turn off airplane mode and press OK. This should let it reset and you should receive another SMS which should verify. (This won't delete backed up messages)."

So previous option was nice and easy to determine whether person is available or not reachable. So this update need to be changed."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I do not like the update with the settings at the bottom of the chats page. So no you end up calling people by mistake. Its forcing you to view ppls status now. Forcing you to view channels you don't want to see. Just annoying. Lol. Stop tryna get in ppls personal space. Facebook is already doing that. Cut it out. Just cut it out. And when someone is being added to a call. It should ring.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Please, i like WhatsApp. But i honestly feel like every update it gets worse and worse. The new UI doesn't look nice and it makes it uncomfortable to look at.Because the bottom looks way too big when compared to the top.

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to be good but now its the worst app ever. They put in some bunch of features we don't need and its ruining the app. They've put the navigation panel to bottom which is ruining the user experience and from last update they changed ""status"" to ""updates"".

"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Ok app. Extremely basic. Nothing special Can't even zoom in on text chats which makes it hard to use if you have vision problems. Emojis are tiny and impossible to see. Some are randomly animated when used alone but no indication of which.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I remember back In the day you could undo an update and this is such occasion I wish I could. With everything on the bottom now I keep changing between sections. I don't use anything bar the chat and when it was on the top I never miss pressed anything. Why change an already good and well liked lay out for customers as at the end of the day we us it.

I first did not like it when the status got changed to have other things that you cant take away, but now this layout is very disapointing. If WhatsApp could make it optional (the original layout in 2023 and the new one from 2024), I am sure many people would like that. Please change this WhatsApp, Thanks."

Why doesn't WhatsApp differentiate the icons for 'Group' and 'Regular Chat', this is more useful for me. Especially for people who have lots of groups and chats, so they don't get mixed up. I think the developers have thought about this idea, and it would be great if it actually came to fruition."

You also can't take a document of any account's profile photo, which is too bad. If someone harasses you by sending messages then you cannot take the photo as evidence for legal action in future."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Latest version update is worst. Who gave the IT team this pathetic idea to shift the options on the bottom of the screen? You guys want to make the friendly UI or a complicated one? Please shift the options back on the top of the page.

The calling option, prior to the upgrade, you could tell if someone is online or not when calling as it would first indicate ""calling"" if not online or ringing then would switch to ""Ringing"" if online and actually ringing. The recent upgrade took this out and I personally don't like it Whatsapp team should do something about it. Thanks 👍"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've had no issues with this app until recently. I can't send videos ( they are under 16mb) and also can rarely send gifs that are in the app! Same phone, same video settings, nothing has changed on my end. Did a Google search and many people are having the same problem."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Improve the video quality of videos shared in status. It goes from 1080p to 144p.....The video quality becomes really bad.... & Also Increase the duration of video uploaded + also some song additive tools can be inserted in status bar just as Instagram.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Whatsapp,I'm happy with the developments that continue to be made. There is one suggestion I want to make, can you make ""Auto Translate"" option in every conversation? I had problems when my Indonesian-speaking parents had to translate every conversation my husband had which he basically spoke English and vice versa. I hope you can consider this, because I'm sure many people also use Whatsapp to talk between countries. Because now to be honest, we have to translate manually with Google Translate."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Impossible to login in some circumstances. After many attempts to log in even from the same device where the sim is inserted, nothing worked. First, WhatsApp prohibited me from receiving calls. And sms didn't come because apparently their sms service for +7 country code numbers was down. I contacted the customer support. They answer very fast but they don't read the questions. The answers were totally useless. Will move to the blue messenger completely."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"For past few releases of the android app, no matter stickers of any kind, when selected, the group keeps popping to the top of the selected group everytime any sticker is used in chat from said group (no exception) it's very annoying because most sticker groups are very large and sometimes you want to send stickers that are side by side or nearby Please revert back to the old style where position stays the same after selecting the sticker If other gifs or emotes affected, please fix too"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It seems whatsapp is desperate to make some kind of update, whatever the heck that pops to their heads. Such as the reason for moving all the tabs down to the screen and make us unable to swipe through each tab as we were used to... Now we have to get adjusted to this all over until some freaking dev decides to change format agin. How annoying! 😑"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Edit: Thank you for multi-account support.But you have brought in another feature not needed for whatsapp, channels.The current way of implementing it creates bad experience. Channels should be generally available in the app, no problem.People will find them by searching. But creating a separate ""featured channels"" gives an unwelcome feeling about the app. Note: I have never used stories by not giving whatsapp contact permission.But currently there is no way to hide the featureed channels."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Not good this aap is getting worse day by day because from the last few updates every time I downloaded anything from WhatsApp auto -dowloaded is turned off. I can see the media only for a short while after that I have to download it again and I can only keep repeating the same thing few times and after that the app tell me to ask the after person to resend it again it is my humble request to the WhatsApp community to work on it. Thank you 🙏
"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's a amazing application for digital communication. I have been using it from last 6 to 7 year . All nessasary update comes in app But I would like to give a small suggestion that in next update please give a draft option in mobile app during chat if I type something and unfortunately app was closed so my must get backup in chat as a draft so i can continue my message even after reopening of the chat.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I cannot stress enough how bad it is that messages can disappear. Are you covering up criminal evidence or information helpful in court or something? WhatsApp used to be about sending pictures and voice files additional to text, groups for studying, friendship or common projects, family and other contacts you knew and were close to irl. Trying to become not-whatsapp, and ""this app stops working if you don't update it"" will frustrate a lot of users."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,All the features were running perfectly but after this recent update I found a issue in call setting. The issue is this that when you dial someone it start showing ringing even the other person is not receiving call ( means offline ) . It makes us unaware of other person's offline or online status.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I use this app endlessly and all was well. Just changed to a Pixel 8 and the display is terrible. I cannot change the size of the fonts and in general, the display is super dense. Also, I really don't like the green color of the messages and cannot change it. Can anything be done?"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I was using WhatsApp from many years it is very good platform but the new update which WhatsApp made separate menu for community and stop the sliding option to change between menu is very bad. Because users were addicted to slide and change between chart and statuses but now it is irritating to use kindly bring back the option to slid and change between menu.

I keep receiving registration codes I never asked for, notifications about it in app, automated calls for it even. I reached out to the support twice and both times I was met with unhelpful automatic responses that were not even relevant to the issue - the bot (because there will be NO human reading, I assure you) just picks a random keyword from your message and send a faq. Impossible to receive real help."

I know of more than 3 people struggling with this issue. Please address to this issue. My friends already complained about the inconvenience. Our last resort is to switch to another communication app.

"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Watsapp is a good app for communicating with people... but unfortunately, lately after this new update, there is a bug with the stickers, we go looking for the stickers and the Watsapp screen keeps freezing. The WhatsApp company should remove that message that says ""YOU DELETED THIS MESSAGE FOR EVERYONE"". Because it doesn't make sense for me, to delete a message that I don't want my contact to see, and WhatsApp shows the deleted message. Please change this!"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"After installing the new update the app starts messing up. It shows ""ringing"" even when the contact you're calling is not online instead of ""calling"". Also it's impossible to minimize a video call to a portion of your screen. My phone is the s23 ultra so I doubt if it has to do with the phone itself. Please fix it 🙏"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"does the job as a messenger app. Automatic image compression is sometimes annoying and should be ootional. Also tge limit if 16mb for mp3 files is ridiculous - you allow sending images and videos that are much larger, but for >16mb audio files I need to use an archive to be able to send it??!"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Experience has been horrible because of WhatsApp on trying to move to ios. Even after multiple attempts cannot receive the verification codes. WhatsApp single handedly has made experience to switching phones the most dreaded thing ever. Zero human contact and interface has made things even worse. Cannot get a decent reply just copy paste bot answers. Useless little app yet most of my life's chat history and important data is saved on it. Horrible and worst support ever for today's day and age
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The original sucks, I like being able to see deleted messages and status, that is why so many prefer Whatsapp Plus. If the original had at least those two things and being able to change the fonts, then the original would be awesome, now it's just boring compared to plus. And I hate that the original forces you to keep using it by not letting you use plus which is more fun in comparison."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love that whatsapp finally added the feature where i can log in to my account on another device, but please let me update my status on the secondary device, too. It is such a hassle to look for my main phone just to update status or having to send the photos i took for status updates to the other phone just to post it. Hope you're gonna give us that update!"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. Though I want to give an idea..I have been tired to adjust the status privacy. It would be easier if they had a custom one where you can divide for each groups. Also,I'd like to give this a five stars,it's very useful hihi"

I wish there was a setting to opt out of receiving messages from Business or block receiving messages from persons who aren't in your address book... there is absolutely no way to block receiving spam... I've never spoken to a legitimate business on WhatsApp, its ALWAYS SPAM!!!!!!! Every fkn day!!!!!!"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The latest update 2.24.3.81 has stopped my ability to create or make any changes to my Avatar. Pressing any picture tiles does nothing. I have removed and reinstalled, I have deleted and recreated my account and this issue remains. The WhatsApp Support appears to be a totally useless A.I system. Videos of the issue which I was asked to forward blantantly highlighted the issue along with detailed text, but all I got was repeat questions and answers that bore no relevance to the issue. Dreadfull."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is very convenient and easy to use, no doubt about it...But the latest update regarding the sections above that has status/chats/calls is not very convenient to use, It's almost a replica of iOS WhatsApp display. The Android display was much better and hope it's retained in the future."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is fine in of itself, but there are some features from apps like GB WhatsApp that are very nice to have. E.g. Separation groups from individual chats, makes it so much nicer and more organised. Another is being able to download statuses, would be nice to have it as a built in feature instead of having to rely on third party apps. Also, let me pin as many chats as I want, why is there a limit?"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I don't usually write reviews of apps but . I recently experienced the latest WhatsApp UI update, and my feelings about it are a bit mixed. While I appreciate the efforts to innovate and refresh the interface, I find the new design somewhat confusing and different from what I was accustomed to. The previous UI had a simplicity that I found intuitive, and the current one seems a bit more complex. I request WhatsApp Team to bring back the Old UI"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"You guys are trying, keep the good work But then I just wish you can bring in some new features like, when checking the list of people that had viewed ones status, you can just easily tap the persons name and be able to send a direct message to the person. Its really an incredible app thou"

I mean when I record voice the msg is all blank nothing is recorded... I tried many things but nothing really helps... Hope it will work soon
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app work great until the UX team decided to move the tab on the bottom and remove swiping with no way to back to previous UX. Of course the app look better now but it's now hard to go between Chat and Stories without swiping.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"We don't need Channel in whatsapp.. the previous status interface(vertical) is way better than now(horizontal).. we need basic whatsapp interface.. and the recent update is the worst update..its not updating,its degrading.. If u guys want so called updated whatsapp then give us customized option where we can use previous version or older version of whatsapp.. Earlier it was user-friendly and now it is business-friendly... No-one is satisfied with ur update.. thank you !!!"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"You guys have done wonderful work on this app. It now has more security features than before. If you guys could consider improving the aesthetic aspect of it by adding more themes to the background. I suggest optional bubbles designs for the messages, with beautiful color choices. Also consider optional fonts styles and colour to make the write ups beautiful, no other could measure up to it. Thanks"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Decent app but bloody hell stop changing the layout! My status has just updated to be at the bottom and now it is just gross to look at but also inconvenient and annoying. The change was unnecessary and has not made the app better at all
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New menu at the bottom of the page is terrible. I'm sure half these changes only occur because people are employed to design, and if they weren't constantly designing a new feature or a new look for the app...well then they wouldn't be employed. It's nothing to do with making it better, easier to use, or more intuitive."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I am unable to find the reason of changing the positions of chats,calls, status tabs. Just change it to the default it was more convincing. The Two stars are for only that reason nothing much."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Whatsapp is a great one to communicate with the people you want to. But my problem is that it keeps on decreasing the quality of my pics when I upload my updates. Idk what the reason is. I tried reinstalling and updating to the newversions. I even tried to decrease fhe size of my pics. Nothing works. Please fix this issue.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"1. Theme customization: While dark mode is great, additional themes on Android would be fantastic for user preference. 2. Interface options: Hiding unused sections like ""Communities,"" ""Channels,"" and ""Status"" would be helpful for those who don't use them. 3. Home page logo: The large ""WhatsApp"" logo on the home page could potentially be made smaller to provide more space for other information."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have not been able to hear contacts on video calls for months now. They sound like robots, at times I might hear every 3rd word, but today I could not hear half the conversation. I have contacted WhatsApp support numerous times, but with no help yet, they keep closing the chat, before fixing the problem. Very frustrating."

Just keep it simple 🤦🏾‍♀️"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"New update labels every call as ""Ringing"" from the start, even when the person is offline and the number isn't connected. It doesn't start first by ""Connecting"" the call and then letting you know it's ringing once it has gone through"

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I really don't like the way the update page looks I don't even like the channels that was included now the status of my contacts are squeezed up into one line and the channels stuff fills the screen even when I didn't agree to the terms and conditions of it I would love the old page concerning the status of my contacts which allows me to easily find status and know which I've viewed and those muted and also the search bar to find a particular status
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"After recent updates, there is one problem appearing in WhatsApp, when you send bulk images and there is some network problem, we can't identify which image has been sent and which images is yet to be sent.

I have tried to reach out in every possible manner however there is no response or support from their end. I am not recieving OTP to login to my account. All i am getting are useless resolutions stating that there is issue either with my device or my network provider, where as I getting OTPs for all other apps from the same network provider and same device. Pathetic service must say."

This flaw needs to b addressed n corrected to the earlier version of scrolling up and down.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Introduce time variation for status/story. Not every story has to be there for 24 hours. Yes, we can delete it when we want to take it down but it makes people look awkward. 6 hours, 12, 24 variations before uploading a whatsapp status/story would be welcomed in the next update."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Whatsapp is an amazing app. However, it will be much cooler if most of the features available on GB & FM whatsapp are added to it. I am confident that your tech-team can achieve this. We look forward to it!"

All of a sudden everything is a eye sore cheap looking white instead of the peacefull background greens it used to have. Also the introduction of AI even in this chat app is so unnecessary. The new community and avatar features? stop trying to become a social media platform pleas and stay a simple messenger app like you're supposed to be. Meta keep your hands off this app it doesnt need to be more!"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great for texting and video calls. It has been giving me a lot of backup notifications that don't go away. Other than that great app and useful for group chats across different phone brands.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"In Telegram, If we have to bolden or italicise a word or sentences, simply we need to copy and click. But it whatsapp why is it that the copied words get bracketed with esterics mark or other symbols which makes it outdated. I must say telegram is doing far better in terms of providing features and facilities to its users."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Excellent app, I wish it would have the double tap texts functionality for reactions. It would be good ig group chats and personal chats are on separate pages. An idea would be to provide a variety of many colours for the font and background olin written statuses.

Have been using this app since 2019 without much trouble but then my number got banned from using whatsapp 10 days ago, although I'm pretty certain that I've not done anything against the term of service and when I tried contacting the whatsapp team they reply with same automated messages, meaning it's likely useless thinking contacting them would help in any way.

Now I can't even hold my phone with one hand and swipe to status cause ofc you gotta be different and try to be like dc so you make a new @ss layout for literally no danm reason. You guys reallly suck for doing that. Just make it an option to switch back to the old layout. Other than that the app is good and everything works fine.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Probably the best messenger of all due to its universality across multiple platforms, but still could be better. Biggest plus is sending pictures - it keeps almost the same resolution. But it's most major flaw is no way to simply block an unknown contact/number from outside your contacts (not a message/chat but a call)."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I think that anyone want to make new whatsapp because from last updated my phone broke and I switched to another phone without log out from the 1st phone because it display is not working, the main problem is that in my new phone ~I want to verify my account day by day~ this is very annoying. What kind of verify daily when I already verify once. 😤😤😤😤😤"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Why do you guys keep on making changes to classic features. Who th thought it was a good idea to shift the status bar to the bottom? Years of familiarity with a classic and user friendly view is now ruined. Meta should fire whoever approved this change. Forcing a user with a bad UI/UX just because you have monopoly of the messaging market is just terrible.

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"All though whatsaap is very simple to use, but now days they have updated the app and some new features have popped up. Among these features the 'Channels' is the most disgusting one, like I'm getting some really nonsense and irrelevant channels which are totally waste of time and I even don't want to see these channels' names or thumbnails, but I can't do anything with these. I hope meta will do something about it. These feature is really disgusting."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,have been using this app since long a lot of progress had been made and it is quite helpful but there are somethings which should be done in the next update please take it as a request. There should be a proper way of hiding the chats since the chat lock is not supported in many device it only supports in device with fingerprint and in other devices this feature is just useless! If new features are made then it should be supported in all devices.

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"WhatsApp is a big company and some basic features if exist, should work well without impacting my experience. 1. Adding account to the same app overwrote some images from the chats in the first account. The images which were overwritten were also backed up. 2. Even though you have both accounts, only one account is active at a time 3. The other account is inactive and does not receive messages and does not back up"

It has come to my attention that the 'About' section is not functioning properly. Whenever I attempt to change my about, the app displays a message indicating that it is updating, only to later inform me that the update couldn't be completed, and I should try again. It's been two months this cycle of frustration has persisted..I hope that the issue can be resolved swiftly so that I can enjoy it."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is good. However, I would suggest they include a central point setting that allows you to hide media from gallery, instead of having to go chat by chat, and also a feature for reposting a status without having to screenshot or asking someone to send it to you. Also , it would prefer the chats and groups to be placed in different tabs; one for chats and the other for groups."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Hated the page menu on the bottom of the screen when you tried to implement it months ago and I hate that you try it again.

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't like writing reviews, but the new update is just terrible. Like, what is this terrible UI you've implemented?

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I've had whatsapp for years. Never had a single issue with it. I recently switched my phone number from PR to USA and it will NOT let me change my phone number on the app. Won't even let me create a new account for my new number. It keeps saying there's an error cannot send message try again in 1 hour. Same thing when I try the call feature. I've tried everything support has told me to do and get more increasingly upset with each automatic reply I get from support.

For me the App is just boring and a bit outdated. I see other messenger app, they always have updates with new features, their UI is just beautiful.

I hope you understand me."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Yes, this app is great since Whatsapp has been an evolving and fascinating form of communication that's easy and convenient. The developer should consider adding some features such as separate individual chats to those of group chats.

"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is and has been good generally but apart from the Status arrangement problems and image quality I feel Whatsapp should find a way to strike a heavy balance between it and the other varieties to ensure adequate privacy. For instance I might set a message on ""view once"" and then someone with another whatsapp variety can infiltrate it, please you guys should look into it and I don't really see a need to the ""off read receipt"" feature cuz it kinda paves a gateway for someone to spy on you."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I hate this app😭 I haven't been able to log back into my account and I'm been trying for days now and still I haven't gotten any verification code or call verification. Almost all my contacts are on my whatsapp account yet it kept saying I should try again in 24 hours or even an hour later but still the same result. So frustrating

I want to register my WhatsApp in my new phone but back up and chat tranfer features are not working many times I have tried but result is same. which is so annoying.

"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Application is using by World 🌍 Wide. But When Uploaded any Status like Photo and Video. Image and video Quality automatically reduce and look like very poor blurry image of status. This improvement is Very important to do in WhatsApp. When Call Quality also not showing better when Network is 5G Also.

"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Whatsapp feature and channel are annoying WhatsApp can see other app like wechat, telegram, Snapchat bla bla.. WhatsApp put the channels in same page of updates, it should be separate status and channel, it's our choice. Unnecessary showing us this on the updates page. There is no edit option, delete option, atleast recall is best option instead of deleting. Should be add more option as ID base instead of mobile. I don't think so, who's selecting such feature. Which is going to annoying now."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,We need less updates of different channels to follow and more functionality updates. We need to be able to pin more than 3 people if needed maybe up to 10. We also need the option to share screens too. We also need the option to allow mic access to work beyond the app. You can't multitask on your phone while on a whatsapp call. People won't hear you. Even when the screen times out it's a problem.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I personally think that for safety reasons there should be an alert and then a way to accept or decline a group request. I hate that I add just be added into them without my consent, reguardless of them being in your contacts or not. And let's be honest kids are using the app and can be added into groups that are not appropriate. I think the same about numbers not in your contacts being able to send messages, again I think it should send a request first."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This was my worst experience on WhatsApp. I had also backed up the data but after running it on another phone the backup did not come back and all my data was lost. There is no verification message or verification call coming to run WhatsApp. They block it again and again, sometimes for one hour and sometimes for two hours, and even though my SIM card is inserted in this phone, this problem is still occurring."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Good app but it's irritating when I send one sticker wanting to send more than one but it sends me back to the top leaving me to scroll all the way back down to where I was initially. Fix that please and thank you.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,2024 and that's the best you can do? Be ashamed.... I've got probably the best camera phone on the market and WhatsApp doesn't seem to be able to take a decent photo or video. I have to exit the app and take it on my camera app and send that or you can literally see nothing. It's ridiculous. Apparently men have been sent to the moon and a phone call was made with 0 delay in the 60s but you can't send anything other than blurred or out of focus videos or images?
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The recent 2 account update is causing issues with the notification and sharing option, 1- you can only share with the current selected account (we should be able to select which account we want to share with even if it was not selected) 2- if you receive calls for the other account they are muted and you only see the notification but phone will not ring. Only the currently selected account recieves calls 3- notifications are very bad. No details only that this person contacted you."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new update putting status bar at the bottom is very annoying. Why move away from existing one ? The new status bar is ugly with very big icons. Its hard to click on larger devices. Please, whatsapp revert this useless update."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,In my uttermost opinion this app is awesome here are my reasons for saying that 1. You can talk even if your halfway across the world to each other. 2. You can call and text. 3. You can chose video or voice call. 4. The app has never crashed for me. 5.Its 100% free and America barely has any free apps or online platforms and FREE TRAILS AREN'T FREE there a scam!:(
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It would really be convenient if we could archive the community announcements. Its really inconvenient when its all just there on your chat window with the latest update. You could archive it earlier but now it just doesn't happen. An option to do that would ve really helpful.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If there was a zero star I would give it, why can't they develop a version that can download the statuses automatically, be able to change the font and add a lot of features?

"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hi whatsapp "" [ what is the feeling is that all messengers , chat apps should have dedicated PIN to find hidden contacts and the hidden contacts shall not appear in the main contact box , it's a better option than the lock contact feature and hidden contacts can only be found by the 🔍 search tool and which may appear when putting the dedicated PIN and then immediately gets locked and hidden again when the chat or texting is over ]"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"For me, using Whatsapp has always been an amazing experience. But I seem to have a problem when sharing videos of large memory quantity. It always cuts or cracks making the video look like it is of poor quality, I hope that something can be done about that . Aside that, I really can't think of anything which needs changing, developing or, updating. Thank you."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Whatsapp was basically a communication app which was very convenient to use. But now with the latest updates to keep up with the market and not sure what other reasons, the app is being very complicated and becoming like all the other social apps. No one actually needs Facebook or Insta inside Whatsapp."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"First off, the quality of images and videos reduce drastically when shared on Whatsapp. Secondly, when a chat is edited or deleted, the other party shouldn't be notified. Thirdly, I can no longer search a particular status. I'll have to keep scrolling until I see what I want. This is really tiring. I really do think the status is best set vertically than horizontally. I'll appreciate if these things are worked on Thanks 👍"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"By Mistake I have uninstalled my WhatsApp . After that I installed WhatsApp and tried to register but was not able to get the code as well Other verification methods are also not working for me . I have a stable internet connection, working sim with unlimited recharge plan. I am trying to get code since 1 month . And They didn't not even gives gives reply to help up - Emails and not provides any help or Solution . Worst App . Worst Experience."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The quality of my sent pictures is reduced drastically, and there's no option to remove this. If there are no options, then the default should be sending the pictures in their original quality. The ""HD""option doesn't work with any of my photos either. This is so annoying. Please, fix it; it's usually inconvenient sending pictures in document form."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"WhatsApp is a very useful app. I can't complain about it much. It does have good privacy but I could complain about one thing. If I turn off my read receipts that means I don't want someone to know that I read their message, but when you click on message info it shows whether the message has been delivered/read or not, which really makes no point in turning off read receipts. My suggestion? Do something about it in the next updated version. Like remove read, but delivered can stay. PLEASE!!🙂"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The recent update made me feel worst. The more brighter green colours are making it worst to chat at night. The symbols of each icons are changed, which is not comfortable. Please update this to any other form or bring back the last update. Make it as soon as possible."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Amongst all bugs and no-info-privacy features mentioned by others, I've got one problem with an old-time feature of the app. When pictures/videos are sent in a group or next to each other, they form a block, which makes it impossible to reply to a particular item sent. It's find to group them, but we should still be able to reply to a picture/video if we want to."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,There are 2 major issues I absolutely hate about this app. 1) PLEASE introduce an option to turn off the new feature CHANNELS. I and everyone I know hates it! 2) Written text is not being saved longterm as a draft if you leave it unsend due to a phone call interruption or distraction. It is frustrating to loose all of your draft text by the next time you get back to that chat a few hours later or the next day. App saves it only for a short time. This doesn't happen with any other texting app.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is great. However, I don't know if it's my phone's fault (Galaxy A54) or not, but when someone sends me a message, it doesn't pop up on the bar notification at all, and it doesn't have sound either. I've checked the settings, and still, i won't receive messages, and I have to check them by opening the app. It's really frustrating cause I have to check the app frequently to see if I received messages from someone or not."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I came to make a request this is not my phone. My phone is HUAWEI y7a it didn't support play services. Before I used whatsapp by downloading apk. After this month continuesly banned my three numbers as mod user. But I didn't use any mod. I had made many requests to WhatsApp using their support email they not tried bit to give me a support. They can't understand their fault. I'm truly disappointed about your service. I lost my all educational and important things due to this situation.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I've tried to re-login into the App but can't. It tells me that I have to wait for 1 hr before they can send me the 6-digit code and I've been waiting and trying for 3 days but it's still the same. I've checked the Internet Connection I've checked the Phone number correctness I've checked the country code But it's still not working...
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Whatsapp is a great app! But recently I've been experiencing a bug while posting a video longer than 30sec on ""Status"" when I'm trying to trim the remaining parts of the video to 30sec or less. (The first part of the 30sec of the video is normal, *but the trimmed part of the video gets abnormal, like the voice comes before and different from the movement and demonstrations in the videos*). It wasn't always like that until recent updates to the app, Please look into it."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've had this app since 2012/13 and it's always been my favorite. Ever since adding all the features it's been so many different glitches. Mostly being audio issues. Example: If you receive a call on your regular line while on a WhatsApp video call, that will cause the other parties not to hear you. We usually reboot our phone, or uninstall/reinstall, but we really shouldn't have to do that! I will be glad to remove this review once this issue is fixed!"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is great. An improvement would be to have the option of individual schedule messages like 'samasung messages' can. That way, you can schedule a one-off message, and it will get to them like a normal message. - like if you know you'll be away from your phone over a weekend but still want to wish someone a happy birthday, for example. It won't tell the recipient it's a scheduled message. That would be an amazing added feature! 👌🏼"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Oh, a junk! You cannot install it without a phone number. You do not have backup. The new feature of new account is useless as it doesn't blend the messages, you have to switch accounts to see if someone wrote something. Better the old way of dual installation. On PC works just sometimes - most of the time says phone is disconnected. I have to just start the app on phone to be able to use it. What does it mean? Such a junk."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Each update is ruining the app, still it was fine, but now it takes time to send even a single image (no issue with my internet), even longer videos are sent easily but a single image stays stuck at 50% for quite some time, and when it is finally sent, the confirmation sound rings twice. Kindly fix this issue, it's a pain to send images during chat. If it's fixed, i will gladly raise the rating to 4 stars."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The LAST SEEN is not working for the past week! It even shows the wrong date & time for myself. I've uninstalled/reinstalled. I looked for updates; I'm using the latest version. I restarted my phone several times. Also, my phone is new, Android 13. This app started this issue last week. Until then, there were no issues. Also, people are reading & replying to my messages, but their ""two gray dots"" are not turning blue and yes, they have ""read receipts"" turned on."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"App is wonderful. But even after these much features, you are failed to give an option to export multiple files. It's possible in iPhone (iOS). If someone send me multiple documents/images and I have to email them, the only option left with me is to save them one by one, and then I can attach it to mail. There is no option to export/save them all at once. Please work on it."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,WhatsApp has been very good and friendly but I don't like the recent update. It makes it difficut to view status. It will be very nice if you can as well delete sent images or videos for everyone after 3 days

Whenever I'm trying to Register my number, it is saying your number is not allowed to use WhatsApp. It's my personal number and i never used it for any unusual thing, but still getting same error always.

Thank you"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Clicking on the ""Reading More"" is more difficult to achieve what it was meant for, you click on it and the message box pop up instead of the message embedded into the read more text.

Earlier version were so cool as all option are at the top and much easier to check by sliding this new update were icons are big and over bulky looks like a scifi UI.

The unofficial ones have quite a number of interesting features which this one does not have and I'll highlight a few. 1. Chats and groups are separated while on this one everything is all in one place making it quite disorganized. 2. I get to choose who can call me or wether I want to receive calls or not but here there is no such option. 3 Status saving

I like the way it has been constantly improving to suit the interest of the user. It's quite user friendly and it keeps on getting better. However, I would suggest that the app intergrates a feature that would enable one to scroll through chats using specificied dates or months or even years. I at times have lengthy conversations and scrolling to a specific date becomes hectic, especially when it's been a while back"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Terrible. It blocks my account every day without giving reasons. I keep applying for a review only to be blocked again. It's too frustrating. In addition, it claims I am using an unofficial application yet I downloaded from its official website and Android playstore! Just lucky that i even gave a two star rating. One or even zero should be befitting for an app that only works less than a day before being blocked for no reason."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Great chatting app I have ever used. But It's time you separate individual chat from Group chats and also increase the number of individual or group messages one can pinned. Individual and Group messages at same place makes the use of the app unattractive and boring.

They don't have a calling option and then this glitch where we don't even get a verification code at all irrespective of how many times u try. If we try too many times, it says you guessed many times. That's not what I was expecting from WhatsApp. Like they should surely have a clear assistance and have the glitch cleared. It was very embarrassing that we thought it got hacked and informed everyone about it."

Everytime it says wait for 6 hours before trying again and like that it has been more than 24 hours. Their support is useless because all they do is send automated messages which just adds on to the torture.

Another glitch is that it now takes long to ""initialize"" or ""backup"""
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The update is really very good. But how can I be updating one app every month. I updated the last one on 26 February 2024 and on 10th March you are asking me to update only to find one update. Its really tiring. Please I will like to be able to save status and copy caption or repost just like Gb. It will really be of help.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Always use it for group chats and just normal texting it's End to End encrypted so they do not listen or read what you are saying to the person on the other end of the phone which is handy and secretive unlike apps such as Snapchat this is safer and easier for kids because the only people who can contact them are the people in their contacts or the people who have their number and most sensible children don't give out their phone numbers. Stay Safe! 🪷🌴💅🏼😜🍓🔥🧬
"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app but I have one suggestion, kindly add chat delete option datewise like when we want to delete chat from a particular date to some other particular date we could do that...Plzz work on it as a suggestion from your user...rest the app is fantastic..."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,For some reason in the latest update whenever I open a chat it takes me back to either the beginning of the conversation or the middle then I have to scroll all the way down... And also the notifications ain't popping up unless I open the app which is really annoying sts..

"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"5 stars when WhatsApp will finally give different column for group chats and private message 🥲🙏 When you're involved in multiple activities and communities, you are unavoidably and inevitably added into more groups than you can count. So just entering whatspp is overwhelming, it makes you avoid whatsApp even though you need to use it. It's not just me, many, if not all of my friends dislike WhatsApp for this very reason. Here's to hoping there will be separate columns for them🥲"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The app is amazing 😍 But I wish they could improve it to the extent that without one's Gmail backup and phone the person can still get there old messages in a new phone back 😩 Or even make it so that people that have your contact and you don't have there's can view your status because of certain reasons though
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is the worst. My account suddenly got terminated or suspended for ""spamming"". Bro, I did not do it to my friends, nor bothering to spam whom those listed on my contact lists. I was watching a live stream on my phone when one of my friends sent me a message; i answered back but accidentally sent it to my other friend while the live stream went to 1/4 video on the corner of my screen. I only sent TWO messages, but after sending it, it then got suspended. Please enhance your, i guess system.."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The App has good functioning but old features version. I decide to not use this App before and using GB Whatsapp (un-official App) because it contains modern features for example saving status, repost status, separating individual chats from group chats, posting status with 45secs and sharing of data with more than 200MB. Yet you burned my number from using un-official App, i am back please improve your features. I submitted my view."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"January 27,2024 I like the app, overall. I did notice however, in the latest update when using emojis, it causes the text input box to jump to the top top of the screen, making the interface really awkward and sometimes frustrating to use. I'd also like to see on option to mute a video call on loud speaker and suddenly need to mute the conversation temporarily. 84 people found this review helpful did you find this helpful?"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Mostly a great app. I love it and I use it all the time. The only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is because WhatsApp took away some of my very favourite avatar stickers, and a LOT of the new ones they bring in are either to weird to use, or not very good for me as they have a very narrow relevance ... one is even in a language I don't recognise! ... why put ANY words in avatar stickers anyway? It's very non-inclusive surely?"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Everything is working perfect but stop changing and moving all the features from one place to another designing is getting worse by every update. All the previous design were the best.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The screen freezes when I'm listening to a voice message. I have to turn off my phone and back on again. Really annoying! I'm an android user. Nearly all apple users I know have a problem where their speaker becomes suddenly low and they can barely hear. Other than that this app is really good! I find it convent enough for everyday use.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Can u add channels option in linked phn too???? Can you add some kind of....like auto cut video(using AI) in parts(in 30 seconds)??. So whenever i choose a video and want to put that video in status i don't have to choose the 30 sec then put that in status then again choose 30 sec then again put that.....because this kind of time taking so that sometimes people don't want to put video in status....so..um..i think it helps your users better in someway.

You should really fix this problem because the it is making the app hard to use for your customers. And I use it for school."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I cannot give WhatsApp a five star again because the updates are not necessary. No search option for status. Personal post or my status time is incorrect and changes anyhow. If possible let it have an interface that separates groups from personal chats. The HD feature is okay since WhatsApp reduces the quality of pictures and videos now.

"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"WhatsApp has been my go-to communication app for years. However, I've recently encountered a minor glitch. When my media visibility is turned off, attempting to save the same image twice from WhatsApp channel triggers an error stating ""WhatsApp has stopped."" Despite this hiccup, the app's overall performance is stellar. Additionally, I noticed that minimizing WhatsApp right after this issue and reopening allows direct access without fingerprint scanning even if you turned off the phone."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The former update is likely better than the now, why do you guys keep doing this? I don't think the new ""achieve"" setting is right. When ever I achieve a chat, when a message drops, the chat pops up again which can be annoying. I like it that it remains achieve until the owner of the account wills. Tried updating but it is isn't working, try to attend to this."

The QR scanner to transfer chats is literally the worst I've ever used. Any other app's scanner will pick up on the QR code instantly, but I can not get WhatsApp to read the QR code no matter what I do. No matter the lighting, the angle of the camera, the screen's brightness...whyy isn't there some kind of fallback option?"

This thing is so annoying and scary, please do something about this Whatsapp 🙏"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's rather sad that the developers don't pay attention to reviews but end up making unnecessary updates. By now whatsapp should have a comfirm button pop-up when it comes to accidental audio and video calls to touch sensitivity. Also groups in a community should be given the option to be archived instead of being stuck on the chat page. I believe we deserve more
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"And WhatsApp just got terrible. There were times when you call a person on WhatsApp, you get the ""calling"" prompt as an indicator that the person is offline. If the person were online, you'd see ""Ringing"". Guess what, whether online or offline, what is displayed on screen is ""Ringing"", leaving you with the assumption that the person is online, but doesn't want to pick up, whereas the person could be offline. I hate all these IRRELEVANT updates. Stop spoiling the good features on WhatsApp."

Fighting third party apps who modify and bring features that makes WhatsApp usage better is WRONG.

The right thing your management should have done is get to know what your competitors have and why people prefer them.

What's the fix for this? 3)Also multiple watch faces support WhatsApp complication but the unread notification count does not update once it has been read on the phone. We need to manually go to the watch app too to clear it off. 4) If I disable the watch app notifications i don't recieve notifications at all. Too buggy guys !

The most frustrating one is that voice messages stop playing when the proximity sensor is triggered (e.g., when putting the phone in pocket).

"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This chat messenger is good. But you really need to bring more features in it for more secure private chats. Say if I want to lock one conversation but don't want to hide. I should get notified and by unlocking it I should be able to see. But lock and hide isn't a good feature. It stops notification. We should be able to just lock the chat and it remains in the chat section. Hide should be a seperate feature. And turning off notifications should be seperate. It should be our choice what we want.

In some WhatsApp groups, there are people from different languages, when a message arrives we should be able to translate it by a simple click of a button."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app deserves five stars but I will give three stars too. Because an animated sticker stops moving shortly after using it.As a result, when sending stickers to people, there is a lot of confusion as to which is which sticker."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Loving the new bulleted list, dual account and other new recently added features, saves me the hassle of having to install two different accounts. However i think you should seperate group chats and conversations in different columns. I have so many busy groups and sometimes it is very hard to locate my conversations since both are bunched up in one column."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Before the update, I only see calling when someone's offline or unreadable. But after the update, it shows ringing, giving me the impression that the individual is online but ignoring the call. It's a little disappointing, though. A downgrade, if you ask me."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Won't vibrate notifications if you chose silent tones for notifications. This is stupid. Tried to get support only to get none and to check their help pages which don't cover the issue or bug they have.

Out of blue the application stopped workig with a following note ""whatsapp needs to be closed"" for three days i could not gain access to my number, any time i tried to ask for verification it kept telling me, "" we can not send the verification code now, try after one hour"" Again the same problem... Finally after so many years i decided to do away with whatsapp, what a pity."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When someone reacts to a post, it is displayed in the status bar as notification but when the app is opened, it doesn't show any notification. It should be changed, either there should not be any notification for reactions in the status bar or it should be there in the app also. Please take appropriate action. Edit: Further, when multiple files are posted, they get grouped together and then one cannot tell which ones have not been sent because tick marks are not there. Please fix this."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Since the update a few days ago, all messages that appear in the pop-up notification window are marked as Read even if I haven't seen them. I've missed a few messages because of this. Otherwise usually no problems."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I loved the WhatsApp untill they launched channel there. Channel is the totally waste thing I find here. WhatsApp's uniqueness is in feeling and having personal connection only there. Even when I do social detox, I only keep WhatsApp for emergency updates and uninstall all other apps. But now I feel WhatsApp is trying become like other social media channels and loosing it's uniqueness."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Hey whatsapp, The recent update in which the toggle switches for updates, calls etc were changed is really annoying.

"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The new update moving the status, chats and call bar down is terrible. The bar is blocking some chats and I can't swipe to change to tabs like I did previously, so I have to go to the bottom and tap it."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It can't hide chats. It's lock chat settings 3 dot option not showing.we can't use different passcode to locked chats than phone passcode. Mark Zuckerberg must improve the settings in this application. It doesn't has many features just like Gb whatsapp. Whatsapp didn't give opportunity to use gbwhatsapp for us. They must give opportunity to use it. This is the worst whatsapp I've ever seen. We can't save other's status and forward others status to our status in thid app. Please read this,Fix all"

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"For the most part I love this app, and it's my main app for messaging my friends. However, since Android 14 I've been having issues where some chats will start to come through as silent notifications meaning I'm not aware I have new messages unless I open the app. Very frustrating. Hopefully we can get some sort of fix soon. Resetting the app is only a temporary fix."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Yesterday I updated my WhatsApp but soon after the updated is finished, it was so so disheartened to see that all my chats have been vanished. I used to back up my chats on weekly basis. Even I triedto back up the chats but all in vain. This has made me to question and put the review here. All the chats were so important and their sudden disappearance has made me so disappointed by the latest update."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,If you can just separate personal chats from group chats then it'll be great. All the chats flooding a single section is not a good experience. The developers should kindly look at that. Otherwise this is a good app for messaging and it's also private.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I have been using WhatsApp for many years but now I have have started thinking for an alternative. The reason is that I am now fed up because of the notifications which I receive on each voice chat opening in groups. Also now it takes much longer to send even a picture.

Thank you."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I just updated it, and this may be the worst update from WhatsApp. I did not like this new update because of the location of the buttons. Everyone is complaining about it. I prefer the old form of WhatsApp. I hope that WhatsApp returns the old form, because the new update is simply very annoying And harmful to the eyes !!!"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"WhatsApp has been incredible in the past but now I am stuck with WhatsApp account in an old phone I wish to get rid of. Unfortunately I can't do that since I keep getting the error in the new phone ""You need the official WhatsApp to login"" whenever I try to setup my WhatsApp account. This is despite using the official WhatsApp in both old and new phone. It's really frustrating that despite contacting WhatsApp I don't get any feedback."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"New update sucks. The notifications don't show the messages even when the phone is locked like they used to. Now they just say ""WhatsApp"" without showing any message when the phone is locked. Also, the emoji icon sometimes disappears by itself. This literally just happened to me less than a minute before I typed this review. It's so annoying when that happens."

But on my WhatsApp business, I get to see status updates from the time my phone was turned off till the current time. This is really annoying and WhatsApp needs to fix this."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The updates to the UI are really annoying. I like the simple classic-Whatsapp feel. The navigation panel at the bottom is an eyesore.

However, with the latest update, encountered a significant issue. I'm unable to view status updates, which has hindered my ability to engage with my contacts in the same way I used to. Additionally, I'm not a fan of the recent changes in the latest version. The interface feels less intuitive, and some features have been moved around, causing some confusion.my WHATSAPP Why not oppen"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Previous UI allowed us to navigate/transition from chats to status (update) without tapping on status(update). This new UI isn't possible to do that. Please, check for us. Also, should the channels be compulsory?"

In 1st account all contacts were available, but in 2nd account 0 contacts was showed. For this reason I uninstall and reinstall installed the newest version of app , and then my all contacts are deleted. Fix this bugs."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This is a very good application for chatting. But I gave 2 stars because whenever I call my friend it repeating my voice and that is very disturbing and irritating. When I send some photos by clicking them by the WhatsApp camera itself and if internet stops working the photos are not sent because internet was interrupted. If I try to resend it pops the message saying that the device donot have the file in storage and then I have to click the photos again. I think Whatsapp should improve these.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The voice note feature has been acting up a lot. My grandmother is paraplegic, so you can imagine that voice notes are incredibly useful. However, playing the things has become a nightmare of note. As soon as I hit play, my screen is switched off, then on, then off all while the audio being played varies in volume from the loudest to not even being audible. This never used to happen before the channels update."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This new ""Select all"" feature is the most annoying upgrade. First off, its positioning in the menu is terrible and confusing. I want to select ""Mark as read"", but I end up selecting the wrong menu ""Select all"". Secondly, how often does a person need to select all chats?! Not too often, extremely once in a while if there's ever a need to. This should be removed from the publicly available menu when selecting a chat. It's giving a ceaselessly frustrating and annoying experience!!!"

OG Watsap GB whatsapp ,I will always miss these beautiful Apps, this Watsap messager after viewing someone's status it disappears , people sends message and easily can delete for though it would be used as evidence in some cases that the person was hurrsing you.Am not happy at all because of blocking other whatsapp and we remain with this fake one 😭😭😭😭😭"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Functionality of the WhatsApp is great. But why changing the UI ?? Simple but elegant UI of WhatsApp was one of the main things that attracted me as a first time social media user 4 years ago. But now it's just a mess and don't have that charm that I loved.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"WhatsApp is a really nice app, great for texting, calling, etc. I was also very happy with the recent update that you can send specific people the same photo/video instead of having to share it to different people one at a time. I was also very happy to see we can now hude our stories from certain people! But I sometimes have a problem with replying to photos and I have the latest version of Whatsapp and it still doesn't work. I hope the bug gets fixed. Other than that, great app!"

I repeatedly have to request to be unblocked and I'm restored every time...only to be blocked again before I can even send a single message. Waste of my time"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Thanks for including the lock chat feature it's really helpful. But am not with the idea of channels it should at least have options if i want to be seeing the channels or not. And the option for transferring chats is giving me a hard time so it would be better to use a different method of transferring chats rather than turning on the location.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app, I'm not sure why a messaging and phone calling app has ""updates,"" but that's not affecting me at all, so if people like it, that's cool. BUT I cant edit my stories without watching every single one. Bring back the feature where I could view my story list and be able to delete them without having to watch it... like before. 10-17-23 Edit: They fixed the problem and I now have what I asked. Thank you"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,worst since you guys started changing feautures WhatsApp has been worst. I find it hard to press the read more button on status. even now videos don't play on status even after loading I'll only be hearing the sound but it won't show.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to be such a good app! Now there just doesn't seem to be any real care with it! Screen freezes whenever I try to play an audio message. Have to close the screen completely then restart the app. I've done everything humanly possible to rectify it but to no avail. With all the tech out there, it's easy just to switch to another app. Sort it out whatsapp!!!"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,A hate that the archive files are now on the top. I preferred it at the very end of the chats. Also when I mute someone's story I want it to be completely hidden. There is no point in the mute feature if you can just scroll down and find them. I prefer it to be completely hidden. Edit: they hid the mute stories which is great. Suggest a feature: what if we are able to control the time for which someone's status appears on our screen? Because some of us are slow readers.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I don't know what happened with my WhatsApp but whenever I upload/share videos or photos in status and chats the quality of both the videos and photos gets poor which I find it an issue because others don't face this problem.Please check out on this. Thank you
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The old version was better. I'm particularly pissed about the ""status"" section. Firstly, it gets all jumbled up as soon as you start to follow channels. My regular updates moved from vertical position to the horizontal format and the rest of the space is filled with all the channels, the reverse would have been a lot better. Secondly, the ""search"" option is removed and now I have to painstakingly scroll through every update till I find the status I want to see. It's ridiculous"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's actually a good app, but the latest version has some issues. The timeline that shows when the person has lastly been online is usually incorrect and doesn't show when they actually are online. Many messages are delayed and don't get sent soon enough. Please do something about it. Thank you. Update: the issue is unfortunately still present in the newest version."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am really not comfortable with the recent upgrade. It makes status really stressful for me. My statuses used to cascade vertically but now it doesn't. I can't easily select statuses to delete. I used to see the highlights of other's statuses before I viewed them, but now the highlight is no more, but I only see their profile pictures instead. Why channels, please? I seriously disagree with channels. Can it be done in a way where one can turn it off? These channels are really really useless..."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is great in many ways, what I like about it is the fact that you can send lengthy videos and audios, very unique. One thing I would like for you guys to update is the editing of the status post, because all I see when clicking the 3 vertical dots is you either can ""forward"" or ""Delete"" I would like it to have edit as well so I can edit and write a caption below it just in case I missed it the first time, that's the only update I'd love to see. Other than that, the app is spectacular!!"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Whenever I want to post a long video on status it is difficult to share it into shorter ones of 30 seconds each without leaving out any part of the video. It will be easier if I just have to select the video and it automatically shares itself in a way that each part follows the previous... It's really stressful to post multiple times and to make it continue from where the previous video stopped. Please do something about it.

I have mailed 100 times . No proper resulation to my query at all . If keep doing this whatsapp will loose customers .
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Whatsapp has been generally very useful and user-friendly. But the recent update on the status bar makes it difficult to view and impossible to search for status updates. I think it would be better to let the user decide between a vertical or horizontal update/status layout. This horizontal arrangement makes the whole experience less interesting. Plus, I'm not really feeling the idea of channels. I'd like the option of turning it off when I want."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am extremely dissatisfied with the latest upgrade of the WhatsApp app. The changes made to the status feature have made it incredibly inconvenient to view statuses, unlike before. Previously, it was easy to scroll through and view the status updates of my contacts effortlessly. However, the new version has made the whole experience clunky and less user-friendly. It's frustrating and time-consuming to navigate through the statuses, hindering the overall user experience."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Each update is ruining the app, still it was fine, but now it takes time to send even a single image (no issue with my internet), even longer videos are sent easily but a single image stays stuck at 50% for quite some time, and when it is finally sent, the confirmation sound rings twice. Kindly fix this issue, it's a pain to send images during chat. If it's fixed, i will gladly raise the rating to 4 stars."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's quite a good App. Would really appreciate it if 'Communities' am part of can be archived. I don know whether it's a bug or what but I can't seem to be able to archive. Also, it would be nice to be able to view emojies as I paste them on conversations, as each time I want to send one, the dialogue box goes behind the stickers box instead of both, the emojies and stickers box and the dialogue box appearing."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Whenever I post statuses, it gets blurry, especially my video. If I may add a caption to the video itself after posting it, I can hardly see the word, and the quality gets poor. I thought it was my phone and recently I changed phones and it's the same thing happening. I heard other people saying the same thing, so I am sure it's not just me experiencing this kind of mess. Please fix it because it is frustrating to be using the status feature, and things are looking blurry."

The status is now appearing in a packed horizontal manner and I cannot even see the last update a person made, only their profile picture, as if that was not enough, the search feature for statuses is not there. It's really frustrating! If you can exchange channels and status update functionality, it'd be more beautiful and easy to use. The last update was better! 😥"

"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'll rate it 5 stars if you guys manage to create a separate section for group chat and personal chat, and give advantage for user to categorise the chat base on user's preferences. Why? Coz this make user easy to foreseen the whole picture of their chat history and easy for them to navigate their preferred chat to read. I understand, there are easy way to search a chat but people have this problem call short-term memory and it is really frustrating especially when the chats are unorganised."

Viewing someone's status means status would be saved in your phone which I don't need at all 2. The chats and group chats stays in one column which is not preferable if you are in so many groups and you aren't both"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been using Whatsapp for years It's an excellent app. Option of status reaction is good but still I feel like reactions of status should appear on ""My status"" of other person instead of individual chats to make sure not to disturb them. I hope you'll consider my suggestion."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app should remember the last viewed message from unread messages in a chat, i.e., if there are 50 unread messages in a chat and the user opens & reads till 20 unread messages and closes the chat. Then again, if he opens chat,it should display 30 unread messages, instead of pointing at the latest message and pointer should be at 30th unread messages. Secondly there should be an option of seeing starred messages per Group. Currently starred messages is shown for all chats & groups together."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I've always liked using this app because of how simple it is but the idea that you need a password to restore your chat history is just ridiculous. You cannot even change this password if you're logged out of WhatsApp once. Utterly disappointed

Additionally, implementing an edit option for status updates within a 15-minute ,as available in chats ,would provide users with greater flexibility and control over their content."

Why are there channels and why it asks me to upload my status to facebook wth. Whatsapp team should reconsider what they are doing and just keep this app simple. Also instead of adding stupid social media function try adding feature where i can type message and select when and where this msg shoild be send."

Because we often converse through Whatsapp for official things too. So when we get reminded of work related things in the evng or night time, it won't be appropriate to text then. If we have a feature to schedule the messages for a particular time, if it sends automatically we can sleep peacefully. It ll be super helpful for wishing for birthdays as well 😄"

WhatsApp gave me no other choice but to give a bad review of this app. This app has failed me a few times. The team should be responsible for the errors"

"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I suggest an extra option under status privacy where you can save a particular group of contacts and there will be no need to always select contacts afresh when you want to change the target group
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I am sorry but new update interface is a burden. I often miss touch with cellphone menu. If possible could you just hide it? Since I am the type which is not using status and communities at my WA.

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,All the new updates are just worse. The changes in the layout are not at all comfortable. Also glitches need to be fixed. It's getting hard to use WhatsApp this way.

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My account kept being frozen and marked as spam when I would try to make a group chat for friends. This is ridiculous and shouldn't be this difficult when I repeatedly verify my phone number. What a piece if garbage this app is.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Bring back the old interface! Or at least make that bar and icons smaller, and leave it at the top as it was not bottom!.. bar rn just takes too much of the screen. Also if we have a tab for communities then just have communities only in there rather than flooding individual chats tab?"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is good but the problem is the groups and private chats in one tab is too clustered. If only WhatsApp can separate the group chats and private chats, it'd very easier to see and access ones private chat."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The recent update removed the swipe to navigate to status and calls by moving the icons below. Making this as a button only is not an usability friendly move.

Please swap places for the two features ( let status stay the way it was and let channels be the ones in a long file pleaseeeee) if not other apps would take over 2.

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ever since Facebook took ownership, WhatsApp sucks. There are some ""proprietary"" folders created for storing certain content, such as saving images from FB. It gives me less confidence of where my data truly resides. Additionally, I have been getting numerous of strangers pinged me via WhatsApp, this never used to happen before. It sucks but it's still better than Facebook and other social media channels. Also, I am required to keep up with updates that FB deems necessary."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's great to have an update, it's even better to see upgrades such as channels being introduced. But it's equally frustrating how abruptly the status page was changed. The horizontal line-up is a total mess. If you could perhaps have it made like the previous ones, aligned vertically and having the channels page on its own screen it'd be much easier for us. Include the search button on statuses as well and remove the profile pictures on them completely!... From a very disgruntled user😕"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,great app. but I suggest to add some features: 1. If I see someone's status first and they send it to me via whatsapp then the media doesn't come to the gallery. Plz fix this 2. Deletion of chat history from date 1 to date 2. Custom deletion. Like we can do in YouTube.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The new update is impractical. I can no longer select multiple status updates to either delete or share to FB. Now all my updates are automatically sent to FB or none at all when I would ordinarily select one or two at a time. We really should have an option as to whether or not we want to see the channels bar and at what point. I can no longer blur my background during a WA call. It makes no sense to take that away. It also doesn't make sense that I can blur on my android but not on my IOS.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Please why are video and audio calls registered in that manner in chats, its useless, if you try viewing it, it just calls the person back. What if i want to check the time the person called without having to call them back. I have also have noticed that the vibration setting for notifications is the same, be it default, long and short. The only option working is when the vibration on off. What is going on with WhatsApp, the more upgrade, the more annoying the app is. Sort this out."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The update of adding channels of some random celebrities is such a breach of privacy. WhatsApp was the only app used for interpersonal and private conversations. But now it is spammed by these suggestions of adding random channels.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"near perfect, but I experienced 2 complaint. first, extend the status duration for videos.

However, when new video comes in, the app does not wake the lockscreen. I have to manually wake the always on display, then I can see who's calling. Tried various notification settings but still doesn't work. On top of that the video/audio quality during calls are subpar in comparison to other apps, always have to wait for audio to catch up even in high speed Wifi. Annoying."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Please try to add a feature in which user can put the app on offline mode in which you can be connected to the internet but WhatsApp will be offline. In this way you can avoid msg or calls from anyone and still can work on other apps in the phone.

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app has increasing issues since I've been using it. The most recent is the forced combining of groups from the same org into ""communities"" which adds even more steps to get to the chats you actually use and combines all of the ""members"" lists into one. I can see having this as an option on the user's end, but forcing it is wildly inconvenient and prevents me from having my most frequently used chats immediately accessible."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So many bugs! If I i want to share or forward several photos, some aren't sent. If I want to edit a photo before sending by resizing or adding a text it will modify another photo other than the one I i wished to edit. When making a call, the last call doesn't appear on call logs immediately, you have to close and reopen the app. The updated status tab is very annoying to use especially that the search icon has disappeared."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is very good but the latest update that shifted the chats, updates and calls section to the bottom wasn't good it is better to shift it back to the top. Please make the way it was before, that is the best design for WhatsApp."

The previous versions didn't have this issue and were perfect. If this feature was intended then I suggest you to create a different option for stickers, don't combine it with photos, it's annoying."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Nice and very useful. But the phone's memory it occupies increases with each new update. Automatic download of videos in statuses should be disabled because one may have limited data and as a result it may get exhausted. I mean videos in statuses should not preload by themselves unless the user views them. Why does my status page go horizontal when I follow a channel? It should remain vertical or instead a separate page should be provided for channels please.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Hi, Whatsapp Team. I have been using Whatsapp for a long time and it was the best messaging app due to its simplicity and intuitive design. With the Channels update, there is no way to turn on or off the channels feature.

I understand that some users may like these channels, but give us the option to turn it on or off at least! Thanks."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"As an avid user of WhatsApp, I find the quality of the status feature to be disappointingly poor. Despite its popularity, the resolution of images and videos uploaded as statuses is often compromised, resulting in blurry or pixelated content. This undermines the purpose of sharing moments with friends and family, as the visual appeal is lost in the subpar quality. Improved resolution and optimization are imperative to enhance user experience."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Please bring back the navigation style to slide side to side from chats to statuses and call log. It's inconvenient having to select at the bottom of the screen. Navigation through the app was fine as it was!!!
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What the f, I'm usin WhatsApp for many years, why the heck you guys changing ui without any needs, you just pull down the chat, status bars into down, but why the f? It's annoying coz I'm almost have the muscle memory for years, It happens in insta often but now you started to do in WhatsApp too? Insane!! I won't change the 1 star if you continue this"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very bad support from WhatsApp Team, they can't solve a simple issue, I am contacting them from yesterday with no help. I am not able to get verification code via calls or SMS, Tried everything but getting error that unable to call on this number."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new updated looks sucks, I can't swipe from chats to status, I can't tell when someone isn't online when am calling because it keeps showing ringing, it's meant to show calling then ringing when the person phone starts ringing, app became really bad"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,You introduce chanel feature but you had merged with status. Now if we subscribe the chanel then status goes horizontally which is not good. You need to give separate tab for channel. Other than that there are lots of suggestions (user friendly).
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"One of the worst updates in WhatsApp... The previous version having all the tabs above was the best. Another thing I hate is the nonsense ""Community"" and ""channels combined with status"". The recent display of status plus the dp of the sender is annoying."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,New channels features need to be hidden. Saving to cloud should be an option. Tracking network usage should also be an option. All these features that are being added should have an option to be turned off. What'sapp is an internet messaging app. That is all it has to be. Everything they are adding is already available on other Meta platforms.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'd have given it a five star rating except for the fact that when I post an HD format video on my status that I download from TikTok the quality gets reduced when it's posted and it's kinda weird since my viewers complain about the quality on my status Kindly help fix this, everything else is really good about this app"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great messaging app and I'm glad that it has a dark mode, but I would like to have a feature that allows us to choose the colour of the text boxes."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love it, EXCEPT that it frequently loses messages that are only a few days old. I've researched it and cannot determine a reason. I've reinstalled several times. This has been happening over two or more years. My phone is very reliable and never more than 2 years old. My OS version is always up to date. My storage space is always adequate. WhatsUp??"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love WhatsApp and can safely say it's my favourite app. I'm usually connected to Wi-Fi making it cost-effective and easy to send messages and also images and photos. I love that you can set up group chats. and my friends and family and other parents at school find this so handy.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Can you guys fix the issue with the voice notes. When I'm recording VNs, the UI changes from the waves that tracks your voice to just 'Recording' and everything said at this point isn't recorded. When there's a playback, you'll notice the obvious gap in the message you're attempting to pass across and it is incredibly frustrating to say the least."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Please can you guys work on uploading quality on status upload, I will try uploading a media with top quality after uploading it, the video or picture will look like it was made in 90s..... You guys keep rolling out updates and not really working on the main problem users are facing."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"NOT WORKING. So both me and friend have WhatApp but instead of sending a msg to eachother all it lets us do is send app invites via SMS. We both ALREADY have the app downloaded. How dumb this app is. Its a cinch with Signal and Session. With what tf is up Whatsapp your urse, it's nonsense."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app consumes so much memory, it's yet lessen the quality of pics/videos. The statuses of friends that user has seen should not be stored, tho. Personally, the updated features are not so important, like channels. Please modify so user can hide the channel recommendation. Most of people use this app only for communication, not so much for entertaining."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Damn it took a while but WhatsApp's finally here for wear os. Everything's good and all except the photos. We can't see the photos properly. So can you guys add a full screen mode to view photos properly. Also in good quality. That'd be much appreciated. The syncing time is also quite long. Lowering it would also be a great improvement.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,On iphone i can swipe right on any message to view message info. Why can't i do the same on android. Why does it have to be a 3 step process? Long tap on a message then in the top right corner press the three dots and then press on info. Huh? Bring the swipe right feature to android please.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It has an astounding capability of turning your 24 hours of the day unproductive which otherwise could have been used for gaining knowledge. PS- Don't even get me started about forced conversations and lousy long forwarded messages.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Just to give a suggestion, please make a separation between private chat and group chat to make searching easier. Too many updates but never thought about this before, making this app lag behind other app. So please make it possible ASAP."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Experiencing an issue while sending photos by clicking them directly via WhatsApp: Whenever I send a picture, instead of continuing in the same chat, I am forced to exit the chat and it redirects me to the home screen of WhatsApp containing all my contacts. Kindly fix this problem, as it is problematic when I send many pictures at once in a specified order. But on the whole, it is a great app @"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I dont like the interface of the new update were every options like chats,updates and calls has been moved to the bottom. Please bring those options to appear on top again instead of bottom."

Whether the person's data is turned off or on . Please update this. When other's data is off it must be show ""Calling"" while calling. When the other's data on it must be show ""Ringing"" while calling."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is great! I suggest a select option where users can select a number of people they want to remove from a group and take them out at once instead of removing one after the other, or better still an option where the admin or creator of the group can delete the group and it reflects on members phone just like when a message is deleted. Also, can you bring back the vertical status view, I get that you want to accommodate the channels, but you can create a separate section for channels."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm giving 4 star to this app,this app features are very good but problem is very less security there are so many chance to steal the information by linked device feature or fake websites.we need a feature for hide some private chats and special theme colour features."

HOWEVER this new update sucks. why is everything at the bottom for Samsung suddenly????? it's been at the top for over 5 years and suddenly they thought it's a good idea to bring it to the bottom? I HATE IT, please bring it back to normal😶"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There is no need to show the lock chat icon in interface just secure the perticular person chat and when it is necessary to open the chat box for the perticular person,the security is needed. And it will be user friendly."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great. I like the two account systems on this app. However, I recommend for the separation of private chats from group chats. I mean there should be different colon for each."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The recent update whereby status changed to updates is so very unwelcome. Not sure what the developers hoped to achieve. It's no longer possible to search and check statuses. One now has to scroll through it all; which I don't bother to do. This means important information (contacts' birthdays and events) I could get before is now missed!! There's now a section for channels, which is irrelevant to me! Please bring back the search button; even if you want to name it updates."

It's annoying when I can't access the particular group. Why in the world does your new update change WhatsApp change message? Why also did you switch the updates nav bar position from top to bottom 🤦‍♀️"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been encountering a critical and persistent bug on my Galaxy Z Fold5. Despite using the latest version, the app always crashes whenever I attempt to send a message, regardless of its content. Attempts to clear the cache have been futile, rendering the app useless for nearly a month. WhatsApp Support seems to close support requests automatically after one or two automated replies. And I can't send add'l details to the Support Bot, because - surprise! - the app crashes when sending messages."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I gave it 3 stars because the recent update doesn't show time for everything(time a message was sent, last seen time, time a person called etc) it's really boring. Add the time on your next update, it's very important."

The constant changes in the interface make it difficult to navigate, and the app's insistence on sharing more data than ever raises serious privacy red flags.

The status/updates section is now wack, I prefer the vertical look over the horizontal layout, and being able to sort of get a preview of the status before clicking. Etc. It would have been much better if status/updates and channels had separate sections, that way it would go back to having that iconic horizontal layout. And channels would be there for... Whoever needs it."

It's interrupted searching for individual statuses (so one literally has to look for them manually 😥 Secondly, when I update my status and want to forward or delete more than one update or all of them, it just accepts one at a time. That's sort of a downgrade, not an update. Please work on these"

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Weird update and quite a dismal looking UI with all the options falling down at the bottom. Maintain the originality and the simplicity.

Anyway it really enhances my self belief, i don't like talking as much to be honest. On the other hand i would still like to make sure it is genuenly used, i just get astonished some times by how fast of mature replies i got from friends. Anyway i know i could use more of this app and u hope it keeps me posted or in other words stays running on my phone. Thanks"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app, but I think the update we need is for the archived messages to be hidden from the main page, completely hidden, I don't want to feel the urge to click it because I see messages piling up there."

I can no longer swipe left or right to view updates and phonecalls, instead I now have to tap the bottom of my screen (which used to be the top.)

Stop trying to improve your app, you're only making it worse."

I'm receiving a bunch of mistake calls from my parents all day long because of that. Can't move the calls etc. pane to the upper part of screen. Some idiot designed new interface. 2. If you log in WhatsApp at your old phone, it does not upload chats history from the cloud drive. And then WA rewrites the history on the drive. 2 years of chats just gone."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's frustrating combining chats from group and from individual in on same line. Please at least it should be separated. And the dissappearing message doesn't make sense. It's not supposed to be on automatically. All my messages disappeared under a day no history.

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I totally agree that using other versions of whatsapp isn't fair to the real developers, but you should understand that we use the other versions because of the flexibility and numerous features we get from it. Instead of forcing us out of the other versions while don't you focus the energy making whatsapp more flexible for us"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This update was totally unnecessary and is really annoying and the UI is disorganised. You practically took away our free will when it comes to searching for status updates. It would be better if we were given the option to hide/mute channels. Also, an update in which 'edited' and 'you deleted a message' prompts are only visible to the person who performed these actions will be better appreciated."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app was so good until the latest update. The channels option is unnecessary, not everyone wants to be in social media in that way . And it screwed up the app. I can't send videos anymore, it just stopped working properly and theirs also a big in some chats and groups. They just don't work properly. Make it optional for people to have the option of viewing channels or make a specific tan for it ."

But either make it customised or do it like this.....Calls | Updates [Chat • Groups] Channels | Community...........Convenient + symmetrical.....and anyway 1. chats is essence of WhatsApp so it should be in centre. 2.

Calls as it is since the origin of mobiles, to the extreme left."

During all conversations the connection is continuously dropping after about 30 seconds of for upwards of 20 seconds, showing on-screen, poor connection, reconnecting, followed by beeps and restoration of service for another few seconds.

"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've had a great time using WhatsApp over the years however I know these suggestions below will help better my experience; 1. Could you add a ""1-month message timer"" to various disappearing timer alternatives? For me, the 7 day timer is quite short and the 90day timer is too long as well, a monthly timer would really help bridge that gap. 2. Aside voice note for which speed preferences are added, could you introduce the same for all audio files? Thank you"

I would like that feature on android too because it really is convenient for me to simply swipe left and see rather than hold on it, then click info which kinda feels inconvenient especially when you're using it in one hand. I would appreciate it if you guys can add this feature to android. Thank you."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,WhatsApp has been a great part of my communication tools. Recently I noticed that my WhatsApp doesn't send me notifications for new messages and I have to Open my app to get to know there's a new message. Checked all my phone settings and they are all in order.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Search doesn't work. I reached out to WhatsApp's support which is completely worthless. When I go to any chat (whether with 1 person, 10 or 100) and I type a word in the search box that I'm certain that appears in the chat, and press enter or the up arrow, nothing happens. Only searching from the main homepage works, but that searches in all the groups, rather than in a specific one. I've noticed this in the last week or so, since I upgraded to Android 14. Google Pixel 7 Pro."

Except that loud speaker in voice calls needs to be louder, but can't find any settings for increasing the loud speaker volume. 4 stars would be 5 stars if i could get that sorted. Edit - PS, forgot to mention - in regular phone calls on my phone, there's no problem with volume of loud speaker, so must be a WhatsApp issue."

Earlier it had a feature to clear the stickers that are sent. Now it's not there. That option was a good one to manage storage because we don't want to delete messages or photos or anything but stickers are just for that moment. So please bring that feature back so that i could get more space in my phone

(2) Remove the channels features. No one likes it. It's very annoying. (3) Increase the time duration in which the sent message can be edited. (4) Add cloud storage.

It's very annoying!!! Some of the messaging features are a bit wacky in their design, but they work well enough. I don't use this ap often, only when I'm asked to use it for work or family so I wouldn't describe myself as a daily user."

Options of chat, voice and video calls are good to communicate with people. However, I would like to highlight that people can take screenshots without the permission of a caller in video calling which is not always an acceptable thing. Please add some security feature so that people would not be able to screenshot things in video calling. This is really important as one of the security feature."

Since you created an independent window for communities, why is it different this time around when you try to introduce channels as a new feature on whatsapp. Additionally, I don't subscribe to the idea of deleting the search bar for statuses, it makes the experience less interesting. Finally, why are statuses now displaying horizontally and no longer in a vertical layout?"

It's file sharing is amazing (to the level of discord - although if you're looking for something better choose telegram) but what I'm looking for is more customisation ( e.g.different char bubble colours different). For security it's okay; you don't get many unknown message requests appart from job offers. Also when the app is locked, when unlocking, you should have the option to use fingerprint OR pin. Overall it's a great app, just a few cons."

Whatsapp technical team the new update is poor and how you can update application without my permission as i Didn't allow it. It's not your private property to uodate the application on behalf of me. If it happen again i will uninstall the application and will report it too.

My challenge is that I don't get notifications on calls at real time unless I open the app before I see messages coming in, missed calls also.

Also, the new channels feature complicates things. Before, viewing statuses was simple. Now, with channels mixed in, it's confusing. If channels are necessary, it would be better to separate them onto a different page, preserving the original status feature. I miss the old, straightforward WhatsApp."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"""Status Option"" is much important than channels. Knowing peoples statuses was the reason for developing WhatsApp this option should be vertical and take all the place of the ""updates"" and the channels options must be in circles in and single horizontal line as it was an additional and not so important as we already view the channels on other platforms and also it never loads by itself. The original settings were easy and reliable. Now, If I post status and then update settings, it doesn't work."

Now we have to keep scrolling to see our contact's status updates."

One this thought is that it would be nice to be able to have that 'zoom out blur' feature in the profile picture on iOS added to Android and more. It would also be great if you could edit polls as well. Thank you Facebook!

"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I use WhatsApp for many years without any issue, however, I miss one feature and I would like to share it with the team. I really miss timer for sending the message. Sometimes great ideas come in the night, but disturbing sleep of others not the best way and you may be not understood. For example, certain messages I would like to be delivered around 10am, so i just set the time and date for the message. That would ease my mind 100%. Thanks."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm encountering soooo many problems with the app ... Firstly, it blocked my account due to ""spam"" but last i checked, my account didn't violate any WhatsApp guidelines Secondly it keeps telling me to download the ""official"" app...but won't let me log in once I do... I think I have downloaded the app over 50 times this past day, even reset my phone, still to no avail"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Experiencing an issue while sending photos by clicking them directly via WhatsApp: Whenever I send a picture, instead of continuing in the same chat, I am forced to exit the chat and it redirects me to the home screen of WhatsApp containing all my contacts. Kindly fix this problem, as it is problematic when I send many pictures at once in a specified order. But on the whole, it is a great app. 👍"

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Local back-up issue Unable to do local back-up anymore. App keeps crashing everytime I go to App settings → chat → chat backup. Same happens with whatsapp business as well
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"In Android 13, i lost my local chat backup and media when i accedentally uninstalled WhatsApp. I only have local backup and i lost my entire chat history. Dear WhatsApp please use the old way(storing chat and files in WhatsApp folder on internal storage, not inside Android/media/com.whatsapp)."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Unusable! Over the last few days my what's app has become unusable. I am no longer receiving notifications and whenever I send a message the app force closes and this happens every time I attempt to send a message. After a few attempts I have to restart my phone to be able to access what's app at all. Looking online it seems to be due to the latest Google pixel update.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"New update is terrible. The interface is quite disappointing, we want it to rollback to the previous version."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My phone has an amazing camera however picture quality is horrible horrible horrible when I upload pictures and videos. Worst than chinese phones. Apparently this is a common issue with all new samsung and iphone phones but WhatsApp has failed to fix it
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After this update I can't even open my WhatsApp anymore, it just gives me the logo and nothing else. I have tried to restart my phone & clear the app cache but yet didn't work. Kindly fix this problem! Thanks."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Whenever I launch the app for the very first time in a day, many a times the dialog ""Backing up messages - Please wait for a moment..."" is being displayed, and I'm unable to use the app for some minutes until the local backup is created. This is really annoying, especially when you want to text/call someone immediately via WhatsApp - they could try to take the backup asynchronously while enabling the customers to keep using the application when the backup is getting created in the background."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Not that bad but it has stopped working in my phone it keeps on saying this account is not allowed to use this whatsApp, so right now it is not working at all...... ....maybe there is something you can dobecause this whatsApp i downloaded it yestérday, then today......it has stopped....where can that happen......? I think this app it chooses where to work in. This what it will get only one * star"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Nice app but recently you've been suspending my account quite often and later claiming that it was flagged down accidentally.That's not even the main issue.So now I'm stuck from logging back into my account because of the error message ""You need the official app to log in"" despite following your instructions again and again 🤦 This is so frustrating 😪"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's very unfortunate that people don't like to be corrected, if for nothing, half of the whatsapp development group should be laid off, the 3rd party version of what'sapp is more advanced and developed than this trash, instead of your team to learn, you're busy blocking people"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Very intuitive design and fluid access. The addition of channel to me is just unnecessary. WhatsApp we've come to know is for texting and communication, please don't make it more like a Facebook. We already have Facebook or Instagram to follow Pages. Moreover, the channels makes it difficult to scroll through statuses and making me less likely to view the status of my contacts."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I gave it 4 stars, but it deserves 5 stars. So I will give it 5 full stars if you add an extra tab (heading) for group chats so that individual chats are separated from group chats. I love that you put the headers at the bottom."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is great, look forward to using this app all the time. I'm not up into all the new tech stuff but I was given this great opportunity to work with you and make more money and easier to change my life for the better. That alone makes me very greatful Thank you all. GB."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Trying to pass your chats to another device it deletes everything even if u back-up everything and u have to start from scratch. It's very annoying. And you could only go in with a number, unlike other apps that you can go in with an email, phone numbers constantly could change and it's just difficult to stay with everything without losing it if you decide to change Whatsapp to another device. (Not just linking it temporarily, I mean officially)."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I would love the option to save status and I would also love the option to post longer videos and also have the option to still see messages and status if deleted. It's 2024 please to step it up and make the app more fun and interesting.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The latest interface so terrible, why everything below? Its hard to reach especially when the option to swipe to status just doesn't exist anymore... Why community channel even exist? Whatsapp isn't Instagram, status (updates) should be display from up to down not left to right like Instagram story... The difference what make its better. So far my experience is horrible, i hope you keep the old design"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is a chat app that I use a lot, it's so popular in Brazil, but I had bought a Xiamo redime note 12, and Whatsapp doesn't work, I open and it closes, I have already searched, so many ways to solve, this trouble , But nothing had worked, please help me someone😭😭"

"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Everything is fine but the call quality is not very good. Audio calls are pretty good but video calls are pretty bad. I hope the video call quality will be improved.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I gave two stars because of it horrible notification alignment especially for lower version phones, the pop up message is no longer available, which making it untimely to attend customers alert🚨🚨 messages. This isn't right, and custom notification feature is not working, when set it, it shows no effect. Fix your notification and allow pop up message feature in all devices."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The app is nice on its own but the problem with this WhatsApp is that the group is not separated 😭💔 from the main chats 😞 Had it been they are separated I would have given it five stars ⭐. So am pleading with the developer of this app to give this a listen 👂 hear it will help to improve your app Thanks 👍
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"whatsapp srsly needs to to fix its connection issues. its not my mobile data, or my wifi. its causing way too many issues at this point with trying to send and receive messages as well as calls, and its always at the worst of times! and once it finally catches up, every notification explodes at once! theres been emergencies and ive missed them because of this!"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My WhatsApp suddenly logged out and I'm unable to find the solution and I'm not even able to login my account on another device. I have a lot of work through my WhatsApp account but I'm unable to do due to this issue! I'm requesting to help me to get out of this situation asap.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Well is fun and all of that. Very exciting and secured but that doesn't sound like something new to me. What we need is channels we can use to download video games, movie and a whole lot more."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I think its high time, you provide Save button for statuses. We can't be downloading Save statuses app just because we wanna save and repost a friend's picture or story. Please input that button, thank you And also, be now, we should be able to change the theme of our whatsapp. Why all this green and black I'm seeing. My eyes are dead from it.. Do better, thank you Also, why is it hard to press Read more on statuses. That's weird, pls look at the error. Instead the message button keeps popping"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What is the meaning of this na, if I send a sticker or if I want to send 2 stickers, I'll send one first and instead of sending the second one immediately, the sticker page will reload and I'll start from beginning to start scrolling again to get to the second sticker, please if this is new update, change it beck to the way it was before cos this is stressful."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've used whatsapp before but now it won't verify my number. (the same one I used when I used the app the first time) I've retried sending the verification for almost a week, nothing changes. The in-app help is of no use. Wouldn't recommend at all."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"got a problem where when I opened WhatsApp, it said ""This account is not allowed to use WhatsApp due to spam"". I hadn't violated any terms of service of WhatsApp so I requested a review and a day later, I open it again and it said that WhatsApp had accidentally flagged my account and that I could use WhatsApp again. Relieved, I logged in again only for the same problem to appear again. I am unable to chat to my friends and family and I am not happy. PLEASE FIX THIS GLITCH 😭"

"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"very good app for communicating. i dont have any complaint about the quality of chats, calls or even privacy. but i'd be happy if they could add some customization options, like different colors and themes. many people use third party mod versions for cute themes which are really dangerous for private data. i think it'd be really great and popular if colors and themes could be added to original whatsapp"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Horrible app and need to be able to hide mobile number for privacy and personal security. Perhaps introduce a user name instead of personal contact details. Updated review : tried to back up chats before moving to new phone. Backup function does not work. Needs to be a app you can log into from other devices Without losing chat history
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Please include save option for document files just like IOS version and also we need Crop tools for sending video please. Not only for images. We need crop tools for video also. Just like on iphone devices.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Not like it was. I miss so many messages since my version of Android no longer gets pop-up notifications. 6 month old Samsung and latest software update. The camera is really bad and don't even bother doing video calls with WhatsApp anymore.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Always has been the unique and most famous messaging app, but the new updates keep going down and down. I find no utilities in the communities and the channels. To not mention, on my phone I encountered a bad glitch which anytime I make audios, there is no audio, just plain shut, no sound. I restarted my phone, cleared cache, did all I could do, but it seems this issue only belongs to WhatsApp because whenever I make audios on Discord, sound is perfectly audible."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Whenever I set my Profile Photo on WhatsApp, its quality decreases. Even if the actual photo is of HD Quality but still after updating profile photo, the quality decreases. Please bring New feature/option for HD quality profile photo and what is wrong with reply button in status? Reply button is taking too much space, whenever I view someone's status its bottom part got covered by reply menu. I am not able to see the bottom part of the status. Please fix it and make it the same as it was before."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new interface for the status section is unnecessary. Could have just left it the way it was before and just added channels at the bottom, but no, instead this unnecessary arrangement was done. There's even no clear distinction between the viewed and unviewed statuses and the highlights of the status being posted doesn't show again. Very unnecessary interface rearrangement."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Earlier app was good however due to one issue it is very irritating. Whenever i click any pic from whatsapp in landscape mode it automatically gets rotate. Please resolve the issue on priority. Getting this issue again and not able to sent voice note.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Rubbish, keeps crashing so can't recieve or send messages. It's up to date and tried uninstalling it but hasn't fixed the problem"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I like the app but I been having voice messages not sending and the mic doesn't pick up my voice even if it's in locked please fix this! It was working yesterday but now it doesn't please fix it 😔
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've noticed an issue with my privacy settings—specifically, excluding certain contacts from viewing my last seen, profile pic, about is not working as intended. Despite the settings, I can still see the last seen of those contacts. I'm using the latest WhatsApp version, and I've double-checked the privacy settings. Could you please assist in resolving this matter or provide guidance on any recent updates related to this issue?"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My Whatsapp account was hacked and cloned and it's being used to harass me. I have tried everything to kick out the hackers and it has been impossible. My personal information is being shared to everyone. This is a very bad application
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, WhatsApp is pretty much one of my main apps for calling or texting my friends. However if I'm in a videocall with someone the quality is basically non existing, it always glitches somehow which turns the person into pixels. Sometimes when I'm on a call with someone I can't hear what the other person is saying because their voice gets muffled and bass boosted so I need to hang up and recall them. But apart from all that this app is amazing, no huge issues but it does need improvement."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,WhatsApp support team is worst. They just send the same email again and again for the issue and the issue still persists. They don't help properly. I didn't received my login otp till now even after 32 hrs
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Remove the Reply tab from the stories. It was better as the hidden option and easier because you just had to swipe up to reply to that person. It has become so annoying now. If I want to read something in the stories, and there's an option of 'read more', I try clicking on that but instead of that, the reply tab opens. Please fix this and go back to how it was earlier."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I would give 4 star if they stayed the ""voice or video call"" icon on notification bar just as simple as before which phone and camera icon only. After the update they put the hours of calling which leads to no privacy. Like if you want a private call, people still can see you are calling someone instead of calling them in private. Also it's hard to check new messages since the icon is too big on the notification bar. Hope to change to the previous one instead."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Worst messenger I've ever seen. Why can't I just enter the number I need to start a chat with him? The function of providing access to all my contacts is disgusting, I don’t need it, it’s inconvenient. Nasty ""Meta"" just wants maximum access on my phone. Abomination!"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,bottom navigation bar is bad . give an option to swich between top and bottom navigation or atleast allow swipe to change tab . for every time we need to click on icon to change.

Worst service I ever had"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The old version of WhatsApp was fine, now even after adding a status, it is not uploaded in HD quality. I just want to say this, please pay attention."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,USERFRIENDLY AND YOU CANNOT SEND AMBIGUOUS MESSAGES SINCE YOU ARE NOW ABLE TO EDIT.

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Did my head in trying to restore what I backed and transferring everything to the new phone. Get the code from the old phone, now from the new phone, oh no the old phone ..... are you for real? And I still can't get what I backed up... you deserve no stars at all. Here's a suggestion for you, give the option to restore on the new phone and request a code, but obviously it has to be difficult and unreliable..... not what whatsapp claims"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Yesterday when I was going to save a contact, the app won't show it even if the number is correct. Then suddenly without any notification or permission ALL of my chats are gone! I checked the help and read the notes. I'm understand that WhatsApp can't restore because it's not saved on their server. But I didn't back it up yet, because my problem was my internal storage was full! Now it has a lot of space that my chats are gone, and I hate that. Why can't we just directly backup to Google Drive"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Very poor customer support. Staff not ready to resolve the issue but sending system messages repeatedly. I do not know home to address now? Looks like I may have to forgo use to app any more. Very bad experience with team.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Bad experience with the latest update. I can't get popular notifications. The message I get is "" popup notifications no longer available for your version of android."" It's very annoying that I had to choose only between vibration or ringtone notifications, neither of them I want. Also the added Channels are annoying. If I want to follow people and updates I have other platforms, no need on whatsapp."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have a brand new phone that WhatsApp came pre-installed alongside other apps like Facebook and YouTube. I noticed the first time I placed a call on WhatsApp it was perfect, then I tried to call a second person and my microphone was muted. I have factory reset my BRAND NEW phone 2 times already. Even when someone calls me they can't hear me. Before anyone asks, of course I have checked permissions, everything is working. Somehow I can open Signal app and it's not muted and works fine¡!!!!!"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Only reason for still having Whatsapp is that most people in Europe use it. Otherwise its a horrible messenger, whose development got stale like any product from Facebook. Bad phone call, video call quality. Videos & Pictures have always been compressed so much destroying them almost. Nothing innovative, the same thing for the 11 years I have been using Whatsapp."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm deeply frustrated with your service. For 1.5 months, I haven't received verification codes or calls due to a recurring ""1-hour error."" Your support has been unhelpful, sending repetitive message, emails. With no live chat, I rate WhatsApp support 0/10. Urgent action is needed."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Lost all chats and history when moving to a new phone. Did NOT prompt to restore from the google drive backup. When I tried to get them manually from the old phone, all app data was gone. Probably when it automatically logged me out from the app. No option to restore on the new one and it just overwrote the data in cloud. Unacceptable for such an old and big app."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great app. But when you've used gb and fm whatsapp when we come here we want more. We want the front screen to be designed to feel like home. Besides the awesome time I have using original there are other features from apps like gb and tm that we would love on whatsapp messenger to make it a little bit more fun
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Update: Even worse than before. Latest update has really screwed it up. Rings but doesn't show notification sometimes it doesn't ring at all. Absolutely terrible since the past few updates. While on video call if a sms or voice call rings my phone it disables audio on video call. If while in a video call I reduce screen then open say gmail...when I return it won't allow me to see the video. Pull down shows I am connected but there is no way to re open. Have 2 end call and reconnect

I am not able to see that option and if I want to see the status of a particular person I had to swipe until I reach that contact. I think it's better to give two tabs (with search option) under Updates one for Status and one for Channels. Also it would look good if we can switch the versions like old look and new look with all the added features.

Also, I can't see the other people status with time. This new UI change was never taken into consideration along with other features, etc. Which is very bad. Also, adding channels also made Ul dirty. Earlier, the UI was clean and easy to understand. Bring back old UI."

Now you open a 3 minute voicenote and it refuses to be played. How then do you explain to the sender that you couldn't play it? Someone needs to do something about irrelevant updates like this. Focus on perfecting what already exists and stop creating trash!!!"

What gives you the right to send me notifications when I've disabled it? And then not even respond to my question.... absolutely ridiculous."

If you do this then competition from the other brands will not be stiff"

"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good effort on the upgrade. I would prefer to have the option to search out statuses by contact name rather than having to scroll through all statuses in search of my most preferred statuses. Also, I'd suggest notifications on preferred status uploads (not all). It should be easy to automate judging by the statuses I view most frequently above others. Also consider creating a built-in feature to set reminders to important messages within the app or permit integrations that solve for this."

This makes no sense given that all my other apps/calls on my phone are fine and even my WhatsApp can send messages. 🤔 Edit: now able to receive messages but app is still constantly looking for messages."

It's very disturbing and I would appreciate it if I get help on how to turn it off. It shouldn't be in our phone settings but in that person info on Whatsapp, there should be an option under that person's info that says if we want to mute their calls or mute their messages. It's way more accessible and easier. I hope this note gets to the team😞. Thank you."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Removed Names of Phone Contacts: The last update this year altered my phone contacts. It removed saved names of most of my contacts and I am now struggling to save the names of family members, friends and acquaintances afresh. This is one of the worst updates and its outcome is what a virus can do but it wasn't a virus. It was whatsapp update."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very easy to use and quickly respond to messages. and for those of you who just don't want others peeking over your shoulder and reading your messages you can also enable the built-in fingerprint lock by heading to the settings and then privacy and enable fingerprint lock from there it's really secure so you don't need to worry about people reading your messages because it's all end to end encrypted even whatsapp can't read your messages or even listen to your calls or anything.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I hate this channel feature, please don't make WhatsApp the next instacrap new UI is garbage, you moved navigation to bottom , now one big block is navigation bar, instead use floating navigation bar like google chat."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"One of the worst messenger apps . I rarely use it. Nothing special happens after each update and even after many updates when you delete a message tell everyone that you delete your message! It is a ridiculous problem . And other problems like time limitation in downloading videos my mean is when someone send you a video, if you see his or her video after approximately at least one week , you can't download it . Zuck somehow makes fun of us with this funny and useless app."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is a good app, no, the best. I used it as my primary communication app. The only thing I don't like is the new update where they put the status and chats on the bottom. Can we have it back on the top, please? Thank you"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love the app although I feel it needs an option to split the group chats from individual chats. Sometimes it can become too much to scroll through them all together
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Edit: Why am I the only one who sees my review? Review:The new interface which has the Status bar at the bottom of the screen is an unnecessary update. It should be reserved only for those who choose to have it since it does not serve any practical purpose. It does not look appealing either. It takes too much getting used to. It needs to be optional. You should take notes from the modified WhatsApp applications, the mods have settings which allow modifying your own interface it's not imposed."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Message previews and the new message notifications just hang at the top of the screen until manually cleared even after opening the app compared to every other app where the pop up notifications goes away on its own after 2 seconds leaving just the notification in the notification tray. You have to manually clear the pop-up notifications. Tapping on them will not open the app and opening the app or using quick reply will not get rid of the notification.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,When releasing new updated version have you ever think of uneducated people who are using WhatsApp. Do you have any idea how much it will impact for user experience. You have changed complete layout of page. Its not good update dear team.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App got verse... with the big tabs at the bottom. I don't need to use channels and communities, salt there is no option to remove them. Instead of having separate tabs for group chats, you guys have wasted time on channels and communities. Have 2 versions of Whatsapp, one for new generation and other one for seniors"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Alot of interesting things and features have been integrated to the system making it more easier to messaging and chatting.. Looking forward for more advancement,people are becoming highly intelligent using What's App videos chatting, groups chats not minding the distance.It makes it pretty easy to chatting with your old classmates,love ones, families in far distance. My good advice is for consistency in the technology being used.God bless."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,No calls option for each contact should present in the what's app. Many good features are present in GB or fm whatsapp but not present in whatsapp. This is not goog. So many features are not provided which are surely needed.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Sorry but I wanted to give a negative rating if it was possible. This app isn't usable now. Everyday my WhatsApp account suggests as blocked I really can't understand for what. But everyday I request for a review and get a message of apology. My account reopens for 2 or 3 hours then the same cycle starts . I can't even message to my friends when I want. This is just not fair service.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I can't add another number yet it can't allow me to use another version of WhatsApp, it keeps saying I need the official version, which one is the official one if it's not this one. It can't verify my number too. Am beginning to doubt it's validity if it's problems are not sorted"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The recent new feature of whatsapp which lead to reduced or blurry quality of photos and videos after uploading is very very annoying .I really hate this thing .Its needed to be fixed as soon as possible.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very nice and satisfied. But the problem is, it kept saying i need to switch to the official whatsapp. Isnt this the official whatsapp? When i click it, it brought me to here. And it says i downloaded already but the message keep popping up. Please fix this issue"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Since the update, I can no longer receive popup notifications from WhatsApp. All the settings are correct, permissions to run in the background, everything. It just says ""Popup notifications: Not available"" and when you click on it, it further details ""Popup notifications are no longer available in your version of Android"". How is this possible?! Both the phone (Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra) and WhatsApp are fully up-to-date. Yet I can't see any popup notifications for WhatsApp anymore. Fix this!"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"In my new phone (Google pixel 8 pro), I am unable to save the notification settings. I have tried re-installing and many other things, but it just doesn't seem to work. It is getting extremely frustrating that after using WhatsApp for so many years, I have to reconsider other communication channels and ask the close ones to move too."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Runs well on one phone but will NOT work on two devices even though it promises it can. Either one works and it then says to ""log into link on other phone"" but other phone is disabled saying its logged my 1st phone. When i log in on 2nd phone it disables the other phone and the reverse happens. VERY annoying as it is since a good program on one phone (5star) it useless (0 stars) on multiple phones. You would think the makers of a great program would be able to make this failure easily go away."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Sometimes when you open the Sticker tab, somehow it glitches and the part where messages can be seen becomes minimal. Also would be really helpful for people with waay too many Stickers for it to be possible to add a ""Tag"" to them (literally, write something), and be able to find by Tag, besides an alphabetical order of sorts for it. That in itself would be 3 stars. Minus one because it's Meta, therefore very concerning privacy."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Not getting verification code. I tried to contact whatsapp support team they are useless. They are sending forward messages but not giving any solution for the issue
"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,My whatsapp settings had been deleted and now I am without WhatsApp facilities since three days or so. Why and who deleted and what for. Who will answer? Convincingly and when the deleted settings will be reversed so that one can use whatsapp as before without any interference. Thanks
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Nice app, easy to use but one thing i hate is the disappearing message can you please let the message disappear for only the person who turned on and not for the person who don't... Like the message disappear for the person who used only and still stay the same for the other."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"""Seriously, it is the worst app nowadays. Once I send an image or video, I can't cancel the upload. Nothing works, and also, the forwarded messages are not in proper order; they merge up and down."""
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Can't open any chats, it immediately crashes the app. Tried restarting the app, clearing cache, restarting my phone, and reinstalling the app and no matter what I try I can't open any chat with any person without the app crashing. This has been going on for months for me now and to not be able to communicate on a communication app is definitely a severe issue that needs to be addressed."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is make everything very easy like my conversations with my contact people. Thank you WhatsApp for this easy method to talk people very easy and safe connecting people very easily and the end to end encryption is very safe for everyone But I suggest WhatsApp to do update chat lock bcoz there is privacy needed Thank you.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Lately you've been adding lots of updates and features and even though it is good, it has just increased and introduced more bugs, glitches and overall slowed down the app performance. The instant video message features doesn't work anymore. The app has lots of glitches and it slows down when trying to access and pick an image or stickers or emojis to send. Sometimes I can't even see my messages until I exit the emoji panel. Why don't you focus less on adding features and make the app robust"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,A reliable means of communication but not a variety of options to choose from to personalize on and make it captivating and interesting not to mention normal chats and group chats 'cooking in the same pot'
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I find the new update of WhatsApp's status icon and channels to be quite frustrating. The status icon, which used to be a simple text status, has now been replaced with a circular image that often doesn't convey much information. It's a step backward in terms of user-friendliness.As for channels, while they were intended to be a way to follow specific topics or interests, they seem to clutter the chat interface and make it more confusing to navigate."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really don't like the appearance of the new horizontal status uploads. It's boring and spares us details of what people have posted. Besides scrolling from right to left easily takes u to call log instead! Please review this and if possible, bring back the vertical outlook of status updates. I personally don't view status updates anymore!!!"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Videos and photos when upload on status are of very poor quality Be innovative and add some new functionality, like maybe 'schedule massage' we are tired of this same old WhatsApp and having updates who changes or adds anything. What is even the need of updates if nothing is added or modify? I would have given a 1 start but is ok. GBwhatsapp is still better than this. I've been using the original WhatsApp for a week now and I can say without doubt that the app is trash 🤦🏾‍♂️."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Whatsapp app is one of it kind. This app has peculiar features that have kept man up and doing. It has brought friends, family, and long-distance relationships closer. With the advent of this app, communication is made easier ,working is alot better . However, I would also recommend that some interference on the connection should be reduced to make it worthwhile."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The newest update that changes the ENTIRE layout of the app is so annoying! It was not needed and I really hope this changes.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's unfortunate to hear that you're dissatisfied with the recent update to WhatsApp. Can you provide more details about what specifically you find challenging or problematic with the user experience?

On top of that, I have been blocked and accused of spam. This has occurred six times and I demand it be stopped. And this is not an issue concerning updating this app. Please something should be done about it with immediate effect cause I have been patient and my patience is not stopping the mishap rather it's becoming worse. Stop meddling with my account and blocking me with accusations of spam."

I fail to understand this, even when I removed end to end encryption, it still does not restore my data. Sick of it.... And then there is no support call number to talk to someone and get this resolved faster. You have to keep hanging with it just hoping that something may or may not correct 3, 4, 5 days later for one lowsy encryption process that puts a huge barrier between 2 devices."

Other than that, I like its simplicity."

Back ups also apparently fail silently, without warning. Clearly, message retention / reliability is not a focus of WhatsApp. Would advise anyone to use an alternative messaging app (either more reliable like telegram or more privacy sensitive like signal)."

Notifications don't come through they only come through from my phones notification connection so even when I do get one I have to dismiss that notification in order to open the whatsapp and reply from there...But like I said it doesn't even sync up so most of the time I have to go find my phone and open it up there totally defeating the point of the app!"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Recent update that comes with status viewing clicking a contacts profile picture is boring. At least the prompt should appear asking one whether to view the status update or the profile picture. With the new model there's no option to search for status by name. That is greatly unuser friendly. Brings the vibe of ""a user interface is like a joke, you are not supposed to explain it someone"""
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Before the update, WhatsApp was used only for personal contacts and privacy, now it has done all this nonsense to people who do not like it, what will they do please explain it and remove it. Please remove this updated version,where status and all are shown in downwards please remove it ,it's so annoying"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The new UI is really good looking and clean. However, the feature that allowed us to swipe and change tabs (from chat tab to calls log/tab) was very convient. It was a comfortable feature which is now replaced by shifting the tab screen to the bottom. It's a request to add the swipe feature back while keeping the new UI as the swipe feature really allows a smooth experience for the users. I beilive this will benefit the users as well as the providers of this platform"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It was worst idea to make Whatsapp a public platform. It was a close end perosnal messaging app. Secondly, Statuses option has removed search option where you could look up for a specific person. Thirdly, my video message Option is not working even after update. Really disappointed!! Update: video status option is still not working even after latest update. PS: really hate the status outlook of channels taking all space and minimizing contacts statuses to icons. Re-arrange the size it's bad."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After updates, many bugs with whatsapp have cropped up. The new Ul is so confusing. The channel introduction has really screwed up the status bar. Also, the earlier original orientation, which was vertical for status, was always better. In the horizontal one, it is really difficult and frustrating to understand which are the new updates and which are old. The servers seem to be too full if Facebook, and hence, the backups are not completed on a daily basis, but maybe 2 times a week only. Sad"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I don't know why WhatsApp is logging everyone out of the third party WhatsApp, the third party WhatsApp has more features than the normal WhatsApp. I will really appreciate it if group chat can be separated from the individual chat and if we can also save status that we find interesting directly to our phone. I don't like it when someone sent me message and deleted it, unlike GB WhatsApp that I can still view the message."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Please this new home buttons arrangement from up now to down makes the home page looks like GbWhatsApp and it hides some contacts as one scroll up.

I like that we are now able to create two accounts using a single app. Saves space and time. I also like that we are able to find and follow pages of our favourite people. But my problem is that when i follow a page or two, the people's statuses line up and only show their display pictures making it hard to spot a glintch of what has been posted. Thats annoying. What if we follow pages and statuses dont change? Thanks"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The worst possible updates & unnecessary things/features to screw up with the application & the data within. Due to dubious restore notifications from the application I have been losing my data for the last 1 month & that too because I backed up & restored my chat which was shown by the application that if I would not restore it now, I shall never be able to restore it. Disgusting updates, the application was way better before when it was simpler, just used for communication."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm pretty much disappointed with this latest updated version as the statuses goes horizontally rather than the vertical way I am familiar with, this does not enables one to get to choose the statuses he would want to check or not at a time. The introduction of Whatsapp channels to the platform is quite an innovation but I strongly believe that creating a different section for it would be very much better so that the platform can more user-friendly as it used to be."

Looking clustered and old UI was good and simple.. why I want to see the channel details here. This can be in under the settings section. Whoever wishes to the channel option they can see others don't need it... Also, in the status section, earlier already saw and yet to see two were there now all are clustered. Please change"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Whatsapp was good and simple to use..but the recent feature of channels has made it complicated. Also the status of your near once are not visible like it happened earlier. We need to search for the status instead.Whatsapp should have two different options as channels and status. Kindly consider the request of all the people. As it has become complicated to use.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,One of the worst messenger service in the world as i have been locked out of my account amd these people keep sending auto send emails instead of resetting my authentication on their side to fix the issue.

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am beginning to wonder whether the developers are actually using the app themselves. I am attempting to restore a backup on a new phone from Google drive, which simply causes the app to crash. Attempting to manually restoring the backup is impossible because the old phone is now logged out.

And now, I am completely locked out."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Whatsapp has failed as an app. What is with this downloading the official whatsapp app when I got mine from google store and still can't access my account. I've deleted and re-downloaded so many times and it's still the same thing.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Please, give an option to disable channels feature and put back the search icon for status updates. You can put drop down option for status so it can still show vertically (That is to scroll through your list of status updates). That horizontal scroll is not convenient and it's limiting. The option to see your individual status posts should be returned too (Those 3 dots at the side that shows you a list of your status posts and the views). Developers, let's keep this app original!!!"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"✨🚨SUGGESTION: 1. Add feature to delete chats and/or image & video & docs before user given date (take this as input), and optionally control deletion of stared items. It will help clean old data. I am NOT talking about disappearing messages. 2. Add a universally common and easy way to transfer WhatsApp data from iOS to Android and vice-versa. Example: add ability to export/create and import/restore backup file which could be an OS independent archive format."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The new ""Updates"" panel is all wrong. The ""Channels"" section is completely useless and feels forced on the user, especially because there's no option to turn it off.

No preview of status, only profile pictures are shown. Also the full name is not visible. Status viewrship has been decreased drastically with this update. There should be separate bars for chanel and status. Status should be shown just like before previous update, i.e in columns, status previews helps a lot to pick and choose the status and full name helps to identify the exact person"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I get that you are competing with Telegram making features like can edit messages after sending etc. and the latest is the reply status option (how it looks in the app).

I could only archive chats to clear up some space because the view is very crowded and overwhelming. Thank you for considering this."

Meta is trying to force users to use WhatsApp channels and not giving disable option. Meta is trying to kill telegram by copying it's features but come on I will use telegram for that which is much better in functionality. I am not able to leave WhatsApp due to my organisation, but for some months only this is going to be problem. After that I will shift to RCS soon after so much chaos."

It's been 2 weeks now and all efforts to get back the account has been fruitless simply because whatsapp stopped sending new otp to the affected number. I written the support centre severally to intervene but they're not responding to my mails. My contacts are not safe because the scammers are spamming them requesting money from them.

"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,What I really want in your next update is for one to easily save status when viewing it instead of going through other apps like status saver which is really stressful. And also pls remove the big reply tab under the status and bring back the old style

I almost lost a grant opportunity because of this. It didn't help that the delete function has an option to delete a message for myself, which in panic I did tap because IT WAS THE ONLY ONE COLOURED GREEN. This stupid glitch almost cost me a grant. Horrible."

Since my contact hit 13k my WhatsApp has been hanging. Takes forever to update even with a very good network. Unlike telegram that once you login the app your messages are automatically updated. Another thing is some of my contacts don't see my status update. Why? And it'll be lovely if you can add an update for us to know who has our contact, just like IG. You can know who's following you."

Her attempts to contact whatsap have been unsuccessful as she keeps getting an automated reply. clearly whatsapp doesn't care about its customers as this is now impacting me and my family.

Marka zukabaga or whatever he is should stop issues of monopoly and let other developers improve these things. This app is surely obsolete in the mordern app world."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The last version is not good. Because it focuses on Channels by affecting Statuses... It's being really difficult to split the viewed statuses and current statuses... Make it like a older version... It's looks like whatsapp

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Whatsapp has far diverged from it's original messenger objectives into Meta's milking cow that is being squeezed too hard. The amount of spam from businesses is ridiculous and intrusive 'features' are at an all time high. The UI has become user-unfriendly. I Switched to Telegram full time and don't regret it.

But my main problem now is that Whatsapp automatically save cache status on my phone, whether i open the app or not. And the cache status is consuming space in my storage. I don't know if I'm the only one this is happening to or y'all haven't took note."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love WhatsApp!!! It's a million times better and safer than Google Chat!!! Highly Recommend!!! The Only Things that I really hate about WhatsApp are The View Once Button when You're sending Media and The fact that You can't hide your IP Address. Please get rid of the Web Version of WhatsApp because it's becoming a magnet for Scammers and Fake Decoys pretending to be real honest people. Apart from that it is one of The Best Messaging Apps out there.

"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"WhatsApp is a great app, no doubt. However, I think there are a few important things to be done. When I delete a message, it's so unnecessary to notify the other person. I have to explain why I deleted a message to the person I'm chatting to, every time? Yes, they ask! Secondly, can we upload a status of up to 2 minutes? Having to break it into 30 seconds is really annoying and makes the status unnecessarily long. It really shouldn't be a problem if I want to upload a 5-minute video, please."

Moreover, you can't even rely on the Google backup bc they won't let you download it and you can't restore it if you've changed your phone number. Customer service only uses a copy paste bot of useless FAQs that have nothing to do with your problem. I will limit my usage of this app at all costs from now on."

If u can't give that features then won't have any right to stop users using mod application. People who liked plz support.

While I appreciate the efforts to enhance the user experience, I find the new channel feature to be less preferable. I kindly request that you consider adding an option to hide or disable this feature. This would allow users like myself to personalize our experience and focus on the aspects that are most relevant to our needs. Hoping for the best to hide or disable channel feature so i will change my feedback."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"CAN'T SWIPE RIGHT to see STATUS from the chat sction like before, gotta touch the new buttons instead. Also the new update moved the title bars (chats, status, calls) to the bottom of the screen. This negatively affects usage in a lot of cases because new received chats are placed at the top, which is difficult to reach with 1 hand on big screens. Before, new chats were more around the middle because the title bars(chat, status, calls) were on top, resulting in easy access to new messages."

Whenever I try to scroll down looking for a message in a chat, WhatsApp skips so many messages and takes me to a date far later than I want to get to. I always have to scroll back and take it slowly so I find the message I was looking for. Very subtle I know, but when compounded, it can be very annoying. Iwanna look over a message real quick and I find myself in 4daysago.Notnice"

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,WhatsApp is a basic app GB WhatsApp is 100×better but for some reasons instead of adding the features that GB WhatsApp users are enjoying the rather get rid off GB WhatsApp. This is a huge company that can add features like 1.freezing your last seen 2.downloading WhatsApp status of someone else without using a third party app and alot more things .

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"the original version of WhatsApp is boring and the fact that the company is blocking the moded versions is so annoying since some of us have heard peaceful lives away from people monitoring our lives online by the services from the moded versions and you should take a measure of allowing users to use the versions of their choice since you should know that they will always make other ones better than the original and people will always run to the other side,,,so just up accept the competition,,,"

"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Technology is advancing but it seems like Whatsapp owners do not want to move with it. Instead of fighting the other versions of Whatsapp you should find a way of imitating them and improve Whatsapp. 1. Separate group chats from the other chats. 2. Introduce an option for saving and reposting WhatsApp status. Must we download a different status saver app again? 3.....blablablabla....

I noticed this same behavior on the latest whatsapp for desktop on my MacBook Pro as well. It's very annoying. I never had issues with the older versions of whatsapp. The new updates just introduced bugs, in my opinion, and the new features weren't necessary."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"One thing I know for sure I don't like the UI of the Official WhatsApp, your developers are too slow, you have a rival like GBWhatsApp, WhatsApp Plus, I wonder what it's taking too long for you to introduce some featurs like what we see used by whatsApp Plus and GBWhatsApp. Otherwise you will continue to fight them every day of your existence. With that I can't give you any better star I wish there was star zero, that would fit you better."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Currently listening to voice notes on this app is annoying. It keeps behaving like I am receiving a call. The screen goes off the moment I play a voice note and it starts playing from the ear speaker for calls instead of the external one. It's so annoying and sometimes while playing it stops and switches to the external then stops and switches to the in ear speaker. This is by far the most annoying user experience I have seen on any app for voice recordings.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Why must everything be monetized why can't we just have a simple messaging service. The quality has gone down since they introduced the new features. We don't need the new features we just wanted to send messages.

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have a major problem with this new update. I hate the introduction of channels and the new interface. That is even the least of my problems. I always wake up in the morning ok nly to realize that my gallery has a new WhatsApp Cached Status folder. All statuses of my contacts are downloaded to this folder and it's draining my bundle.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I'll give it full star once the calling features get back !!!! I mean earlier it shows CALLING only when the other person is offline & while the other person is online it shows RINGING.

"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I dislike the newer updates because whenever I follow a channel, the format of the statuses listed before changes to circles in a row with their profile pictures. This makes it impossible to see the full names and preview of the last status posted for each person. It would be better if WhatsApp could provide an option to choose between having the statuses listed or displayed on a single row. Alternatively, they should bring back the status section we used to know."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The whole idea of showing status updates in horizontal format is really poor especially for those of us with a long list of contacts. Also, the fact that it shows the pp and not image of last status post makes it even less interesting to view statuses.

When you are in a group and you update your WhatsApp you'll loss all the information and you will have to ask for the information to be resent into the group and no one has time to waste his or her bundle to send it for you again and will lead to data loss.

I always forget the new ones while I love using them! Also, before when someone called me through What's app the call would come up and I could pick up normally. Now, when someone calls me through what's app I have to unlock my phone first, then open what's app, then take the call. Strange how this changed and also annoying tbh."

Everytime I got a dot in the update section I think someone has put some status, but instead it is some message in a random channel. Also the UI is not appealing for the updates section only. What the designers could have done is, merging the channel section in the community section and leave the updates section as it was before(ie status section). It breaks the consistency and continuity of the users."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I find that the app works really well for me, however I have huge concerns about its reliability. I have never noticed an issue with message retention, even as I transferred to new phones, but two UK Prime Ministers have now publicly sworn on oath that thousands of their messages have simply disappeared as the app ""went down"" and then ""came up again"" or when they changed phones. WhatsApp, please investigate and fix this major bug, so that we all can have confidence in the app once more."

Please keep Ads and any external social influence far away from what's supposed to be a private, personal messaging app, and don't show the stupid face of celebs right under what's supposed to be the STATUS tab.

Now that you are forcing everyone to go back to the official WhatsApp, at least learn from the modded versions and implement some of the features there, e.g., separate normal chats and group chats or theme packs readily available. Now being forced back to official WhatsApp is like having a taste of Windows 10 OS and then going back to Windows 98 OS. Modded version care for user experience, emulate that!"

Pls do something to avoid this.

Can we modify the slide button for chat audio, It seems that slips sometimes while holding the voice button and gets closed, so can we arrange this option to double tap or single on-off button? 2. This is regarding the privacy part of status, there are created option buttons, like contacts, including, and excluding, so can we replace the checkbox for multiple choice, it would be better if we could add total 5 check box."

The app only works when it feels like it, the voice recording feature sounds terrible compared to just about any other app, it chooses to not let you send photos sometimes for absolutely no reason, it insists you save every photo and video sent to you, personalised notification tones reset everytime the app updates which is probably every week..."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Would be 5 stars if Facebook (which owns Whatsapp) cared about people's privacy. If you or the person you're talking to backs up their chats, the government can pretty easily read everything. One good thing: they finally added the ability to hide when you're online, although the person you are chatting with can still see if you are typing. Whatsapp is easy to use & you can call/text/video chat with anyone in the world for free. Calls are usually good quality. You can also send large files."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Horrible placement of menus. Keep it back to as it was or give an option to change it. Why do you devs try to copy ios format.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'd like an upgrade for the Channels feature. After forwarding a message, I'd prefer to return to where I left off. Prioritize channels with new messages, move them down once opened. When opening links from a channel, an option for in-app or direct website access would be convenient for user preference. Adding pinned channel groups or favorite groups in channels would also be appreciated. Thank you, kind devs!"

I set different ringtone for my two whatsapp account and after i open WhatsApp again both accounts have same ringtone i tried multiple times but the same problem persists. A quick bug fix update can fix it maybe

"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Why the look is different on my phones? Even though the installed version of WhatsApp is the same. On my Xiaomi 13T, for example, you can see people's profile pictures when opening a group chat, while on my Samsung S23 is just their name. Also the navigation bar is different. On Xiaomi 13T it's located at the bottom, while on Samsung S23 it is at the top, just like the old version of WhatsApp. Very strange."

Instead of actually looking into the matter they start pointing fingers at me that maybe I don't have a supported sim or a stable Internet etc etc. I gave them my number to fix this but again an automated email was all that was sent. Pathetic experience

"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a very good app that's help connect round the world.. Imaging making calls with your data at a very affordable rate than using a local network that charges highly.. Well WhatsApp is that app that just brings it all together.. 🥰 The 1 star left is for the quality of photos and videos that ate bring reduced when shared..
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Found couple of bugs 1) Sending documents is a irritating task as it takes long time to send even if I have a good internet connection 2) when I try to open someone's status it doesn't open at first time. I have to press back button and then I have to open it after that I am able to see status.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The updated screen sharing and edit options are great, but to edit a message, I have to first select it, then click the three dots icon, which takes a while. It should work like this: after tapping the message twice, the edit option should appear fast. Please fix this issue."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Improvement suggestion: several old people have their fingers worn out thus unlocking via fingerprint is a tough task. On the other hand they still want to lock the app for privacy purposes. If you can introduce a pin option for secure locking and unlocking they'd not have to depend on 3rd party app locks for the same.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Whatsapp has been a great and useful buh I have one feature or lemme say suggestion I suggest you guys add sounds on status updates what I mean is that when one maybe updates his status with a video or a Picture , one can add a sound to it just like Snapchat stories.. I find it convenient to use so I decided to let you guys know about it ... In all WhatsApp has been a great tool for me keep the great work up ."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The only reason I used whatsapp was because Facebook compresses (ruins) any photos you send. Facebook/meta now owns Whatsapp and has ruined this too. The losers keep forcing me to install updates that do literally nothing, and prevent me from using the app with a block screen that pops up in front of it. The app would still work fine otherwise."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,In previous versions i was able to download any document uploaded at any time. But this version doesn't allow you to download a document from a chat after few days. AIso is updated once in two months. I don't know why they don't add such small features at once. It is kind of irritating.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Archive chats!!! There should be a separate media settings for archive chats. So, I've my media download set to download on WIFI because it helps me get needed media faster at work. But the setting also download lot of unwanted media from archives chats. Leaving me chunk of time sorting for media that are necessary and exhausting my storage space with unneeded ones. Archives chat shouldn't be autonomous! Same way I view them at my convenience, should it be when it comes to their media download."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"No notifications for text messages at all. The only notification for calls is sound, no screen info. The program update completely blocked access to chats. In case of limited time or mobile data it is crazy bad!"

Edit: they stopped forcing them, I adjusted my rating from 1 star to 4 stars as I do enjoy the app as long as the app doesn't force me to update when they want to. I still don't like that every update is a must nowdays but I appreciate having the option to choose WHEN I'll do the update."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Hi, this is my first time giving a feed back. An update is urgently needed. Whatsapp status video quality. It can be put in HD but the quality is lost when it becomes status. No matter how you look at it, there is no escape. There is no such problem when taking a photo. So I believe that a decision will be taken soon"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app has been good as I have been using it but it has the problem of frequent updating which something must be done. Too much updating makes it hard for me because sometimes I will be off for some weeks or months try to make some changes to help me and others.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app is only used for data stealing. The app is available in the phone even after uninstalling. This app should be banned. It records our voice and use it for their ad in other Meta services. That's the reason the folder is now created inside Android folder in phone.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very happy with the app, using it every day in stead of ""old skool"" text messages. Would be nice though if you could have a ""favorites"" button on top of the list with messages. Click on this favorites button, and you go to the chat with that contact."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"In WhatsApp where chat, update and calls are three options side by side, it would be better to have another option called groups. Because there are many chats and groups together sometimes it becomes difficult to find. So if chats and groups had separate options, groups would have been in the groups option very easily and it would have been convenient to find."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's and awesome aqq, lve used it for 7 years I can send audios, long ones. I can send and receive long videos It's fantastic.

And now on with the new version updated with the group call! It became really good 🤩 that's amazing, but there's another point that I wanted to hammer on is that ! WhatsApp is always green can't you get another version so that we got other colors?"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I don't like its update window And channels which has been directly shown below the status It made the whats app rubbish. Minor improvements need to be done 1 we need clean status window i.e separate for channels in search buttons (Like telegram). If u don't use channels then just create mess only 2 new feature:put uknown no. in th search opt. of new chat is good But It should be given in direct search window as well, as nobody like to go to new chat then chat followed by search. Lot to say,"
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There was no point changing the status reply interface. The previous one is far better in every way.

"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is a good communication app even though it has some problems. Screen freeze has rarely happened to me.

It works pretty well on my phone, there are barely any issues, however I would really appreciate it if you could add the option to mention all the people in a group chat, since it gets rather tiring when someone wants to tell something to all the participants of the group."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The only issue I have is that WhatsApp should have the feature to automatically convert videos and pictures into files, transferring them in their original format. This way, the quality of the documents wouldn't be compromised. Apart from that, everything else is great."

Still, You could not resolve those issues in this version.if anyone introduce better app with better feature definitely I should convert to that app. Status problem still continuing from last 3 months after updated this app. Meta is not responding till now, but AI is not uploaded our video's in status, how they are care for us.

I hope this issue will be solved so I can go back to using this app again."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Can you make it option for us to update the app. User should opt when to download the updates. Do not force user to update application by your terms. It is so annoying sometimes when app failed to update with error popup. At that point you can't even use the app. So annoying.

The status which we upload is not completly loading..when we view our status through other phone.. we notice that the quality of video also is not good.(as compared to the same video when viewed in my gallery)...

"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good job to the developer and modifiers, but I want to say that the uniqueness of WhatsApp is the ability to scroll on status update vertically, pls leave the horizontal for Facebook and Instagram. Moreso, display of the recent post of status is what triggers the attention of contacts to view the content not the profile picture that keeps showing. Rectify this please"

"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Can you just remove the channels from whatsapp. That""s so annoying for people who don't use channels. It will be better than this to have a button or smth to on or off channels. And also the new status layout is horrible. The past one is better. We don't want whatsapp to be Instagram or Facebook, etc."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Good app but i think it needs more features for groups and comunities i own a group chat that im an admin on it so i can change the settings on their but one thing i cant do anything about is when some of my friends in that group text so fast 50 or 100 (sometimes 999 over the number limit) they arent spam wise but i think there should be some more features like customisable message cooldown timer so once that timer goes down they can text again slowing it but still able to text

"March 11, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"1.To get to a specific date, there should be a calender like option. One could do that by tapping on the date shown at the top. 2. There should be a feature of ""Timer message"" like if I wanna send a message to someone on a specific time, I can set that timing."

The end to end encryption for backing up chats, is extremely sketchy, I don't trust it... I'm also annoyed because this app does not support sending and receiving USDC, USDT, or BTC cryptocurrency."

"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,There is no option for users to approve or disapprove message requests from unknown numbers. Whoever wants to text; just jumps into your inbox without your consent. There must be a setting exactly like Facebook and Instagram. If someone wants to text you on WhatsApp; there must be an option if we want to allow them or not. And till the time we approve their request; they must not know if we have received their message on Whatsapp or not. It's a major privacy concern. Pay attention to it.

"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Whatsapp remains my best texting app but recently it has start to display glitches that are so good for the app's reputation. I hope your team fix this up. I'm talking about how my status update icon appears not to have been sent after I send it and has been sent.
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Thanks for this app really helpful. However i suggest make it possible to play audios without stopping them when the phone sensor is blocked or when my screen goes to sleep such that sessions do not get always off giving me a hard time to again unlock and continue playing.

I am a dedicated user of WhatsApp and greatly appreciate the platform's functionality and convenience.I'm writing to inquire if there are any plans to introduce a feature that would allow users to send messages or images with transparent backgrounds within the WhatsApp application.

"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I've been trying to use Transfer Chats feature to port all the chats to new phone but it simply doesn't seem to be working for me. At this point the only solution seems to be using my new phone's WhatsApp as linked companion device. 😥 does transfer chats feature even works in real-time?
"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"i really love the app so much, i just want to mention one thing. I value aesthetic a lot. I'm really sad about the emoji colors of black heart and kiss on Android. It really upsets me that we see a navy blue heart instead of a romantic jet black. And that kiss emoji is literally gypsy pink. I think that's a huge discrimination between android and iOS and i think this needs to get changed anymore. I want to be able to express and receive romantic feelings, and i can't with these colors."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Everything is good. But the channels section is of no use and the worst thing is I can't even get rid of them. You guys can create another app for channels else at least give an option to hide those useless and annoying things..
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Over all the app is good so far , but the only thing that I don't like the most is when it comes to video or photo tht you posted on status is so cracks like damn hate it so much.. please update the video or photo quality on status for Whatsapp it's 2024 already...😭 You cannot beat the Instagram video and photo quality when you posted it 👍👍👍"

"March 11, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Years back people were impressed with Mixit but WhatsApp is the Ferrari of messaging apps! I literally went from Mixit to WhatsApp and that was the end of it. I know there are lots of messaging apps but who needs any of them when you can just settle for WhatsApp. You'll find everything you need and more. The interface is very easy and I'll continue using WhatsApp until my dying day!! 👌👍😁🇿🇦
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app would be great if it allowed status and profile picture download and sending many messages is also unpleasant. I uploaded just a video to 50 chats three days ago but up to now I keep on resending can't complete. Very disgusting The issue of backing up messages is really disturbing. Why don't you creators look into this and solve it? Recently I lost 100 per cent of all messages sent to me while I was off for just 48 hrs. I think it is ridiculous

I always become dissapointed when i send my status or send videos or pictures to someone.They get very blurry and they look like ghost.I want to share high quality content but here whatsapp is playing like an idle dog. On the other hand other very low ranking applications are providing us video, photo sharing facility without eating their quality."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My god this whatsapp is terrible it's my first most disgusted experience it's that bad. Say for instance you text somone, they replied but you're no longer in the app at the point you wait the entire century for the message and nothing is wrong with the internet or the phone. And another time the app annoys your phone saying you have new messages to your dismay they are none😡😡😡😡"

As there is great improvement now to the extent that I say it is good."
"March 11, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Read and Unread chats are not organised . To search a person when u type and get multiple contact when you tap to the person and come back every time you have to type same name for search. Also a problem when link to other devices your lock chat appears and unlock in that device. Hence licking is not effective in other link devices.
