Waste of time. I create a whole video, edit, add music, spend time making it perfect then after upload all my work is GONE. It shows the first 5 seconds then freezes and ends the video. So frustrating. This has happened so many times. Even after waiting a few days to try again. It is so incredibly frustrating."

Sometimes, when I try to post something it just goes to 99% and stops there and deletes the entire video I just worked so hard on, and now I have to start from scratch. I haven't pressed anything whatsoever, however Iljust find it really troublesome having to stress over posting videos PRAYING it won't delete. 1 person found this helpful"

Also, I can't use tiktok for more than twenty minutes because then the videos stop loading and I can't watch them for over an hour. It's apparently an issue with my WiFi being slow, but if I have my WiFi and data on it still doesn't load. My WiFi works perfectly, so I think it's a problem with the app."

There's a certain video I can't download at all, but every other video is fine. Sometimes my likes don't go through cause of ""server issues"" so I can't find them afterward. Too many times I can't favorite a video so I can find it later. And before you say it, yes, I've gone back and all these videos still exist days/weeks/months after my problem, including the accounts. So in short, it's starting to get worse."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Love this app but I one thing I hate is that some features aren't available for everyone. I have tried everything to get photo mode to work and no matter what I do it's not available for me. It's available for friends in my area and every creator I follow. It's really frustrating because I'm a content creator myself and would like the opportunity to utilize these posts! There is no technical support either which is extremely frustrating

But this is super weird to me, I just swipe away immediately and they come back after one or two different ads. Its super annoying, but the app itself is fine, i just don't know where else to post this problem."

It looks good, then when going to publish, throws text and overlays all over the place, off screen, etc. Is this a push to get me to delete the app? Cause I'm about at that point. Not the first time, but definitely getting worse."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app and all EXCEPT how some different device types have more features. The one thing that I want is to be able to post a photo in a comment. I have a Google pixel and I'm not sure which type of phone (I'm pretty sure it's apple) that can post pictures in the comments but I would like that on every phone type. Overall, its a pretty good app. Would recommend if your fine with a few less features then others"

You can search for the type of video you would like to see and the algorithm locates videos based on what you have watched, liked and commented on - so like and comment only the type of video you want to see more of. You can download videos you would like to keep. Also you can change any setting under profile. Oh, TikTok collects less data than Google or amazon"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a very great app with videos and music, I really enjoy. But as an android user, i think it's very dumb about the fact that there is no dark mode option. What's the point of giving iOS dark mode but not android? Some android users can go to the settings app and force it by turning on a third-person app display, but some android phones, including mine, can't do that either. I think there's no point in giving IOS dark mode and not android, please, and thank you so much!"

I can't delete the app and reinstall it because the first time it crashed it somehow managed to save it as a draft. So if I delete the app it will go away. And I spend quite some time on this one.

It keeps me logged in for like a day before kicking me out and then I can't get back in. I'm trying to promote a business here on the most popular app and I can't.

The only thing I have a problem with is the organization of comment replies, everything is jumbled up and people miss corrections (due to the inability to edit comments) because it's mixed in with all the other replies. I would suggest a cleaner way to organize replies and comments, possibly a thread like structure for replies under replies. In order to avoid the comment section looking like a program script, I would also add collapsing."

I've restarted my phone, checked for updates, updates my phone but nothing has worked, and I've tried several other ways, it's still doesn't work! Another problem, is that sounds have been removed for copyright issues, but I disagree with this, because I can not use any sounds whatsoever, so I can't make a good tiktok video, this gets very annoying and I need this to be fixed, ASAP!

About six months ago, after an update, the comment section was only visible with a quarter of what it should be. Now the most recent update gives me a black screen, sometimes cuts the used space of the video in half and the other half being black, sometimes does that except cuts the actual video in half. Even more irritating is when it works for the first couple, then goes into one of those bugs."

Now this is 5 ⭐ The app keeps crashing when I click it. The only solution I have left is to redownload it everyday sometimes twice a day. (I've cleared cache, cleared phone from random data, did everything various websites mentioned.) The logo screen appears then swipes itself to the right. Edit to add: it's been doing this for a few months now and it's slowly getting worse."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have been using this app for a few years now and never had a problem with it. All of a sudden, they started to mute some of my videos because the songs were 'copyrighted'. The songs from those videos weren't if popular songs.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This latest update has made the experience of the app so clunky. I can no longer hide in the comments as the video minimizes at the top, and the inbox has become very weird and glitchy.

It's really annoying to have to favorite the video 60 times for it to work because of the feature that notifys the creator when you favorite it. Either than this constant problem, It's a well working app and it's nicely developed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I hate the fact that you updated the way videos are put into a playlist and the most recent are at the bottom now. Could you change it back to where the most recent are at the top ? Also I don't know if it's just the server but I'm trying to use the search function and it is so glitchy and laggy to the point it flat out just freezes before the video appears playing music where I'm having to exit the whole app because it gets so Frozen and stuck.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"However, there are some missing features that I feel would enhance the user experience. Firstly, it would be great to have a modern trending page within the 'songs' section, showcasing the top trending songs of the day. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include regional soundtracks by official artists to avoid the upload of copyrighted material. Lastly, users should be able to use 15-second clips of any sound within their TikTok videos, similar to how Instagram Reels allow for longer clip"

It used to work but now when I put it in, it doesn't give me any videos related to what I put in.

I am not the only one with this problem, since my friend also has this problem."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Video editing in tiktok is a nightmare. There is no way to split audio tracks, and editing a video to line up with a song is nearly impossible without a huge a mount of trial and error. Additionally the option is there to change the cover of the video, but it isn't actually possible, there is no way to save the new cover only to go back and discard it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Hard to Find Stuff: Sometimes, it's tough to find what you want on TikTok. There are so many videos, and it can be tricky to locate specific ones.

This might not be so good if you want to see different things and explore new content."

It seems like there was an update on 11/03/2024 and today (12/03/2024) my app decides to crash. TikTok need to be more user friendly to Android users (Huawei p30).

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to be a good app, but then the updates screwed it over. They got rid of their dark mode for Android, making it difficult for people with visual issues to see the screen from the HARSH white mode, they messed the comments up, and the pre-post to posted editing ratio is all messed up. Ex: I edit and upload a video thinking all of my text is in the frame when it isn't and half of it isn't legible from it being blurred or cut out. Used to be good, got worse."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"TikTok has many amazing creators but quite the horendous format in which they are displayed. I deleted the app many months ago for the same reason I am writing this review today. TikTok will not let you mute videos unless you pause them. There is a setting that has videos muted upon first opening the app, but you can't play any other audio on your phone. Once you unmute the videos, you can't undo the action. Please add a mute button. It is the bare minimum, and please, let us play our own music."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Please for the love of God change back the video editor format or I will lose my mind. Why would you change something that has a default style in most softwares/apps into a less intuitive way ? It makes no sense. Clips are slow, the app keeps randomly showing me different ones than what I click on, sometimes it breaks and I can't even click on anything"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app isn't well formatted for all types of phones such as the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold3. When I am trying to see videos on the inside screen, some of the videos will only show on half of the screen, and opening the comments will do this to videos that are displayed normally. This issue cuts off a chunk of the video as well. They need to look into this to make it work better for more than just the average iPhone or Galaxy phones."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,No closed captions option for when you want to watch videos with your volume off or low volume. It's hard to watch when you're in a loud environment because you can't read anything anymore. Used to be able to turn captions on but there's no settings for it anymore. Such a poor decision to remove them!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app, but there is a problem to where if I do something like accidentally unlike a video in my likes and then I go to like it again, it just dissappears when I exit or refresh the app. It's really annoying at this point because I've been dealing with it for a few months now, and it never did seem to have this problem before. I tried uninstalling the app and downloading it again, and I've tried clearing my cache to even using a different device, but it all didn't solve the issue."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Yo, this is 5 stars. But you muted some really good videos. Occasionally, drafts will glitch out, and will no longer be accessible to edit or post.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Frustrating and unfriendly user interface. This app does what it is meant to do on a base level, but it makes it very challenging to do basic things such as setting a default image for a video, and editing that image, or your caption and tags, after posting. A user shouldn't have to re-upload a video in order to edit those things."

My account got deleted because I was under the age of thirteen... TIK TOK.. I AM 18! I changed my username, and the app suddenly refuses to work and kicks me out of the app. If this keeps happening, I'm uninstalling"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very bad experience, without any reason ticktok restricted my massage sending and receiving options, how shmeful is it for the user that suddenly he is being blocked for sending and receiving msgs to the loving one, it creates very much irritation to the both receiver and sender so as you are already giving option someone to block somebody if he is messaging irrelevant to someone but what does it mean that you restrict the whole application system. Very bad and shameful experience with this app"

Every time I edit a video, I can't save a draft and so I edit on the spot but the app freezes, crashes, and I'm left half an hour invested into the editing process with nothing to show for it. I use a Pixel phone but didn't start having issues until I started posting 3 times a week. It progressively got worse until now I can't do anything to edit inside the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"App works relatively fine most of the time, except this one major thing. Now idk if its only happening to me, but it has happened multiple times. I try to send a video to my friend, so I hit share, and the correct person. Yet it sends to someone else. I double check before hitting send, it is not my fault. Please fix this. Another issue is you can't delete messages. The option is there, but it doesn't go away for the other person. If you hit delete message, its gone for you, never for the other."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Everything was working well until they started to mute my videos for ""copyright issues"" because of the sound. I used the sound from Tiktok itself and after a few months the sound has been deleted from the app so I have to choose another one. And now most of the videos I post are muted because of copyright issues because there's music in the background. Unfortunately it makes want to stop posting on this app because there's too much restrictions now"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app very much! It's so addicting to scroll and see other people's content, or what's going on in they're lives! Ever since I started scrolling on TikTok, I never went back to YouTube, or any social media! This app only has one problem with the slideshows.. when you even click off the app or turn your phone off, it deletes all of the typing you made and it's been very annoying! I'd be very pleased if you fixed that. Thanks, TikTok! I like creating and sharing educational videos on her"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There's definitely been some issues with the app freezing my phone screen. Just did a restart and now I can't see any of my notifications within the app. I tried to report this to the help desk, after I tried all the recommended ways to fix the issue (which didn't work) and all I get is the ""something went wrong try again"". So, I get notifications but can't actually view comments, likes, etc."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I don't know what's going on but the app is messed up today. It was fine until a few hours ago and now it either won't load a draft, or when I try to post it, it kicks me back to the drafts screen. It's showing me old notifications. I force quit the app, it asked me in app to quit it so I did. I had to log back in, same issue even after restarting my phone. I'm don't want to try uninstalling and reinstalling because I'll lose drafts. Fix plsss"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The editing tools are gone now and all of the good music is too. So many of my videos have been muted after I used the music they have available. I had to dispute a charge w my bank and when I got back on almost all of my videos were muted, even ones that were not copyrighted and had been previously approved and the songs are still available on the app. They definitely target accounts."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Has a number of bugs that support has put in zero effort to fix. If you minimize the app to go into a different one, tiktok will reopen itself if someone messages you. Saying ""not interested"" and blocking certain audios doesn't work, and I have specific tags blocked that STILL show up in my feed. Also now it turns on my phone's volume whenever I open the app and there's no way to stop this."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The newest update feels so unnecessary. The interface feels clunky and whenever I'm trying to repost something it instead shows me a big list of my friends that covers up half of my screen. No one asked for that, the previous interface was great already! Same with the video sliding up when going inti the comments. It's not as annoying but I think most people dislike it based in what I've seen people in the app itself say. Overall, the newest update feels very unnecessary."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Not successful for my purpose. Microphone is off when sound is added. Every time I try to record on Tiktok, the mic is enabled, but soon as I add a library sound, the mic turns red for disable. Only option is voice over but the sound do not play in background while doing a voice over. Bottom line, I would like to sing or rap over a sound from the library but it won't let. Maybe its not allowed, but how are other artist uploading these type of tiktoks."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Almost every single time this app updates (bug fixes and whatnot), it refuses to open on my phone, clearing cache won't help and restarting does not work. Each time, I need to re-install the app no matter what. Another issue is that hateful behaviour is allowed, despite terms and conditions. Multiple times I've reported genuinely awful stuff being said, only to be multiple times ignored despite the clear violation. Otherwise app is fine, good to pass time."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Now app completely loads different pages wonky, like weird sliding effect. What is that supposed to do, other than be infuriatingly excessive! Still has a lot of flaws. App can be highly unstable at times; freezing, lost connection when there is plenty of service, no Dark Mode for Android when there is supposed to be, etc."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"So I love TikTok it's a great app but recently there was an update and now the screen spins when I push tabs in the tiktok shop?! Uhm absolutely not the screen shifts when I click into my profile as well as individual chats. Edit: So turns out tiktok added ""transitions"" to the tiktok actions and there is no way to turn it off it's absolutely horrible it hurts my eyes."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Recently bought the Galaxy Z Fold 5, and this app struggles while the phone is unfolded. At times, videos get shifted off the screen to where you only get to see half of it. If the video opens correctly and you open the comments, this can shift the video off screen and never return when closing the comments. Additionally, if you accidentally click to recharge your coins, the only way to get out is to close the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Update: The app is still pretty good, but there's a persistent issue with logging into all my TikTok accounts. Whenever I log into an account on TikTok, it always says there's no internet connection or that I've exceeded the limit. I recently got a new phone, and it's still doing this with all my accounts, even though I've reset the passwords for them. Please fix this in the next update, or people won't be able to log into their accounts."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app has a lot of flaws, so please listen up. Everytime I press the dislike button on a video that I don't like or I'm not interested in, those videos still pop up. And when I press the dislike button on an ad that's useless to me or something I don't like, it doesn't work. And Tiktokers are constantly uploading offensive videos and videos that aren't supposed to be on this app, I report every single time and those videos still show up. I'm not sure if it's a bug or not, but please fix it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app but it has flaws. For me, the app keeps freezing and going mute. It also freezes my whole phone. If I try to leave the app, I have to power off my phone before going on anything else sometimes. And it lags so much. It might be my phone, though, I really don't know. Make it work for other phones, not just iPhones. The app can't function unless it's the only thing on my phone. It needs to be fixed. It's taking over my phone like a virus. Also, too many ads and pop-ups. Fix it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Too many issues. Went to upload a video, it came back completely black with audio, no video. Saved my posts to my phone as just black with audio. If I deactivate my profile temporarily, all my posts are marked as ""Violating guidelines"" I lost 50+ posts because of this and haven't been motivated to pick up the pieces by making new posts. You don't truly enjoy this app unless you have money. I've lost interest in TikTok. What a hassle."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Honestly it can be a fun app but if you don't already have it DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT! it's very toxic and the algorithm is rigged. There's no quality control and if you don't like a video and press uninterested it only shows you more of that content. People say that it's the same as any other social media platform but honestly it's worse, at least Instagram doesn't keep showing you content that you specifically tell it not to show you. All social media platforms are terrible but tiktok is the worst"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"10/31/23 Still unable to see what filters are being used so I can use them. But now, for the last week, there's a bug/glitch going on. I'm either unable to scroll after 10 minutes or if I do get to scroll it's the same three videos over and over and 90% of the time it's useless ads. Tiktok is broken. 1/19/24 new glitch, if you pause a video, after a few seconds it will start playing again."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Lately it's impossible to upload videos. It constantly crashes, freezes, I've lost my drafts and now it literally can't load ANY video I have ""Sorry, something went wrong"" literally all the time. Also the ""not interested"" feature is hidden? And the app keeps on showing me stuff I couldn't care less about or that goes against my beliefs and interests"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Something went horribly wrong with Tiktok, for 2 days now the algorithm changed and i keep seeing content that I don't like and I never interacted with (and never saw before). Spent some time hitting the Not Interested option but kept seeing the same type of content. Went from barely seeing 2-3 videos from my country per day to only seeing those and cars and kids. Even reported issue to tiktok and nothing. Seems I need to find a new app and only use tiktok for the few I followed before this"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Worst customer support I've ever had the displeasure of experiencing. For almost half a year, I've been completely unable to log into my account due to an error. The last time I sent a ticket, customer support essentially said ""Okay but have you tried logging in?"" in a response that was almost certainly AI, and promptly ghosted me afterwards. Don't even bother. Genuinely."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The algorithm is hit or miss. Either it reads you right and gives you everything you want or it gives you whatever they want you to see. Other than that, my only complaint is that when streaming on smart TVs and things like Chromecast, there is no audio leveling and I'm constantly changing the volume."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app was fine, until I tried to make an alternative account. First, when making a nickname, it kept saying ""You are editing too fast, slow down"" so I had to skip that step. Then after changing ONLY my username and nickname, I tried to change my profile picture, and it said ""You've edited your profile too many times today, try again later."" What in the actual hell is that?? It's a new account, OBVIOUSLY I'm going to be editing it a lot. The setup process is absolutely flawed in every way."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The main issue that I have is that downloads go into the camera folder. On any other app, they would go to internal storage/pictures/(name of app) or at least DCIM/(name of app) but TikTok just puts them in DCIM/Camera which is extremely annoying for organizing my pictures and videos when they get mixed together. Please at least include an option to change where downloads are saved!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,You can watch lots of videos but sponsored ads and regular ads are mixed into the point that they count as regular ads. You can't really get through videos without it being more than half ads. It's definitely gone downhill very quickly. It used to be a lot of interesting content. Now everything seems to be taking you to the tik tok shop so that you can buy things suspiciously cheap. It makes me wary and feels like Temu which I would never give my card information to.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"recent bug is that a lot of time I will tap on the app on my home screen and it just refuses to open, it will make the animation that its opening but then only flash a white screen and immediately close. this does not happen with my other apps. Sometimes I have to restart my phone just to get it to open once. Other than that on my android phone making tiktoks is completely impossible and the app kept crashing so I just gave up and only watch. Otherwise, I do enjoy the app.good apps tnx tik tok"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been getting so many spammers as well as spyware. That has come from this app. I. Also, I don't understand why this app does not function correctly for me. I have the latest updated version, space, ect, but for whatever reason, it does not post my videos if they're over 3 minutes, and it also does not save to my drafts. So, all the effort I put into editing my videos. TikTok just throws my effort down the drain. If it does not improve these issues I will be deleting my account"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Their website is unusable. I can't stand developers who force you to download their apps. Privacy concerns and the entire GIGABYTE this app takes up is so not worth it. I don't even use Tik Tok as much as I do snap/insta but at least they've got desktop sites where I can view on my laptop as well. Lastly I keep telling the app to NOT connect my friends via #...yet it doesn't listen. Do better Tik Tok.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok, the music app without music. Thank you UMG. Tiktok became even worse after the newest updates too. Not a fun experience when it keeps lagging, not posting stories, messing with the notifications and not posting videos. On top of that, it has a habit of logging users out of their accounts, for reasons unknown."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So after a very long time the major problems like the certain fixed elements within the application, such as the prominently bright ""For You"" letters at the top and the plus icon at the bottom that where contributing to screen burn issues on phones where kinda fixed by opening the comments those elements go away and you can enjoy the videos in peace without worrying about your phones screen. Still, the lack of a dark themed mode in the app is unexceptable in the year 2024."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Stopped letting me upload videos correctly. It would show the full video in the selection part but once I tried to edit the video it would only upload a couple seconds of each video. On the rare occasion it would let me edit the video it wouldn't upload more than the first 10 seconds even though the video should have been a minute long. Tried to get help from TikTok but they didn't reply. Uninstalling didn't help nor did restarting phone.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm still waiting for issues to get fixed,getting very frustrated with tiktok i'm still not getting any notifications from the ppl I follow,as my settings are set to all notifications but nothing shows up on my phone or on the app. It's not fair when I miss post's & their lives,also now all lives on tiktok keep lagging or freeze & i have to restart app. i'm just tired of this app not fully working,each update new problems please fix as soon as possible thanks."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It has been a nice app however recently, it's becoming so RAM GREEDY ,uses almost 2 GB ram to startup, random crashes, Secondly is twice as data consuming as before . Phone freezes on opening it. Sound library is not that appealing too. It's lite version seems to work smoothly than the original."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Usually enjoy this app and making videos but when you find half of the sounds removed to the videos you spent time making, makes me not want to upload and post videos anymore cos it's just a waste of time when they mute the sounds. Sucks big time. Also videos are freezing when trying to edit them. About to uninstall the damn app it's so frustrating!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"don't get me wrong, I've had tiktok for over 4 years now, and its great! I just absolutely hate that they keep getting rid of helpful things, like comments on reposts, pinning comments, etc. I also hate that you can't search up slideshows. Its really unhelpful. Ive tried to search certain ones up multiple times, and all i get is videos of people screen recording them, and over time it got really annoying. please add/fix this."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Tiktok is a great place to be i can Express myself. And have fun . On this app. It allows me to talk to all of my friends. And i love to cosplay as well 😍💜🧡 I hope that tikdoesn't mute all of our videos. I heard what happened and I'm praying for a way that will allow the app to continue to let us use audio and music. This is not right. We should be able post what we like and continue to Express ourselves.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tik Tok Good experience overall. I only need some more editing tools. Sometimes it's tough to select specific cuts of the audio I chose as a track to adjust how loud it is at given moments. I haven't been able to split the audio track to do that. I'm enjoying the experience but would love to know how to make sure my audience is reached. I'm a Portuguese speaker, but traveling abroad. How do I make sure Portuguese speakers find my video and how to make sure it gets recommended by the platform?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I miss the app tiktok used to be. Now there's ads that will pop up during a video that your watching. Three times now I've had a video basically ruined for me because an ad cuts off the end. I find it crazy that started happening as soon as people started blocking the shop hashtags. TT developers if you're listening the ads are too much it takes every drop of fun away (I'm sure you don't actually care anything to get that money right) the app is trash!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's not that good I just go up there to look at interesting tiktok videos so really nothing wrong but it is kinda laggy and the video editing doesn't work at all I wouldn't say it doesn't work but it isn't really appreciative so I would say put in a work on that video editing. Also about the lagging it's a pain to try and look at the video. And when the videos are laggy I can barely even scroll. But, all I know is that it's not that good of a app and I do appreciate this app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Recent bug is that a lot of time I will tap on the app on my home screen and it just refuses to open,it will make the animation that it's opening but then only flash a white screen and immediately close this does not happen with my other apps sometime I have to restart my phone just to get it to open once.other than that on my android phone making tiktks is completely impossible and the app kept crashing so I just gave up and.only watch Otherwise,I do enjoy the app . good app @mandialy0"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's owned by China, so it's super laggy, low quality streaming, good app, but it's owned by China so it has the low Chinese quality with it, the latest update made the lag worst and now the app just stops working at random, freezing a lot, poor costumer service, terrible coding and layouts, but a nice app to use, the app just needs a new owner and company to run it, the app is getting worse and going down hill fast"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I don't know what's happening with TikTok but I'm scrolling through videos like any other day and suddenly the video that is supposed to be showing goes all black and the only thing that goes on it's the audio playing in the background it happens over and over again. I know it isn't my wifi cause I have a very stable connection, I tried uninstalling the app then reinstalling it again but it's the same thing, nothing changes. It's very disappointing because I enjoyed this app a lot until now."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Usually, this app is great. However, right now I'm trying to purchase several items through the TikTok shop for the first time. The items I chose are usually $6.99, but the seller has a deal for it to be $3.15. Awesome, right? WRONG! I added 5 to my cart, so you would think the total would come to be $15.75, right? WRONG AGAIN! It comes out to $31.45. What I've noticed is that it keeps the seller discount price for ONLY up to three items. Any more and you pay normal price. SO WHAT'S THE POINT?🤬"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Does not open when I press it, it always rejects and when it stops refusing, it froze along with the other apps that froze as well. I had to restart my phone to work (it's not my phone this the problem but the app that is damaging it). I would rather save my phone than to break it by pieces from a ridiculous error in the app. Do what you can to fix it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,8 months ago my TikTok started loosing major features... the ability to edit.. use filters... use sounds... etc. Several friends have had similar experiences. No matter how many times we have written & requested help from TikTok...none of us have heard back. We have all tried to erase & redownload many times. Some friends have left the app now & I have barely any basic features left. I suspect that TikTok is made for iPhones and anyone with a less common phone gets issue after issue.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Don't know what's going on, but I can not see the comment section. All I get is black screen, and I can only see half videos. Some videos are cut in half (screen not length), and finally I'm seeing the same videos over and over again. This started happening after an update. It worked perfectly before. SAMSUNG GALAXY FOLD 4"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've had a pretty good experience so far on TikTok but I'm now running into an issue. It was working normally until I deleted it and then reinstalled it. It now won't let me long into my account saying ""no Internet connection"" when I have a clear connection. I've tried uninstalling the app again, restarting it, restarting my phone, clearing the data. Nothing is working and I'm pretty bummed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It is annoying, I'd open the app and they'd just show the black screen, and for the next 5 minutes, it's still loading, I can't use it to do ANYTHING.. It's just taking up space. I updated it, hoping that would change something, it didnt, I'm updating it again. Nothing changes? I'm done I officially hate this app, just used over 100mb updating it for nothing to change... Uninstalled"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok is great, but I don't have many updates that other friends have in this app.....I tried everything, and I had an excellent connection, and I tried updating the app but still didn't get the swipe photo thing in the camera, it didn't get the messages update which you can send messages to a friend on tiktok. I want these features in my tiktok account, so I want a solution to my complaint."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app TikTok is very slow. It closes suddenly. When I used it for the first time it was seriously fun using it. But now it is slow and hangs so much. Everytime I open the app it gives us the option TikTok is not responding. And closes down and the worst part comes when I sit down to make the TikTok. It often hangs and closes. I seriously feel irritated.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You guys are a music app, so I can't understand why you'd take the music away when it's literally the main concept. 90% of my liked and favorite videos are muted, and multiple editors, much like myself, are forced to delete their videos. It's so upsetting when you spent hours on edits that get great reviews on it only for tiktok to mute the music."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It glitches a lot and there way too many adds, I go to swipe my 4th video and there's an add! Every 3-4 video u watch there is usually an add after. And I'm not a fan of how lives are shown on my fyp bc when I try to pause the video it always ends up being a live and then I just click on to the live, it's very annoying. But overall the app is pretty okay."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When people try to share a video, this app spams with pop ups that completely make it unwatchable and is not friendly user. When I finally get pass this pop ups, it takes me to a completely different video. If you want to make it easier for people to watch, get rid of the stupid pop ups. Make it easier for me to watch a video, at this rate, I get it to work, I kinda lose interest .I'll stick to YouTube where it's been easier, thanks!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Video thumbnails/previews quit showing About a month ago I lost the ability to see video previews on any profile, to include my own. lf I go to a creators profile to view their videos, or even my own profile, each thumbnail is blank. I have to physically tap a video and scroll through each to view the content. I've tried clearing cache, data, uninstalling and reinstalling (which fixed it for about 5 seconds) to no avail and there is no update available so that is not the issue either."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Makes my phone lag like hell anytime it's opened, or if I even get a notification. Uses an alarming amount of storage. I installed yesterday, followed one friend with 8 posts, posted nothing myself, gave no permission - and somehow have 1.56gb of ""user data"". Never experienced anything like this with any other app. Makes me concerned with what it's trying to do in the background."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Way to many ads and can you for the love of god add a mute button. Update: thank you for allowing the app to be opened muted but i would still like to see a mute button. Also please send ""live"" video feeds to their own tab. I hate having ""live"" feeds pop up on my FYP. Now i see more ads then before. Please make it so you can opt put from ads."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Mostly good, enjoy fun facts and funny videos. My algorithm could be better. It used to be right on point but now all I see are new filters and stiktok shop videos it seems like. Yes I've done a good bit of shopping but that doesn't mean I wanna go to relax and watch ad videos. Also, they could 3ase up on the giving you bad points for cuss words, they are words... They express emphasisism when used correctly. Other than that it's good."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app was fine until it started getting rid of all of the sounds the app legit used to be called MUSICALLY but now all we have is silly budget songs I had a song on my video that was from MY LITTLE PONY and it got taken down due to ""copyright"" reasons? That's silly bring the sounds back. Me and a lot of other people have videos based around a specific song but nearly everything good has been taken down which is stupid fix this TikTok there was absolutely no reason for it"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"great app honestly, it's really fun to watch and make videos. I do have an issue though - in videos where there's CLEARLY an effect being used it doesn't display the little button that has the effect name on it if yk what I mean, then when I try to search for the effect it isn't there. if this is because of the device I have then it's stupid as hell because I have a brand new samsung phone. please fix this issue and also make dark mode available to samsung users 🙏"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Created an account a few days ago, and haven't been able to use the app whatsoever. App crashes constantly, freezes when trying to scroll. I cannot follow, like, or comment on videos at all. Every account I follow immediately unfollows after refreshing the page, and all my likes immediately unlike once I scroll. What's the point of joining if you won't let me use the app whatsoever?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When I close the app to do other things the app will pop up and reopen itself randomly. Getting spammed with fake ""you are selected as winner"" accounts. At first all my reports came back as not against their tos but now they're just ignored. Also they direct you towards an unhelpful FAQ and at the bottom it says ""is your problem resolved"" and the no button literally doesn't work. It's not a button. Only yes is a button."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There are so many flaws to this app's system and formatting. The only thing that makes it good is the community of people creating content. To name a few issues that I notice the most: the search engine is inaccurate, I can never find videos again unless I like them, the unwatched button doesn't work, and the app reposts videos randomly on my account."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,TikTok automaticly opens videos that it thinks I might like. I hate all of them. It sucks up over 600MB of user data containing God knows what and several hundred more MB in cache. I clear storage frequently and it still uses almost 500MB program storage. Could easily be reduced to half that size or less. A glorified video player doesn't even need that much. The only explanation is that the Chinese spyware requires all the extra resources. It's most certainly not user oriented functionality.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Useless after the update. I cannot log in via username. You put in the password, complete the authentication, and then it just makes you put the password in again. Top of that, my videos are disappearing? I post them and they're completely gone within less than 10 seconds. They're not getting flagged for community violations to my knowledge, they're just getting pulled. I even tried reposting a video that is currently on my page, and the same thing happens. Bricked."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The sound keeps going up every time I enter the app even tho it was turned off beforehand and it has not been very pleasant as there were times when it was supposed to be quiet and the volume just went up. Other than that the app is ok. P.s. there are some filters that do not work on my phone model which is a bit annoying.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE NEWEST UPDATE! Used to love the app until The new update made the transition screen spin... genuinely considering closing my account because of it. And having photosensitivity turned on does NOT change it. They give the option to avoid videos with flashing lights but put it a potential trigger that can't be removed. I would give no stars if I could. Very disappointed
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The newest update feels so unnecessary. The interface feels clunky and whenever I'm trying to repost something , it shows me a big list of my friends that cover up half of my screen. No one asked for that. The The previous interface was great already! Same with the video sliding up when going into the comments. It's not as annoying, but I think most people dislike it based on what l've seen people in the app itself say. Overall, the newest update feels very unnecessary."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"NEVER DOWNLOAD THIS! This app is so bad. The only ""good thing"" is watching videos. When I try and use an effect, it will ALWAYS say ""This effect doesn't work with your device"". Even when I have a strong internet connection, It says that. Also these bots that send you to 🧡🖤 websites. In my inbox I'm flooded with 99 notifications. When I think I finally am famous, all I see is ""Hannah😘🍑, liked your video."" My point is that you should beware of bots and bugs in the app before you download this."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Was working fine until the recent update. I've been having problems with commenting. When I try to post a comment it will randomly only post part of the comment, or if you hit the wrong person to reply to, your comment bar freezes up at the bottom of the screen and won't let you close it. Have to close and restart the app, and even after doing that, it still does it every time I want to comment on something."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is addicting and I can't stop watching it and posting but I'm going to delete it and just try not to re download it. The cons out way the pros. Its addicting, it bad for MH for many reasons, nobody cares that it's 13+, the algorithm sucks, there are countless bugs that never get fixed, if your video gets reported and it's not a viral video then they take it down no questions asked but I still see really inappropriate viral videos . And there's so much more I can't even fit. Dont do it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have been on this app since musically and I love it so much. Although it gets addicting it's a great way to pass the time I love to make and post videos as much as I do to watch them. My tiktok account is tudorfacts__ or Maddisons.main2. I can not explain how much I love this app. You can even make money from this app if you wanted to be an influencer I highly recommend checking this app out it's amazing xxxx
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"IDENTITY FRAUD!!!! This app has poor features your identity can be duplicated or stolen. App has several defects. Causing delays, but it's OK for connecting with people. My issue now is the latest update has huge delays I can't login"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Everything was fine until recently, now the app says no Internet connection when everything else on my phone works fine. I've updated, restarted phone, everything. Tried reaching out to support tech and that was a joke, told me to do things I told them I already done, then told me to report it on the app and never heard anything back. Update: Heard back from support and it's the same message over and over ""try switching from wifi to mobile data"", I don't have cell service at my house!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I use this app often and there's these weird animations when you click on notifications/dms/etc. One is like a very quick PowerPoint transition like one tab flipping in front of another, and another is a pulsating animation that lasts about 3 or 4 seconds. It's very distracting and makes me motion sick, idk if this is a new update or something but I can't find a way to turn it off in settings+I'm considering uninstalling because of this."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App will not open. There is no cache saved to clear. I have uninstalled and reinstalled several times, restarted my phone etc. The app will not open.

I'm continuously reporting the problem and tried all the suggestions and my videos still are not loading. This is happening to someone else I know as well.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There is no use in choosing your interests when you first create an account because it DOESN'T show you any of those stuff. It immediately gives you random videos, and then you have to keep putting ""Not interested"" on those random videos to try to find the one video you do want, which you need to interact with so you can get more of it. PUT not interested in videos you don't interact with as well or more will pop up."

Also I can't use many different filters, like I'll see filters on my fyp but I'm not able to use them. Another thing, it's really annoying how a lot of sounds and popular audios are being muted and removed. But other than those things, great app, kind of addicting ngl, and I've met some cool people. Overall, w 🤫🧏"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The only social platform that updates regularly, staving off glitchiness, while not be obnoxious about reconfiguring everything forcing its users to entirely relearn how to use it each time. As always, spot on algorithm, relaxing a bit of content restrictions and phenomenal from the source world news/events"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Very interesting application to interact with friends through both video sharing and live video conference . You can watch past and current trending news and videos of what is happening in the surroundings and abroad. It's a user friendly application which is simple to use in uploading nice videos and pictures with its built-in brightening effects and filters too .
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's like every time there's a new update they add something random for the commercials. Such as of course phone promos and now it's to download movie or series app. The worst part about these movie apps they are very disturbing. Having to do with SA or SEXUAL CONTACT. THAT'S ONE WAY TO KEEP ME OFF OF THIS APP. I wish there was a way to turn off commercials but unfortunately there isn't. Tiktok has been able to make me feel uncomfortable ONCE AGAIN. Thumbs down if I could write a zero I would.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Ok. It's a good app. It's fun to post on and watch lives. But I no longer get notifications from lives that I set for every live to give me a notification. On one of my accounts it didn't even show ppl were going live and when they were live it never showed. When I join in the app it won't let me like the first vid I see and if I try to text someone I have to leave the app cause all the messages are tubbled up and backwards.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I do like Tiktok as an app, cause the videos are relatable and funny, however I had to delete Tiktok off my phone because it had messed up the operating system for some reason. My phone would reset by itself, and I could be randomly doing something on it and it would just crash and reset itself again. I wouldn't be able to even open Tiktok because it would crash instantly and my phone screen would be frozen. I had to factory reset my phone multiple times just so I could have a functioning phone."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app works smoothly, and everything looks good. But it's really annoying that after years Android users still can't use the app on dark mode. It was added on Apple around four years ago and we are still waiting, it really makes no sense. I hope it won't take much longer until we get access to such a simple option."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"with all due respect, this app had a huge downfall in all ways possible, this used to be a music app, dancing app whatever it was literally called musical.ly when it became tik tok it was fine at first but this past year and a couple of months ago it became horrible, first of all removing half of the sounds ever made on tik tok due to ""copyright""??bffr.. copyright was never a problem before but all of a sudden it is? second of all the animations/transitions in the app remove that bs."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Seriously fix your app I have non stop issues between my whole screen doing cartwheels and flips, I'm not even kidding or exaggerating I wish I was, to my cover photo/clip never uploading and saving, every video I have posted in the last two months won't post with my chosen and saved cover, the app changes it to the default cover. Either make it fixable and possibly to change after it's been uploaded or fix your app. It makes my page look terrible and makes me not want to post on your app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"TikTok provides a captivating platform for short-form video content, fostering creativity and diverse expression. Its user-friendly interface and algorithm-driven feed enhance discoverability. However, concerns about privacy and data security persist. Overall, TikTok offers an entertaining experience but warrants careful consideration of privacy implications. I just want to give a suggestion can you put banners for profiles in the back ground please."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"MALWARE!!!! Keeps moving out of the folders that I put it in after device restart. MALWARE!!! Also won't even update itself unless I tell it.

And ads are malware, try taking control of the device without authorization. And the ads at malware too."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There are so many flaws to this apps system and formatting. The only thing thah makes it good is the community of people creating content. To name a few issues thah l notice the most: the search engine is inaccurate, l can naver find videos again unless l like them, the unwatched button doesn't work, and the app reposts videos randomly on my account .(Thank you)."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I really like tiktok but when I search anything the first like 4 videos that pop up are about what the search was but after that, the videos aren't about anything what I searched, but something random. Also when I click on the second video of my search, there is a video before it but I can't scroll back, I have to click off of the video and click on the first one specifically. Tiktok really needs to fix that problem because I know a lot of people who are frustrated about it, but overall it's ok."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Just spent over an hour editing a video in tik tok, for it to crash randomly as soon as in done and loose absolutely everything I had done to the video.. ... Why do changes to your video disappear if you record more? App gets access to your notepad, and other information in your phone. Not safe, don't use. Why can't you watch to tiktok on a browser, why do you need the app? They're watching you. And why does TikTok always notify me about black content? Racist much? ????"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Like I have tried using it but it's too active and very slow. The app is OK but it's always reaching too much and is very slow. This app really makes my phone very hot and shut down .I wish they could fix the slowness and acting up for all software.

It also has a problem where whenever I try to open TikTok it just hangs and kicks me out and says ""TikTok isn't responding, close app?"" but it doesn't happen to other apps.

Why is the audio removed on a video where I used a trending sound for ""not meeting guidelines"" when it is allowed on others? Who knows because there is no assistance to be found."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app is absolutely horrible and unprofessional. I was wrongly suspended from sending and receiving messages because of false news which I did not do. I was sent a message about only being suspended for a day and yet it's been more than a week since then. I am now unable to send and receive messages. Please fix your problems and stop being unserious ✋🙄
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My FYP is currently broken - I've been getting only irrelevant content the past 2-3 days. Selecting ""Not interested"" doesn't do anything useful at this point. Refreshing the feed did not help. Searching and liking relevant content doesn't help, my FYP algorithm is still broken. I've been using TikTok for more than 4 years and this never happened before, not even when i changed phones. The app is useless to me at this point and I can no longer use it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,App was glitching badly. Im assuming it potentially sent messages to people I do NOT know. I never intended for any messages to be sent to anyone (mainly because my account was for viewing purposes only and had 0 followers and 0 following). Do NOT download unless you want Tiktok to glitch and send potentially embarassing or even inappropriate messages or videos to people that you do not know. And the worse thing is that content can be sent to private accounts that do not accept messages.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Love the app but having an issue seeing the content creaters I follow. Can only see that section if I sign in and out of the app. I have to do this evertime since I had the update. Tried restarting my phone, Uninstaller and reinstalled. Doesn't work. Really annoying"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app keeps on glitching and froze. I never had this problem for years. Most of my videos sounds gets muted due to copyright, when I actually got the song from the app itself."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I do not like this app anymore as I have had 2 account that meet the age requirements and I'm older than 13. It has deleted both of my account and I don't know why. I make a new one and it will already be suspended and a few days later it gets banned and I think this is a problem that needs sorting out quickly because I can't be bothered with it anymore. I barely go on it bu when I do my account gets either suspended or banned and it's not very helpful. So tiktok needs to sort it out fast.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You are so passive aggressive. ""Couldn't play video"" and ""your network is unstable;"" just say you need an update. Also my latest video has been up since last night and has zero views. Low views I would believe, but zero, I think something might be wrong. Also it says I've seen all the new content I'm Following, but my For You Page is showing new videos from people I follow."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"No feedback from creators. No response whatsoever. Pathetic really. 3 reviews and nobody could help or even send feedback. Screw this. Why have an app that's taking 1.3G space, and don't even work although you upgrade everytime it needs an upgrade.... Worst app I've used so far. Don't need tik tok anymore. Plenty of other apps do the same thing🤷 R. I. P tik tok. Not for me anymore"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I broke my old phone and am having to sign in on a new device. I don't have access to my old phone number it keeps saying my email and password are correct but signs me into an account that isn't mine. This is devastating as I've been using the app daily since 2019 and it's becoomee part of my daily routine. Very frustrating.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app becoming more worst by time and depening your region, when I am in the South america i keep getting funny video. When I am in Europe i keep getting religious video, war in and not funny thing. Annoying how the system work...also for every comment you need to write it carefully cause system flagg you. You cannot even put certain emojis. Other than that will not recommend it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I still can't view any live streams on tiktok. I've reported it multiple times and heard nothing back. Any creator can be live but when I search there name it only shows videos posted with no option to view there live or even that they are live. It's not just for 1 person it's for everyone. All live streams have disappeared off tiktok for me?
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I switched to iOS to android over a year ago, but TikTok doesn't add dark mode? Do you think you can ""fix"" bugs? You're actually not doing it! There is no way that there is no dark mode on android by now! Please add dark mode right now! It not that hard! My eyes are hurting, and the battery is draining because of you! If I could rate this app zero stars, I would! I want it to be banned for not adding dark mode! This app deserves 1 star."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ever since I've gotten a new phone the favorites button is gone. I've tried trouble shooting all the tips from googling this issue. Nothing has fixed it. It's astonishing that this garbage app has had this issue for years and they haven't fixed it still.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It used to be great until TikTok shop took it over. You won't make it passed two tiktoks before seeing another one. They have an option to search solely tiktok shop but still insist on having it 90% of everyone for you page as well ...

I have an issue though where it says that you can edit the caption and then the next day it says you can't edit it and I don't know why. Can you help me fix it pretty please? I also would love it if you add a feature to where you can change your pictures, videos and the songs after it's posted."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is going from bad to worse with every update. Don't see the translate feature under videos anymore, don't receive notifications for comments and replies(even with the notifications settings turned on), and a new update with video links; they have added this ""Your friend shared this video with you. Watch it now!"" text before the actual link. What is wrong with ya guys? don't like things just working fine that you have to mess'em up with unnecessary useless updates? Fix these issues"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Great app but my account lacks photo mode regardless of what I do, if I somehow find a work around, the next hour I've lost it again. Relatively impossible to post slideshows because of it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"These apps are no longer good as of now because almost all the videos have no sound. It's good that the real artist who created the songs himself is not complaining, he should be proud because the song is getting more people to listen to."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Nope. It wants access to my photos, documents and storage space just to share someone else's video. I'm uninstalling, but it will probably never be a complete uninstall due to maleware, etc. I don't understand why anyone would allow the Chinese to take control over their phone like that."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tictok refuses to do anything about the buttons on the bottom being constantly visible causing burn-in. This happened to my last phone. Last night i found out they also have pages, like showing videos out of messaging, that prevent your phone from timing out the screen. So this is the second phone ive gotten burn in from just using this app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app worked great the first times i downloaded it but theres a bug in it, when i dont open the app for a whike it starts to bug out and when i try to open it, it closes gain again and again yet theyve done nothing to fix it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This app messes with my whole phone. It makes it glitch out and turn off randomly. When I open the app now it turns my volume up to full and I can't fix it. The type board is horrible I'll be typing and it just disappears and then when it appears again I type something and then it just turns off the whole app in general. The support team on tik Tok is horrible as well I've reported issues and they have not been fixed at all.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"App is amazing however it says I can't use certain filters because of the region I live in, yet my friends have it and live in the same state as me and they don't have a problem at all, and the filters used to work for me but now they dont and I never changed regions. As soon as this gets fixed I would love to change this to a 5 star review."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok is a very good app, I enjoy it very much! But there are somethings that are overbearing, I cannot create a playlist no matter how Many times I update the app and even though only the lucky ones get to be viral the flopping is too much!! Ive been on this app for three years plus and each and everyone of my videos flop! Honestly I think its time to uninstall lol but apart from this tiktok is a great app!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I just got this app yesterday, when I first tried to post something, it didn't work. it just brought me to a black screen and it said it couldent load the video. then when I go back to my account. The video just dissepears. I can't change my profile picture as well. it says I've edited my profile too much. So now I have a blank pfp. i also can't follow people without it breaking or just not following them. I can't send messages and such either. this app sucks so far. I'm probably deleting it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Since loading it, it will not let me follow anyone and even when you click on follow friends, it never shows up that you are. The follow button disappears but as soon as you go to friends it's empty. No matter how many times you try to follow or add them they never show up in your friends list. Even when you get a follow message and click follow back, they never show up. So what's the point."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This is a very great app but it is very stressful when I enter the app and I tried to watch something or edit some videos it's just kick's me out like it's very stressful and I have been dealing with it for some time now and I don't know if it's glitching but other than that the app is great it has very funny videos and I love that
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The ""nudge"" thing was a dumb addition. Ads on the following page are awful. Video and audio unsync, this has been happening a lot on live streams. Can't block sounds when they get annoying and they keep showing up after hitting ""not interested"" every time. Insane amount of bots and scam accounts, this is a serious issue. So many fake accounts of bots stealing content, when one gets taken down then 5 more pop up"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app itself is good you can post and watch videos get advice,learn new tricks but every time I go to put in a text, when I'm putting the text down it's fine but, when I post the video the text is either small, stretched our or bigger and it's really annoying hopefully it gets fixed soon!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I use Tiktok a lot, and it's alright. What gets me is when I go to check messages from friends and the UI has these weird transitions that makes me physically sick and gives me a headache. I've shown friends screen recordings of this happening and they claim that it's weird and they don't have that. I'd love for this app to not give me a headache and make me feel sick."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Would give it zero stars if I could. I literally deactivated the option where we get notified if our friend comments on a video that we liked and I still get those damn notifications all the time??? I even reported the problem and nothing worked either. I'm NOT fixing the rating until this gets fixed and until I stop getting those notifications. Will also rate it 1* with my other accounts if I don't get feedback as soon as possible.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Been using the app for a while and all of the sudden I get reported and it's preventing me from sending and receiving messages , I requested that they review this as I did not send anything weird or offensive but no response. Not worth downloading the app rather use YouTube shorts atleast they look at evidence before blocking or restricting certain functions"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Hi there ticktock, I must say this is a good app, but on the honor phones, basically I opened ticktock, and I couldn't faviroute any videos so I went to the play store and updated it, I went to open it again, and it would show me the loading screen then kick me out. Just un-installed and re-installed it, I can now get in, but I still can't faviroute videos! I've checked Google play for any updates, but my app is all up to date, please fix this!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,A good app but it has now decided that I cannot open it. I click to open it and it immediately closes itself. I updated and even restarted my phone and the issue still persists. Had many different issues over the years.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Direct massaging is not available for no reason since 3 weeks. Tiktok is not helping to resolve the issue neither answering my reports all ik getting is generated answers that say ""thank you for loving tiktok"" which is completely irrelevant and so disrespectful considering my long explanations of the problem with provided screenshots. Very bad service for such an big application. I cant have the full experience and many people have the same issue. Instagram better."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"10/10! By far my favorite social media platform, I really don't have an negative comments towards this app other than sometimes I cannot find certain filters or songs, I do not like the fact that it mutes certain songs, please consider this, but overall, I love this app!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok is the absolute best social media platform out there, due to their algorithm designed much like Pandora, the more you heart, the more of that type of content you get, so you often get content you enjoy! But it's also not as annoying, frustrating, or angering as most other social media platforms, They have the sweetest, kindest, and most supporting communities there! since I' ve found tiktok? it's changed my life!l' ve learned so much and I ve healed from a lot of trauma Thank!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Useless only for dummies. NO black screen! Invisible small buttons, complex and small fonts I upload my own videos with my copyright but even recording a video is useless. Then, you put your own voice and songs with YOUR voice recorded with YouTube account and they banned it ALWAYS. As an artist, I have to say, I found it frustrating. *Update 2024: I finally left the app last year! Btw it needs bigger and better fonts. Not improving."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It takes a while to open the app, then it's a while to upload a video etc, it seems slow. Today I have tried a handful of times to open it and it restarts my phone. I have deleted pics, videos, uninstalled apps and still having an issue"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's an amazing app, can't be watched offline but if you save the videos you can watch them on your gallery. Got a wide range of videos and content for a wide range of personalities but it doesn't make it look nice by putting any inappropriate content on FYP which is quite disturbing. If your kids was watching tiktok like 5 year old idiots do, when they shouldn't be, thats when it's bad but there my only concerns and agreements."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I rate this app 3 starts due to the fact there is no way to restore you lost videos,(some people put a lot of effort into them) and the fact that it takes about 70% of your storage on your device and the fact you can't save it without your use name save all over it. There was one point you could but doesn't look like it anymore"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Extra movement with the new update when swapping from videos to settings or friends DMs is absolutely irritating to look at. It's unnecessary to have extreme movement when opening someone's DM, or opening an video from the DM, or closing out of settings/DMs. Remove this feature or at least make it an option to disable this extra movement in accessibility."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Whatever updates theyre trying to make right now are horrible. The app glitches out when I try to follo someone, it will automatically unfollow, I can't read any new messages in the TikTok shop part, ill see the notifications for new messages but when I open them nothing at all shows up. But when I back out I can see part of the message in the preview window, click back into the message and nothing shows. And video views are terrible. Let's not even talk about views 🙄"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Why are all the sounds with music in being deleted? Wasn't this app intended for dancing? It's practically useless without music furthermore about 80% of the videos I have saved are EDITS which need music. Furthermore the content I usually post are edits so without music this app is totally useless and I wouldn't recommend it if there aren't any music options.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love TikTok. Except the fact that it crashes often, while I'm LIVE and I switch to another app to do something real quick. I should be able to switch apps while I'm LIVE and come back to TikTok without having to reload the entire app again, just to join resume my LIVE. Also, I'm hardly getting viewers whenever I'm LIVE. There's a promote option, but I don't like the fact that I have to pay to get more viewers. I used to get hundreds of viewers when I first started going LIVE."

But it's kinda getting slow nowadays and my phone keeps getting frozen often. Hope they solve this issue fast. Otherwise best video app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"For an app that tracks so much data, it is incredible how little the algorithm and systems learn of my preferences.

It says there's a bug and to try updating if the developers fix it. It just crashes the moment you click the app. Also why does it have to save videos in the default camera app? Why doesn't it get it's own folder?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Keeps seeing other tik toks listed as other creators. E.g. A Chris Olsen tik tok will play, and it'll show the Smosh tik tok account as the uploader. It's not a stitch or anything. It's a glitch. I have to swipe to the actual creators profile to watch the actual tik tok video. Based on the example I gave, it will actually be a smosh video. I've tried closing the app and updating it and / or hasn't fixed the problem."

I have been trying to contact support for help, but no one could help me, and then they stopped responding. I still can't log in.

I have also tried to make a new account, but it says my email is already taken."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Editing effects or changing sound can be labour intense, changing speed of video or adding sound and sharing with friends is hard to find on the app. Finding creators in a certain field can be hard to find. The outlay should change to help find options for changing downloads. Tagging people and getting the word out can be costly when promoting a video. No warning that the video is going to be blocked and or violation or strike is added a little too harshly. Hard to go live."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,So i have been using the app for the past 2 years... I am a paramedic and i love to post our response videos.... Nothing dangerous just an ambulance going to a call... And then it gets removed as soon as it gets popular... But girls can be showing their clothes less bodies and videos can be posted about people being killed but that doesn't get removed....
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Good app overall but theres a bunch of things that annoy me on the user interface. One things thats annoying is tiktok doesnt always show the date of the video im watching. I think that affects the algorithm of my prefs and potentially skews view counts cuz i have to refresh the vid a couple times. I don't mind a feed that varies uploaded dates, but id like to kno how old the vid is im engaging with. Also the live notifs still show me notifs for people i disable the notifs for."

I have been locked out of my account far too many times and sometimes it just wouldn't let me in so I have to undownload it and then Redownload it and make a WHOLE NEW ACCOUNT so all my likes videos are GONE. It takes a while for your fyp to be stuff you enjoy but once it is, it's a breeze."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I haven't been able to follow people for months and I tried every fix before reaching out to support. Told them none of the fixes work and the response I got was an auto response telling me to try the fixes I already explained didn't work. Told them it was still not working, they didn't respond for two weeks, followed up, they gave me the exact same message and told me to try the fixes and send a video which I had done almost three weeks prior. Support is useless and the app is barely functional"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app. I feel they need to be better with appeal requests and things like that, as it usually takes months for a response. And the repetitive adds are absolutely annoying, it shouldn't be one add every 2 videos. Otherwise the app itself is great, there's most definitely room for improvement though."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"5 stars for recognition but it doesn't wanna work on my Hisense U60 or maybe it's for specific devices like iPhone I update it everytime the update available trying use it , it doesn't work at all sometimes it's open freeze the video afterwards it will automatical log me out."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"my fav feature is pretty much useless now. I don't know what happened, but now after maybe 8 related videos on search, there is a random feed having nothing to do with the search. There will be more videos related to you search, but you won't see them while you're scrolling on it and it is very frustrating if you're trying to see very specific content or learn more about something. Almost makes me want to delete the app tbh"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The videos are barely playing, it takes like 3 loops for them to play smoothly. It also takes like 3 trys to actually scroll to the next video. The audios won't sync with the video. Then, it'll just randomly go black and close out entirely! I thought i just missed a few updates or something, but no."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Really annoying bug, There's this thing where I'll get told by my friend she sent me videos on TikTok, so I go to check and there's no videos?? usually, it loads or I have to restart the app. This time it's bugging so bad that it wasn't even sending the videos I sent and it spent time loading, no matter what I did, restart the app, restart my phone and even redownload it, it just does the same. Please fix this frustrating bug, I'd greatly appreciate it."

Still you have unfreezed my video, no one is watching it, my video is not being shared anywhere. Since when have I been making videos, none of my videos get views.

Now it has turned into a shopping app. There's to many ads and every other scroll is a live that's pretty much home shopping channel. To many fake accounts stealing other content, content is recycled on the fyp, app keeps pushing to get in contact with others and creates and more content is being censored/blocked. Can't use tiktok anymore I miss the old tiktok"

""Connect to internet and try again"" I am connected, sounds like a you issue. I've done everything everyone suggests, cleared cache, restarted app, switched to cellular data over wifi (which I shouldn't even have to do because both have full bars) might as well go to instagram where people re-upload tik tok content. Tik too is mostly ads and shops now anyway. First aid beauty is officially on my ban list now."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is great and all but there are a lot of bugs (at least on my phone) where i'll like a video but it won't go through, or sometimes it'll say there are no likes on a video but 1,000 some comments. I'm currently not allowed to log in because it says i'm banned, but i'm not. I can easily log in on any device besides my own phone, i've deleted the app and waited a few days, i've powered off my phone and restarted it, etc. It still won't let me log in."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"For some reason the filter I use on tiktok, the most basic one: Green Screen isn't appearing on my new galaxy flip. Along with a bunch of other ones. It's so barren that the trending page only has one supposed filter! I've been seeing reviews here that the tiktok support team said some filters are not available on all phones... What? It's amazing how that makes no sense to start with but the basic green screen isn't available on a galaxy flip but is working on my pixel?! Stupid!"

It's not AI at all, literally just me capturing the screen while I draw in Photoshop. There's seemingly no way to appeal this or submit it for review by an actual human, and I know I'm probably losing a lot of potential traffic on my art due to that AI tag."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of the application, as it shows such a variety of the human experience. It feels like what the internet was made to be. I understand the algorithm pushes more of what's interesting to me, yet, I am still able to search for other things and have them shared with me without it becoming the only thingl get or marginalized. it's not bogged down by multiple commercials and advertisements, which, in most apps, take away the enjoyment of the experience Irfan ullah"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Although the ability to have my messages filtered is nice, it would be significantly less annoying if it were actually possible to find and view the filtered message requests.

Why? Just doesn't work right. Today 07/16/2022 insisted on my birthday. Not doing that so not using anymore. Just recently stopped working all day today. Keeps flashing on my phone Unavailable back soon. Reducing to 2 stars til this gets fixed. It's fully updated.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have had this app for a long time since it was musically, the only reason it's not 5 stars is because I can't access the newer voice changers like trickster and such. It also deletes videos halfway through recording if I'm trying to do a transition of some sort. ****Update**** everything works fine now 5 stars"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I just updated my app and I have been using it for years this phone it's been installed several months. I have been uploading videos from my cell. Now it tells me go to settings to allow permission... ALLLLLLLLL PERMISSIONS ARE GRANTED and yet it still keeps popping up go to settings to allow access.. it says all access granted!!! And I had just uploaded a video before the update... and all my accounts are like that.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"apps worked fine for a while. however, no matter how much you can complain about a feature, it doesn't seem to matter. removing the comment feature on reposts, not having dark mode available for android, moving the repost button 50 times, and now the copyright update. this app is BASED on music. cosplayers, dancers, singers, editors, they are holding tiktok up singlehandedly. trends happen via MUSIC. taking away the entire purpose of this app is useless. DISAPPOINTING. make your app WORK."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"1. Reaching out to support about profile issues garners no response. Very discouraging as an aspiring content creator. 2. Uploads in progress should be able to be cancelled as an upload could be a mistake from accidental taps. Once it's uploaded, I can no longer edit a post and have to either leave it up or delete it with no way to get back that content. 3. Shadowbanning occurrences are also discouraging to creators. Creators shouldn't be penalized for bot accounts following us. Fix it properly"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Not sure when it started but the algorithm is using cached data to feed you the next video. We're talking about accounts you follow. The catch is your cache data is outdated, so you don't see your followers new videos or the time line is bad. Not sure how you plan on fixing using outdated cache data vs actual server pulls to supply your users with fresh correct content. This app is starting to be a very poor experience for every user."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I do like the app besides one Issue in the past, It's rlly fun & addictive. My only Issue Is that every now-and-then It glitches & I have to uninstall It then reinstall It awhile later & It works again. A bit Inconvenient but I can live with It."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app needs a lot of work. the algorithm is not currently functioning properly, most people's videos are automatically labeled AI after uploading, and I have an issue with two accounts being linked to one email, which has gone completely ignored by support even though I've tried reaching out. They need a way for users to talk to a real person for account issues, especially since many spend real money on ADs and promoting."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"That's great to hear! TikTok's ""Use this/any template"" feature indeed offers a convenient way to create diverse and engaging content. It's fantastic that you enjoy exploring various categories like art, videography, photography, and sharing your voice poetry. Keep having fun and expressing yourself on the platform!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"For a music app, you would expect that the users within the app would be able to use music, but die to current events all music has been pulled off of the ap making people delete videos, views fall dramatically. And for creaters feeling left confused and panicked about what to do. For a music app this needs to be fixed ASAP and off not them your users will start to Detirate rapidly"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok just randomly stops loading all content. It's just stuck in a loading loop and at first I though it was my WiFi or something so I rebooted it and that didn't fix anything. Not to mention all other apps (YouTube, webtoons etc) is still working. And then also a vast majority of the audios have been removed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Great app, I love all the relatable funny , and useful content on here,but sametimes there are problems that occur that are really not supposed too, I don't know if anyone else has been having the same problem as me, but my recently every time I like a video from my fyp, it doesn't appear on my profile in the liked videos section'l tried refreshing multiplayer times,l don't have to update the app because it doesn't need to, and I have cleared out any other tubs that may be open on my phone"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app rolls out some cool new features at the pace of a frozen snail. I've seen some users with dark mode for over a year hoping that with the next update I'll be able to read comment sections without issues and still no dark mode. 1/13 Every new update comes with bad PowerPoint transitions that nobody asked for or wants that you have to submit help tickets to get removed.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love using the app Tiktok mostly every day of the week. It is a good digital app because I can edit videos or photos of mine to make it more creatively for the audience to get more views up to 1M. I can even pick your music effects ir style to go with my content of the video. I really want to achieve more likes than other followers by posting more photos within the week.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is very good itself, the uploading is very quick, it depends on the internet ur using, but it's normally very quick, it's very easy to get ur head around if ur new to this app... Ig I was wrong about this app But one thing... The things ppl post on this app is ridiculous... That's why I never rlly ""liked"" this app, therefore there has to be a better way to remove those cringe a*s videos pls... Maybe do that instead of banning this app completely!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is very addictive with an incredible algorithm, the only downside is that tiktok is very strict. Please make the moderation less strict. - EDITS: As we can see in tiktok video trends alot people love listening to TIKTOK AUDIO, it would be a great idea for tiktok to make it a MUSIC APP! This app would be used as social media and listening to music at the same time. I'm pretty sure EVERYONE would love this update and by super hyped about this!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It was excellent until some software issue prevented me from recording videos. The screen goes black and none of the time increments work. I've updated, changed my phone settings, and restarted my phone. None of it worked. The ads the instant I open the app are annoying too because they lag when closing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is completely broken on the inside screen for the galaxy zfold 4. The videos show up halfway off the screen, opening the comments shove the video ALL the way off the screen. The entire UI disappears too when this happens. I'm not going to open this app until it's fixed, it's seriously unuseable. Uninstalled/re-installed, still broken."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,So the issue iv been having is that i use Samsung and whenever I try taking videos with my phone the tiktok camera always automatically brightens the video it makes everything lighter than it is and I have no way of fixing that my camera is decent but I put my face in let's say half the screen the video is decent the colours and my skin is fine when I put my whole face in frame my face is brighter and everything looks horrid you need to optimise your camera app not to do that
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I don't have the repost option and when I go to settings then privacy there is no repost option and when I delete the app and reinstall it the repost button appears for maybe 30 min then it disappears so if u can help me fix this it would be a perfect app bcs every thing is already perfect 🥰
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is very iffy, but I think the only issue I have with it atm is the fact that it's very demanding when it comes to storage space. If you don't have at least 1gb of storage space, there's a good chance you're going to have difficulty with this app either in downloading, getting it to run, or getting it to run properly."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It will attempt to get you to befriend your contacts, even after explicitly not giving permission to connect them. Wayyy too many bots who can just add absolutely everyone to their friend list and I have to spend time out of my day removing or blocking them. You can use the ""filter keywords"" feature but it will still show you videos with those keywords so why even try"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Whatever updates are being done has messed up the commenting features during like. I also noticed the COPYRIGHT thing on your videos. If we have to change the music, why can't we get rid of the wording on the video? The words of the SONGS no longer match up with the words on showing on your videos. There's no option to erase them."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"TikTok has been glitching lately a lot like it often says ""no internet connection""when my wifi works perfectly fine it's kind of annoying,I I just want to watch some videos,even if I restart my whole phone it still doesn't work and I don't get why, I'm always confused like what could I be doing wrong?? I hope it'll get fixed❤️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app and fun as well, I would give it 5 stars if I didn't have any problems following others because every time time I would follow someone and either refresh the screen or leave and re-enter their page my following would disappear, and I don't if anyone is having this problem or if it's just me but I'm starting to get a bit frustrated about it"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The update that came out yesterday is full of bugs!!! I can't even comment on a video without it freezing up, then I have to close out and try again. After about 4 times, I can finally post a comment. Also when toggling between pages, it's glitching. FIX IT!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app used to be incredible but as time goes on it becomes increasingly clear that they have tunnel visioned themselves down a hole trying to make the app more profitable. With more than half of all popular songs ever made suddenly missing from their catalogue, I believe that every day this app will grow more useless and provide less dopamine until it's a shell of its former self that nobody can enjoy enough to be addicted to. I'm deleting it because I can't use beabadoobee or the sundays"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is decent,addicting and relatble.now tiktok is good but my proble is how it seems to remove an update to add another one and the ones seem to be removed after an update are always the most usefulones.for example lets take the front flash light was taken away for an update literally nobody is even aware or grateful for. It always seems to glitch too and lags when l want scroll down on video and then it brings up "" Tiktok is not responding"" 1.Close app 2.wait viery annoying."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is one of the most annoying and useless that I have downloaded in my history of using smart phones. You get a daily assault of, what seem to be bots, asking to follow or friend. The app even has a built-in feature to corral these requests to a special area in the app to deal with later. If you do comply to the request and there is a person chatting with you, they seem to not know that you can create a profile to list your basic information. It just becomes tedious to continue to answer."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New algorithm sucks. For the past 1 to 2 weeks my fyp has been nothing but ads and lives on topics that I have never shown interest in, and clicking ""not interested"" does nothing. And just now I opened the app, and it says my account has been PERMANENTLY BANNED! I haven't posted a video in weeks, and my few videos are of my cats! F.U. Tiktok. I'm DONE."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Well, it was great when I was actually able to use it! Will not let me log into my account on my phone. It keeps saying ""Maximum number of attempts reached"" I even tried creating a new account, and it won't let me. Good luck contacting tiktok for support. They'll just ignore you till you give up. I put in the ticket several days ago asking for help and have received nothing. Not even an email that they were looking into it. I'm giving 2 stars because I liked it when I could use it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Liking too many toks can lead to a forced lockout of liking them for a while. When listening to a ""collection"" of tiktoks on the ""favourites tab"" it struggles to load past around 60 eventually reaching a cap of 60. Additionally the same load limits can be found using the liked tab and repost tab. Due to this categorising ""collections"" which have more than 100 tiktoks is rather infuriating. For ""slideshows"" this application struggles to load over 20 slides and stops loading any more past that."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Did you put ads in the middle of tiktoks??? Cause I'm watching stuff and it cuts away to an ad. I will delete this app. I already get ads like every 3 videos. I abandoned YouTube for the many ads I will leave this one too. On top of this I'm getting the same tiktoks playing multiple times I had one 3 times in 2 days. Sometimes I back out of the app and restart it cause I get multiple videos I've seen already in a row.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall one of the best apps I've ever used, but I do not get slideshows on my FYP or following and I've tried everything but it does not work. Aswell I cannot use the repost button and it only works if I uninstall and them reinstall the app, and only works the first time I open it. I've had this app since 2019 and it has always been like this. Fix it please."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to use the app all the time, now with the new update I cannot switch between screens because the animation, which I cannot turn off, gives me migraines and makes me nauseous. I cannot view videos friends have sent me, look at my notifications, or view video comments without triggering this animation. I will be rarely using this app now, if at all."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am well aware its spyware built into scosial media. The way it uses an obscene amount of storage, how it slowes down even the newest phones.. but what has really made it painfully clear was getting flagged for being underage, then it asking for a photo of my ID or my credit card information.. I let my account go inactive. No thanks. Great platform for alternative news and learning but if you uninstall it you'll notice a huge difference in the quality of your battery life and overall speed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app in overall is amazing, but I have some suggestions: Please add dark mode to android devices. Give us the option to filter more than 100 keywords on the content preferences. Gives the option to organize a little bit more the saved and liked videos. Those are on my opinion the best additions."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"App is great, but I experience that same bug over and over, my following page don't show up, I only have for you page, when I change account it's fix but it comes back after I close tik tok app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It's an okay app. It's not really my cup of tea and I don't use it often. But one thing that bothers me is when my friends send me a lot of tiktoks and everytime I reply to one I have to scroll alllll the way up to see the next one they sent me and it's very frustrating. I wish if you could click on the message you replied to and theyd automatically scroll up to that message so you dont have to scroll manually. That would make my experience much better.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I had TikTok for a very long time. And it's been working really well but recently I had an issue with the app itself. I can't like videos. I can't read comments. I can't hear my sounds. I tried Restarting my phone I tried getting out of the app and going back in the app And yet nothing has happened So please fix this issue
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I worked so hard to edit a video, and I tried to post it, and it isn't eligible for the for you page, probably because it's a little hard to see. I feel like that guideline is too harsh and very unfair, as I would see other videos way much blurry on my feed. It isn't fair for content creators because it's not our problem that a clip comes out blurry on your app... my clips were not blurry until I posted the tiktok."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app, although it's weird how some features aren't accessible. I've compared two of the same phones, one can post slideshows and the other can't. Would be cool if all the features were accessible on all devices. Great app overall! Gets the job done."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's an amazing app 😍 but I used to be able to do sideshows where you can pick a photo and swipe but I can't anymore,as it doesn't let me pick and choose to do one 🥲.And on the other hand cannot do stories and post stories anymore,deleted the app several times looked in settings updated the app several times aswell no answer from tick tock though.Would appreciate it the world to if any of you could kindly tell me some tips because I really want the slides and stories back.Other people can.Xx🤲"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It is a good app but for some reason they always want to take and mute music I use or silence it saying copy right but I notated in the video that I do not own the rights, etc. I do not see anyone else's videos being muted when they use music/songs that they don't and they do not notate or give credit. I think I am being singled out."

And it won't let me search in the search bar to look for them. But on my second account, all the same filters are on there. And just stuff that was on there before ain't on there it's very weird TikTok, go back to the old update.."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Tik tok has removed a lot of their translate features, I used to be able to see videos in other languages, and tiktok would have the auto translate features in their closed captions.. I really wish they would bring that back. Don't understand why they would get rid of it. Better experience recommendation is to offer the user to see what language videos they want to see (checkbox all that apply) and then develop translate features."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Is pretty laggy and has an attitude no matter what device I'm on. Lives are atrocious because you can never scroll past them without touching then and then breaking your whole phone. Stuff likes to just pop up in your face and you accidently click it causes your phone to break again and swiping between for you and messages takes ages sometimes. As well as just scrolling through memes. Other than that, the content is funny. I don't like that there are limited words for comments but I understand."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Completely broken at this point. Ads every third swipe, alot of music suddenly gone and now when you try to like something it'll suddenly try to pull you into a random persons livestream. Let's not forget aswell that it completely steals your personal info and sells it even if you opt out of data collection. Genuinely disappointed that whenever something exists today it has to turn into a cash grab where everyone's trying to use you to make as much money as possible."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I could not add pictures to my drafts. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Now, every time I click my profile, I get kicked out with a notification that the app is updating. I have automatic updates turned on...

Everyone I know can do reposts but I've been able to only do it one time and I've never seen that button to repost ever again, as well as the whole ""your tapping too fast take a break"" even if it's just after liking almost 20 videos I've had to make a favourite collection just to go back to the videos I couldn't like the other day. Please get rid of that and fix reposts."

There is no way to search your watch history for a video you forgot to like or save.

How can someone post videos and the videos don't go viral & this happens every time. I started using this app over 3yrs now, but non of my videos have reached 1000 views, but other people keep having a lot of views. Why is my own different. I have done all I could, every time I keep resetting the app, but the same thing keeps happening. Infact, am done with this app. Pls @tiktok make my videos go viral. Thank you😊"

There is no possible way of changing the download location apart from sd card and phone storage.

By example, since i created my account (around 1 year ago) i haven't been able even once to repost any tiktoks which is kinda annoying. And sometimes i just can't watch tiktok at all and message anyone."

Tiktok used to be my favourite apps but I don't like it that much now because before I didn't have any problems, hopefully tiktok fixes this to get more ratings!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I don't like the new update to where you can't see if they saw ur DM or not bc sometimes I don't know why they won't answer. Also after I got banned for no reason it wouldn't let me follow anyone back. I don't like how they're already getting rid of tiktok when tiktok is one of the most popular apps! Like stop gun use and not get so revolved over an app!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Annoying most times. Takes time for stuff to load. My network is good but I'd be watching a video and it will just stop as if it's loading but it never loads. I have to scroll up or down, come back to the video then forward it to the place I stopped before it continues."

Always thought Chinese Woman were pretty, but these Women are far beyond that. It's almost like they were Created in a Lab Somewhere, but not where they Sprang the Virus!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app used to be good but now it's a joke. All of a sudden the sounds start getting removed from your videos because Tiktok arent paying the music industry enough. It's become difficult to upload our own sounds and then even they get removed. Tiktok sort yourselves out. Stop removing good audio!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Good app, good program, good development, good media. But does TikTok personally unfriend? or unfollow it friends list or which of it. If I add friends it's shows me unadded again or they are be removed from my friends list and I will still have to add again and again..... Pls make una try kip d program well. Pls fix issues on ground thanks"

People with gutairs, electric guitars, violins, and all the other instruments talented people play with their audios GONE."

They keep on jumping back and forth to other videos I had not clicked on...it's always been this way since a few months when I told myself maybe I should subscribe to Tik Tok AND get the app...mistake.its only making my phone slower ans slower evolution react. BTW I am on a 2014 Samsung Galaxy S4 or 5...not sure. Thanks!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Everything is perfect but one thing that has annoyed me and overtaken me into giving it 2 stars is that the search facility is useless as a whole, even when I search the most precise things (keywords) the video I am looking for doesn't come, only the videos in my region shows up (with similar but different keywords), I am super annoyed with it"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Hallo TikTok If your TikTok ID isn't garnering the views you expected, there are a few strategies you can employ to increase visibility. Firstly, ensure your content is engaging, unique, and relevant to your audience. Experiment with trending hashtags, catchy captions, and eye-catching thumbnails to attract attention. Consistency is key, so try to post regularly to keep your audience engaged. Additionally, engage with other users by commenting, liking, and sharing."

Is that if im doing it you can't stop me, because im bypassing what you're using to stop me lol. and you may not even know how it's being done... it's not worth it for me not interested in the app anyway"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The app is great well kinda When you open the app it takes long to load and most times the pictures take longer to load so you only hear the sound and it makes the app boring since you have to wait for 30minutes to an hour before the app can work properly
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app does what it's supposed to do mostly. It shows your video for how long they are and you can scroll on. But the like feature for me is gliched. Ever since I deleted my old account my new one has been unable to like certain videos. I've sent many requests for them to not answer what's so ever making the support team practically useless. Tiktok please fix this.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"All in all, this app is very good for you to watch, I have been getting regular sponsored videos and stuff and it gets every video you need, I also keep watching the same video over and over again. A lot, it's usually a sponsored video for some reason or a video that I find interesting. Even if I don't watch it completely or interact with it, it comes back."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like the app but theres some problems -many unnesesary updates- they often ruin the experience when nobody asked for them -the deleting account procces. I think you should be given the option wether you actually want to wait the 30. Also the fact that if you havent waited the 30 days and want to use the same gmail account it automatically renews it -The ""not interested"" button not working especially with live videos -adds, even if youre looking at someones account -optimalised only for iphone"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"it's been like 3 years why is there no dark mode like it doesn't take 3 years to add a feature like dark mode. *Update* It's been maybe 5 years now, still no dark mode, EVEN SNAPCHAT FINALLY ADDED DARK MODE!! TikTok is unstable as hell, takes up a lot of storage even without any drafts, after deleting cache and history. AND ALSO REMOVING REPOST COMMENTS WAS SUCH AN UNNECESSARY THING TO DO, LIKE THAT WAS SO UNCALLED FOR, WHO ASKED FOR THAT???"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love the app just one or two things. My account was fine until about a week ago when all of my saved filter were gone. I did some research and it looks like I have to change my location but in my settings there's nothing to do that. Just a bug I need fixed.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love tiktok so much it's a great app,and the fact that you can get instant views a few seconds after posting. But I really wish you could create on option where it tells me whether your video is eligible for the fyp or not before posting not after,it takes up so much data Editing in the tiktok app is wack as well...It really hurts being told your vid is not eligible for the fyp after hours of editing"

I personally havent got an issue with the following tab but im here to tell you that there is an issue with it. other than that, this app is mid, 3 stars :p"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ya'll need to fix the bug's in this app. Always freezing up and make my phone go bonkers. It's not only my phone a whole lot of people and different styles of phones says the same thing. And this updating the app every time we turn around is getting ridiculous as well.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've had the app since 2021, I love watching it 24/7 and posting my own stuff but recently tiktok is taking away sounds from practically everyone because of ""copyright"", if the sound is there for anyone to use then it isn't copyright. Another reason that comes up is ""the content creator hasn't made this sound available in your country"", what has my country got to do with using a sound, if an admin reads this then I'd appreciate it if you could try changing this because it isn't fair really is it"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,great app. a lot of people are toxic on there and the filtrring system is awful. i saw someones bikini area and reported it and there was no problem and it left the video up but when i made a message that was about 4 400 word paragraphs on a video about me quitting that account it got taken down when i didnt say anything bad about anyone/anything. (edit) kind of annoying that all the good sounds got removed and i had to delete over 50 videos.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"App used to be fine, workable, etc. Recent update added a transition visual effect to opening comments/posting videos that causes flashing and spinning on the screen triggering photosensitivity. Nausea inducing to try to use, please fix or give us the accessibility setting to turn it off at least."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"man I love it, but the UMG song removal is insane. as said in the about tiktok on this very app below category 'About TikTok' it says 'Discover videos, music, trends, LIVEs and much more from our creator community!' . . . buddy we can't listen to half the good music since it's been REMOVED. and also I have this on my google pixel and slideshows just don't exist on my phone. I want sounds back urgently!! and power for slideshows pretty please with a cherry ontop.❤️❤️❤️ (my fav edits are muted.)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's okay for the most part but suffering from chronic migraines my phone has everything in dark mode except for this app because it doesn't offer it. I recently switched from apple to android and just a bit disappointed that tiktok doesn't have dark mode on Android. Definitely should bring it back or update it to allow dark mode.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This may be the legit buggiest piece of software I've ever touched and I'm a software engineer so that includes half written apps. How is this a major platform? I can't even follow accounts. Help page says to clear cache. Doesn't help. Same thing happens on two different phones. What's the point of a social media platform if the most basic function of it is broken? Go back to undergrad.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Very entertaining and monetizing app, but please differentiate between friends, followers and following. Friends shouldn't be included in following. We have to be able to go through following list without seeing those we're friends with. I'll drop another star if it's upgraded. 🤩"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"When tiktok first started nearly in 2018, it was more fun, categorized , searchable , eventfully, and trendy. It used the new internet technology ; real-time based I'm not sure what the term is for it. It was more fun and graphiclly modern. Cyber, whatever u You wanna call it. HOLOGRAM"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is great and all, but I've been having a current problem where I click the follow button to follow another user, but it doesn't work. It keeps telling me to follow them as if I hadn't already clicked the button to. I've tried everything, including creating another account to follow the people I want, but it still doesn't work. Please can something be done about this!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I had to create a new account with my current phone number bc my original account was linked to a phone number I no longer have access to. No big deal. But now when I try to follow people back, it doesn't show that I followed them back and I end up following the same people multiple times to the point where I get put in ""tiktok jail"" for liking too many people at once. Idk if this has anything to do with the new update, but it's very discouraging when I'm trying to rebuild my account."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Have been using this app for entertainment purposes since pandemic and so far no problems I have faced that were deep. Except for the fact that I cannot like any posts at all! I have tried installing and uninstalling the app multiple times and even created several accounts in hope I can have one account where I can place a godforsaken like but apparently that's out of boundaries. I have even put out a report for this exact reason months ago and I am still thoroughly met with no changes. Fix it!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Text to speech voice options gone First few videos I made I had options of different voices to use for my text to speech now I'm stuck with just one dull man's voice and can't change it and don't have the option to. Annoyed. Making me not post content.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok is cool. But I just don't believe only 20 of my 4000+ followers make videos each day. And requesting samples aren't easy, why when I tap the buttons to request samples or closes instead of open when I never tapped anything to close it. It should be much easier to put in a request"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"While I was watching my videos, all of a sudden my for you page turned into something called ""restricted mode"", I don't know why they did this, but Tik Tok please fix this. It is incredibly annoying, because I can't look at my following, lives, the Tik Tok shop, or search anything. And everytime I try to log in to a different account, it asked me for a passcode that they never told me about because of the restricted mode. Tik Tok please fix this it is incredibly annoying."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Tiktok app works fine for a few weeks and then suddenly the app doesn't want to open even after rebooting the phone. It's so annoying and when you delete the app and re-download it then you lose all your drafts.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"As much as I love this app and use it. It's a big inconvenience. They remove features for private messages you send. I was talking to my friend, and said ""inner 9 year old me is coming out"", talking about how when I was 9, I was obsessed with the topic. Not even 30 seconds after, they remove my DMs, and tried to put a screen time on my account. I am NOT 9!!! I am 16!! And they won't appeal my account, I tried submitting a photo with my date of birth on a paper with my mother and nothing."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Its ok. The bright white irritates my photosensitivity. So i dont use it as often anymore. No dark mode on droid is its 2nd biggest issue. Ads is the other. Tho the ads have slightly gotten less annoying. When they make dark mode for everyone I will b back on consistently. For now im sticking to the gram
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I LOVED tik Tok since 2020, but whatever they have going on Now 👀 SUCKS. No good music, my vids that went viral and I had a song on but not actually playing is muted now so the vids are ruined. Editing videos are such a task and I always have to go outside of the app to edit and then upload now. I'm thinking of just removing it"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoy this app normally, but recently the new videos of a channel I follow don't show up in my feed. I've checked with the person who runs the channel and they said they don't see any reason why that would happen. I've updated the app and tried refreshing, but still nothing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ads are 1 out of every 3 posts. Literally. Every 3 posts I see is an ad. ....and they censor stuff more than other platforms.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why do they wait almost a year to take sound off a video if it's copyrighted? Do they just wait to see if you make any money so they can do something about it? I understand the whole concept of it but as many times as ppl make videos with music, why is it a thing? I know it happens in some cases but most of the time it's accidental or just a song someone likes and wants to use. What's the point of music or tiktok of you can't use a song you like. H"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love using the app compared amongst all others. I mean, that's my own preference. I will not know other people's preferences.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Was working fine until I purchased a new phone ( Galaxy S24+ ) now I continually recieve video not available message when I click on links I received even with age restriction turned off. Videos are still available however because I've sent the link to a friend and it still works on his phone. Frustrating since the videos actually aren't even age restricted.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Love the experience, but absolutely no optimization for the Fold 5. I've reinstalled, etc. A few updates ago, they broke how videos are viewed when unfolded, half the time the comments open randomly, and push the video off the screen. I've waited for a fix to no avail."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is amazing. It would be helpful if there was a way to see the videos you liked from the first one. I've liked over 1000 videos so it's near impossible to see go through them all, if there was a way to filter by date or something like that."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app, been a daily user since 2020. However I'm incredibly frustrated that the new update has taken away the ""following"" tab.

PLEASE BRING IT BACK"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"create a feature where you can search through your liked or favorite videos using keywords. rather than having to scroll endlessly through your liked or favorite videos just to find one video. many times people overlook and pass the one video they're trying to find in the long list of liked or favorite videos. sometimes people never find the video because come to find out they never ""liked"" the video to begin with and thought they hit like."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I had this app for about 3-4 years now and don't get me wrong it's great and entertaining especially cause you get to choose what you want to watch and have lots of options for videos your for you page your profile etc... but i still don't have slideshows???!!

People do argue alot in a comment section but people argue a lot offline too. The only reason it isn't 5 stars because, I see people posting pictures instead of videos. I love them but the problem is I can't do it to. I don't know why but the phone I have won't let me. It would be awesome if you could fix this :) but if not that's fine it's still an amazing app!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have been on this App since it had a different name, but unfortunately, the recent changes can lead to a tragic end.

On November 13th, 2023, My account I had for almost 3 years has gotten banned all because I requested to change the date of my birthday after I mistakened the month of it. not only that, but the app also has horrible glitches of making the likes and views of a video temporarily up to zero, and the worst thing ever is when tiktok deletes the best videos and accounts from people I loved without warning! I honestly used to love this app, but not anymore."

Whenever i text trough tiktok everytime, they show me, Due to multiple community guideline violations, you are temporarily prevented from sending and receiving messages. 😔...please do some action against this notification 😔"

Some filters missing, on accident I deleted tik tok and when I reinstalled it. All my drafts were gone! Wich is okay so also don't delete tik tok if you post or just want to save drafts. Some times tik tok acts up but not very often. This is my review hope it helped!☺️ Update: I'm a little slow it says in drafts unless you download the drafts it wouldn't keep them.🙃💀"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app, lots of people and good recommendation feed. I would like them to add the slideshow to the Google pixel platform. It really irritates me knowing that I don't have it and I have to use the video slideshow. But other than that, great app!"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The updates now are just useless aesthetic updates that make the app run worse and worse. They tried to add transition animations between windows and its glitchy, useless, and awful looking. I spend a lot of time on this app, but ever since the american servers have been added, its awful and only getting worse."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Nice app. I love how it brings you videos according to what you spend time watching. It's downside is that it doesn't show the time when a video was posted and sometimes there are complications when you try to post something. Sometimes when you post something it's like it is hidden, no single view"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Edit 2: can't repost videos. Edit: recently, the apps has been having weird transitions whenever I ckick my new followers or activities. App completely unusable, Glitchy. When I say don't show me videos from this creator, it still does. Also, sometimes a random video will pop up on my profile picture that I did not even watch."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app very much! It's so addicting to scroll and see other people's content, or what's going on in they're lives! Ever since I started scrolling on TikTok, I never went back to YouTube, or any social media! This app only has one problem with the slideshows.. when you even click off the app or turn your phone off, it deletes all of the typing you made and it's been very annoying! I'd be very pleased if you fixed that. Thanks, TikTok!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,sound on videos has been notoriously spotty. like new videos that don't have music and are just the creators voices are muted for me. I've cleared my cache and restarted. also some videos that I watched are not visible even though the creator has not deleted or changed video privacy. super buggy
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It will not update no matter how hard I try to get it to. I've tried clesring storage, resetting my phone, everything. I don't know if this will limit what I can do on the app, but if someone could help me out that'd be great."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Redownloaded and tried to log on after multiple years of inactivity to find my account suspended. Assumed one of my siblilings got on my account and said somthing dumb when i still had the app. But thats not the problem the problem is i cant use my account and cant find a help center since im stuck on the log in screen. Honestly probobly killed any chance of me ever using the app again
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Normal use it for my business. But since yesterday I can nk longer get on the app. Jst keeps kicking me of whn loading this is not the first time it's happened and I'm sick to death of having to lose it all to redo tiktok you need to sort out this issue big time
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Tiktok is a good application and liked by most young people but in my opinion there are some actions that tiktok should do for example when I open the camera to make a video I often (not always) find myself in difficult situations because the camera works too slowly but there are times when is screen freeze. A good side of downloading videos or photos is that they are downloaded very quickly in less than 2 minutes. I need an update from tiktok so this app will work better.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"😔The best feature I like most in Tiktok is ""use this/any Template"",s I can edit videos easily with just 1 click s a best way to pass my free time it includes all kinds of good content including art videos,templates,videography, photography, etc where I can get all the benefits of the facility of uploading videos and tutorials of I also speak my voice poetry.Thank you:)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So ever since I went to open my TikTok shop it now automatically kicks me out of tick tok and then I'm not able to get back into my accounts by using my Facebook, Gmail and so on, I have to uninstall the app and read. Download it to get back in. Once I'm able to get back into my facebook account through TikTok it won't let me update my phone number nor my email address. It says that I have no internet connection which I clearly do."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've lost count on how many times I have had to reinstall the app. After a while, it will not open. If I'm watching videos, it starts to hang. I'm using I Mate 20 Pro so performance shouldn't be an issue."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It is amazing you get to pick what kind of videos you want or don't want to watch so you should like every video and their is a password that has to be secure to ensure are safety.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,For some reason tiktok just stops working every now and then and then I have to delete and redownload it again and then I lose all my drafts. This is so frustrating.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I gave it two stars because I think this app can have a little work done. I don't like how it freezes everytime I try to delete my acc or when I scroll because I keep Getting that problem lately. Oh and it's not giving
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok is pretty good, but it has some bad things. Like I can't have any trending filters and after 2 hours, I have litterally 99+ notifications because of reposts, likes, etc."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I really enjoy this app and I use daily. It's great fun. I follow many people and the live feature is very entertaining and I enjoy watching people battle for coins. Except for the occasional crashing it's great.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"i love it and for sure recommend it!!! its just too addicting!!! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 for people who dont really like lagging then this is not for you (laggs, kicks you out of the app sometimes) either way it is so much fun and you watch videos that interests you, it will keep popping up on your feed!! really cool way to interact with people 😁😁"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is great, I dont really have any issues except it is glitching... so... bad. My comments are freezing so that i cant get out unless i exit the app, my comments are sending 4 times?? Whenever i open a video someone sends me it has these weird transitions. It is really irritating to have to deal with😖"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Ever since the recent change with ads the autoplay during a regular video (not while you scroll) I've had so many bugs crop up. I'll come to tiktoks where I hear the sound but the screen is black. Or I'll scroll past one tiktok and the sound keeps playing, stopping the next one from playing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to be a great app until I became a creator and for 3 years never got paid. On top of that every time my followers would increase my total number would decrease, and they would not fix it, that's been happening for 3 years. Example: If I got a hundred new followers, My total number would go down a hundred instead of up. I have over 80,000 followers 3 years ago had 87,000 They have yet to fix the issue. I think I'll take my business elsewhere. Gave them the screenshot proof.. STILL NO FIX!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"No matter what I do, and I've read all the articles and things, it won't let me log in on the app. It keeps saying ""no internet connection"", but I can log in on my phones browser JUST fine. I've cleared cache, I've updated, in uninstalled and reinstalled. It's a shame."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, there's a lot, and I mean A LOT of bad content on this app, lots of cringy creators, ""thirst trappers"", extreme political account, and more, and that honestly can ruin the experience. However, once you finally get around all that and the *holy algorithm* finalizes, you can find some genuinely funny, original, and emotional accounts who fit just your style of entertainment and enjoyment. Just be careful, the bad content is hiding behind every swipe."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Love it but the automatic captioning overlaid over all videos disappeared, and the option to toggle this on disappeared from the accessibility settings! This has been really detrimental to my user experience. I submitted a ticket over a month ago and have received no response."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"every week they change the apps layout I had slideshows like a week ago and now I can't find any? the repost button keeps moving around +you can't add a comment to your repost anymore? tiktok shop recommends me products I have no interest in? you wanna change your app around, maybe fix it, make it so that it's easy to navigate again, make it so that videos don't randomly un-post themselves"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"My videos keep getting muted for having copyrighted music despite it being my music...I'm also unable to convert my page into an artist account even though the creative hub makes it seem easy to do. I'm already confirmed as a tiktok artist but still find my videos muted for using music the app recognises as my own. I'm also unable to use my music as a sound so I can't even tell followers to use the sounds. I've tried numerous times bit still nothing, i need help"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Tl;dr: 1/3 of the contents on the fyp were ads, really annoying. Two big concerns I have. 1. There are some great content creators, and some really bad ones. I hate that there are people who just steal others content and add some stupid subway surfers, diy, or ASMR videos to the side. 2. The amount of ads (as of Feb 22 2024) are horrendous, I opened it up and out of the first 18 tiktoks I saw, 6 of them were ads, legit one third of the contents was ads."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"No dark mode yet! NO OPTION TO SCHEDULE OUR POSTS!!! No option to add more than a song in one video! Not enough sound effects! No 4K in 2024! We can't pin comments anymore! Sound volume bar from video editor does not have an percentage indicator! Some comments are removed even if don't need to be removed(poor algorithm)! Too many ads! NO LIVE SUPPORT!!! And the most stupid thing(ok this is from TikTok, so is not app fault) people can't smoke on Live, you can do that easily to other platforms!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am highly impressed with the app,s presentation as the user interface is incredibly clean and intuive. It effortlessly provides all the necessary information one would desive tosee on their socil account, with abcauitful display of every detail. I tharoughly engoy utilizing this app and express my gratitùde towards the developers for creating such a fantastic application. Thank you for this amazing app . It is truly loved."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Lately Tiktok has been acting up and everyone i record a video it sounds like static and the audios aren't matching up with the timing and it's honestly really annoying and the app kicks you off for no reason and most times I can't like a video with double taps unless I click the heart or unless I exit out the app its frustrating having to do it everyday
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"They've started putting ads at the end of some videos, like every other video isn't an ad. Stop putting so many ads in the app, I understand that ads make you money, but it's getting ridiculous, after every 3-4 regular videos are ads, and now you have the TikTok shop ads, and now after a 30-60 second video, WOW ANOTHER AD."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"1/23/24 I loved this app for info and entertainment but it just started crashing like. Everytime I try to pause a video it sends me to a livestream, and the buttons are out of wack. And also the censorship is getting a little insane. But other than that, I enjoy it mostly."

I've uninstalled and reinstalled and the messages shows up but only for like a minute then they dissappear.... so with this issue I'm giving it 2 stars, hopefully this will get fixed so I can receive my messages"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"A recent update has made it so all captions auto-translate into English, but there is no way to see the original caption, and there is no indication to the user that the caption had been automatically translated from one language into English. This can make it very confusing and has caused non-English speaking creators to get into trouble due to the translation changing the original text into something offensive in English. Please remove auto-translated captions."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, all was well, but now I can't watch the videos I've uploaded! It says, ""Couldn't play video."" It's annoying, but everyone else can play it..... at times, it even does this on other peoples videos. I've tried everything... so if this happens to you.... best of luck!!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok silences the truth. Now can't even shrink the pic, total rubbish app. Went from best app to worst WTH gone from 30 or so likes to 1 or 2 and far less views, stupid little envelope that appears at the top of every post why can't you people leave a good thing alone, tiktok is now worse than Facebook. Well done. and why do companies always mess things up. STILL NO DARK MODE for pixel 7 pro. New templates would be good considering the editor isn't that good."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"TikTok is a really fascinating app, it's content can be very informative and important sometimes. But I can not lie, I wish people that don't have iPhones could also put on a dark mode, it would be better than the previous updates the app has been having (such as removing the ability of commenting something on our reposts)."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's a great app. It just would sure be a lot better if they didn't always remove the music quote to copyright reasons. If that's the case then why do you offer that sound on your sound options to put as a background music to the videos or pictures?
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Ads are starting to get excessive including tiktok shop, temu etc please work on this . We watch tiktock for the content provided not for the ads that are starting to be placed within videos they are becoming consistent even if l it's not a tiktok ad,a creator advertising or attempting to sell something, the app is starting to go down hill it is when it becomes excessive I will unfortunately have to uninstall the app it is for the same reason I refuse to use you tube"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Resend bug is that a lot of time I will lap on the app on my home screen and it just refures to open it will make the animation that it's opening but then only flash a white screen and immediately close this does not happen with my other apps sometime I have to restart my phone just to get it to open once other that on my Android phone making tiktiks is completly impossible and the app kept crashing so I just gave up and only which otherwise I do enjoy the app, good app @mandialye"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is one of my favorite apps but now things was changed, the apps keeps crashing and it has become very slow, I have tried clearing my cache, and it's still not working, and the seed needs to be fixed, I can't even swip up to watch another video,its like app is stuck on only one video and then it just stop"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Just had the new update installed today. Everytime ive gone into the app today the vast majority of it is tiktok shop. I had 13 tiktok shop ads in a row. At this point its not even a social media app, it's just disguised as one when in reality it's a shopping app. Tiktok is rapidly declining UPDATE: I also just realized that the progress bar that is on the bottoms of videos is now gone. So I have to start videos completely over if I don't understand something or couldn't hear what they said"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is good until I have to use dark mode which is unavailable for android but is available for apple products. That is so disgusting, and the bright mode is very terrible for long usage and can damage your eyes because it is so bright and the texts are so small. I can no longer bear it and I'm going to delete the app"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app takes up too much unnecessary space. Every week the stored data/cache is back up to 1gb. There's no need for a social media app to dump this much stored info onto us. It's also being over run with scamvertising. There were issues with p*rn accounts with dodgy links, that seems to have slowed down. It's been taken over by ""Selected as Winner"" bs. It's getting boring. These apps have to understand that as quick as they rise, they can fall just as fast if they dont listen to their users"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the app a lot ,but I wish that you could be able to switch channels while uploading a video on a separate channel. I hope you can fix this. Also my videos dissappear but reappear when I refresh, BUT when I press the video, it skips to another video. I hope you would fix this bug too"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Wow I knew this app was was trash going in but I was not prepared for how bad it would actually be. The auto music on the effects was about to give me an aneurysm and the whole reason I downloaded it was to use the avatar generator feature, but it crashes the app every time I try to open the effect meaning the whole thing is pretty much useless to me. I can see how using this app consistently would kill brain cells and make you stupid. Save yourself the stress and just use YouTube shorts. 0/5"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"fix your issue with the music people and get the sounds back up. you've ruined your app with this, and it genuinely needs sorting, or people will find a new platform. other than that, decent app. just expect half your videos, drafts, and favourites to be muted."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The best featur in TikTok that I like the most is use this any template & I can edit videos easily with just 1click &a best way to pass my free time it's contains all type off good 👍 contents in including funny 🤣 vedios. Templates . Videos graphics photo graphic etc. Where I can get all the benefits for the facility off apploadin the vedios and tutoials by different people thanks 👍 👍
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Changes its features wayyyy too much... Anytime you get used to something or start liking something, it's gone or changed in the next two days. This app needs to learn consistency. The shop is a total scam and almost every item on there has weird prices and questionable reviews that look oddly similar to bots."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok is a stove of treasure. It's an awesome platform to socialize and experience a taste of multiple cultures. Privacy policy is straightforward and feel comfortable on this platform. I would recommend it to every freethinker of all ages. Even the news is given firsthand , better than any news Outlet. Thank you, Tik Tok, for having the best social platform."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Quite annoyed at the fact that most songs sre getting muted, not only that Tiktok has not stated what creator's music are getting muted off the app. Slideshows are unsearchable, not only that they're very glitchy on my side being way up farther than they should be. I tried uninstalling, updating, signing out, and way more just for nothing to work."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A very good app, I just don't like how tiktok censorship makes no sense. Nuts, dead, a leaf emoji can get you shadowban. And the rules will change anytime so it is highly difficult to keep up. Bur the editing effects, song selection and contents are amazing. Been using it for 3 years plus."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Y'all need to fix y'all violations and hop off of me already. Y'all keep taking off the sound on my videos but when I click on the sound there are hundreds of other videos with the same content and no sound removed or anything. This app is just getting worse and worse. Honestly Yt shorts starting to feel better than this whole app now..
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Dang Like when will they stop messing with stuff that there's nothing wrong with now they add a feature where when you fast forward or when you've watched so much of a video and you try to go back to the video it just picks up where it's left off instead of starting the video over like bro who asked for that That's so annoying I scroll past and scroll back up sometimes to restart the video but now it doesn't do that anymore Like bro I can never win with this app It's so annoying
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The algorithm has really messed up. I'm constantly getting TikTok shop ads and brand new accounts that have no views over topics that I'm not even remotely interested in. It has really made things undesirable in the app to a point where I hardly use it. Not only that, but bots are now running rampant and underage TikTokers are able to sneak through. The automated system doesn't do anything to fix things, it just lets this all happen."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"with all permissions disabled it still accessed my microphone and contacts. also with access to storage from day one disable I found in settings, apps, permissions, storage they had save 191 gb on my note 9. I don't understand how they can access parts of my phone without permission. oh and the app has turned in to a place for people to advertise there OF accounts and other ""corn"" sites."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Firstly, when you search for something as you looking at the first related videos it only scroll of that one slot so you have to manually scroll over and over until your at the first video and not just the top of the page. Secondly, the more you scroll in a search, the more COMPLETELY unrelated topics get. Like, yes, I want food recipes, but NO, I don't want to see someone's BEAR FEET. I know for a fact that this isn't due to my algorithm, so please get this issue fixed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I like the app. I upload videos and get over million views but the only thing that bothers me is the interface I really dislike the fact that there is a massive white plus on the bottom whilst watching videos. If only the developers could be able to make the buttons hide so the content could become full screen.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Constantly freezes, audio and videos can break apart where it changes videos but the audio from the previous video keeps playing. Freezes scrolling when you first open it and often crashes. When it works it's amazing, I love the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app was completely fine with my Z fold 3 until only recently when the comment section doesn't even appear anymore and just shows a black half screen where the comments are supposed to be. Not only that, but I am unable to share videos with anyone on my friends list."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After a time of not using it, I come back to my account randomely being suspended with 0 options to appeal, as the only possible contact gives automated responses. I never got an email as to why either. This majorly sucks since it prevents me from using my google account, and it lies about there being no internet connection on a new profile when trying to connect my email to it, with a different one working fine."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"None of my videos have been able to upload, I have a strong Internet connection, I've cleared my cache, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, and have updated it and it still does not. I have attempted to go within the app and view the settings or contact the company but there's no way to get ahold of anyone to help me."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So you've muted must of my videos due to copyright, fine I get it copyrights run out after time, what pisses me off is even when I replace the sound with one I can still use it's still muted, either fix the problem or repurchase the copyright, it sucks that people put so much work into a video just for it to be muted, even after putting a song on it that you allow."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall good experience, but they put restrictions on videos without proper cause. Flag content as barcoded, non original and low quality when it's none of that at all. Other than that it's a good app and great for entertainment and interaction with others"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The ads are out of control. The updates are horrible and rarely get revoked, even though I have seen hundreds of videos complaining. Repost Comments needs to be a thing, as well as fixing the comments back to over the videos. The TikTok shop is a total dcam, and I keep getting videos about products I just would never use. Not to mention, the algorithm sucks and does not work. I click the not interested button and get more videos than before correlated to the video. Litsen to your users."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"One of the more recent updates has caused videos on the FYP to be cropped. I can see on the pages there is more to the video but when playing the videos it just cuts it off. -videos of topics still show up on FYP despite blocking pages click ""Not interested"" -iOS has a dark mode version, but Android does not. -TikTok flagrantly violates Androids privacy policies pulling information about your contacts despite disabling it both in Android and in App."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Whenever i used to post a video, it made the quality so bad! Plus, one of my videos had a warning before you watched it when it literally didn't break any rules. Also, It quite literally stopped me from texting or receiving texts for two or three months now. I've already send my id, but to no avail."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app I've had it for a few years but they ended up removing sounds and it drove me insane I don't edit but I had memories on here with my friends and animals that pasted and they removed the sound of my cat and I or it was my dog and I, might need to do a double check. (Sorry about punctuation I suck at writing sentences)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I would give this app a 5 star, however, since the recent update I have to give it a one. I used to go on here to watch Disney live streams, but now I can't watch any of my friends live streams. And the app keeps randomly adding people on as my friends even when I didn't add them as such. If I can't watch the live streams then there isn't any point in me using this app. Hopefully the glitch gets resolved soon"

Over the past week, nothing has been loading. I'll be sitting next to my router and the videos will be waiting to load like in in an area with bad cell reception. I've never seen any problems like this and I'm considering deleting the app cause this is ridiculous."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is soo good, bar the glicthes like not being able to make a slide show no matter how many times i try to fix this. As there is no button to say if you want a slide show or video. Im hoping tiktok will fixs this as i know alot of ppl have the same issue."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Since the update now when you scroll you can hear the video but the screen is black. My other issue is the ads after the video, why just why. You had to go and ruin it. We already get ads at the beginning why put them with the videos too. Just like YouTube and that's why I don't go to YouTube too much now, ads."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Good app but it always requires an update! And even if it doesn't need an update, it's still so laggy and glitchy! My whole phone freezes because of it! And even without needing an update, it still so glitchy and annoying! Bring back the ability to have a video profile video!!!!!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It keeps freezing when editing and it mixes my captions. For example, for the first clip I'd write something like ""Morning vlog"" then it would move the caption to the fourth clip. It usually does this after I've adjusted (cropped) the clips. It's really frustrating honestly"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Too much junk and ads on fyp. Even on following page, still a lot of junk from ppl I don't even follow. Really annoying. Algorithm doesn't work very well when blocking irrelevant accounts, they still show up. No ad has matched my interests. All I see is TikTok shop ads as well. Also, ANOTHER MAJOR ISSUE: you cannot report an account for stealing/pretending to be another user's account/persona."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There is no picture in picture, background audio, or any way to play a video in the background. Some people would like to go out of tik Tok and do other things but still listen to videos. But I guess that's too advanced."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Half the time, when I try to post things, my captions don't show up. Occasionally, I can go back and edit them to include a caption, but other times I can't! This is so frustrating!! I just tried to uninstall and then reinstall the app but it still is doing the same thing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I got the new update today and it keeps saying ""in tapping too fast"" even tho I'm not. I had to delete the app (and lost all 100+ drafts) to see if it would work with the tapping issue and it did not. I risk my drafts for absolutely nothing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"For God's sake, it's like you developers have bone to pick with Android users. Every feature added has usually been added to Ios first then I on my Samsung phone need to wait a lifetime for it to be on mine, not to mention dark mode. I can't open the damn app without getting flash banged, and I have friends who have had it for who knows how long. How long does it take to invert the color from white to black?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's fun and a nice app to scroll on when I'm bored but lately these updates are getting a bit out of hand. Taking out the front flash, which everyone used and adding random commas? And don't get me started on them removing all of the sounds. They also made videos sit on top of the comments, and it's just annoying in general. I'll still use it but if I get more of these dumb updates I'm uninstalling and moving over to ig reels."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I honestly loved this app when I first got it. I was literally obsessed and so many boring nights were more fun because of this app. But now, like everything else, it's horribly oversaturated with ads and sponsored content. No genuine content creators, literally everyone trying to sell SOMETHING and it's just not the same. Waiting for the next person to create the next big trending app, or waiting for lapse or be real to get more popular. Hate seeing a good thing get ruined..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app was initially great but it slowly started to deteriorate. I watched something it'll say that my account is banned, then when I try to appeal with all my legal documents it says appeal denied. It's so frustrating because I'm 13 going 14 this year so I don't see the reasoning. I just wish to all of my videos back so I don't lose all my progress and hard work. Please work on your apps functions it would be nice. thank you."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Look i enjoy the app as much as anyone else but you can't tell it your screens aspect ratio, so people like me with tall thin phones get the sides of videos cut off with no way to fix - this has since been fixed, yay. Why are comment threads not a timeline? It's so difficult to read a discussion - menu transitions try and do like 3 different animations at once and it looks awful"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is amazing in ways like all things but allowing all these fake pages and allowing people to fake issues with creators page and now the app won't let me block bots, it's not showing my messages, its spinning when tryong to send in issues and wont load. I have emailed and sent in issues with my app and nothing as of yet."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"TicToc gave me alot of grief, when I first tried it. So many catfishing/scam sites. But as I learned hoe to use the app and exchange content with certain people it became an awesome tool of communication for me I've yet to find my partner this year, but I will keep trying!!! TicToc is by far the best app of this kind out there hands down!!! Far better than Instagram or Facebook or any other platforms!! I've had the most success finding real people on TicToc!! Highly recommended 👌 👍 👏 💯 🙌 I!"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Updated yesterday and have a huge issue with the between animations when navigating through the app... It's extremely jittery and jarring, and makes it hard to use the app 😪. This should not be happening considering the amount that goes into development let's be real here..."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I'm giving it a 2 star now because the app is changing and not for the better tiktok was such a good app now it's going down hill I'm a editor and you want to restrict me by removing almost all of the songs and now you want people to post when you want tiktok was a app where not only me but a lot of people come to get away from it all by watching edits and listening to songs they saved if this continues tiktok will be a thing in the past and someone will make a app that's better so fix it tiktok
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Gets annoying after you search for something and literally after scrolling passed a few videos all the other videos are stuff completely unrelated to what you searched for. You'd probably get like at least 7 videos that was related to your search and the rest is stuff completely unrelated to what you searched for. Please fix this it's really annoying
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Current issue with the app is the inability to swipe the images since the app immediately puts the images in a video mode. So unable to swipe images for let's say a swipe post. Like before and after type of post. Has to be fixed. It's been like this since last update. 🤦
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app actually, but lately I've been facing some problems such as, whenever I'm editing my bio or try to edit my bio, it says tiktok isn't responding or tiktok has stopped which is really really annoying cuz i can't edit my bio, and secondly whenever i send a message to someone it goes to them aster a while which is also annoying, please fix these things if you want me to give you a five star."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"so buggy, sometimes videos will freeze but I can still hear the audio. I lost the ability to use effects for like a year. lives are invasive even when I click not interested every single time. also stealing all of ur data. still one of my most used apps though 😔"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"LOVE this app 💖 although don't recommend for littles... but other than the inappropriate content it's amazing 😍 you can try out filters and upload videos I ALSO love that you can post to only yourself or just friends and not everyone in the world! I do think that it's unfair that you have to have 1,000 followers to go live and to have 100 followers to do the slide show thing. But this app is really just great you can share videos on it too! Definitely recommend tiktok! Thank you for making it!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After the update, there are so many random bugs. On my android phone, sending a video to someone else and them actually receiving it is 50/50. Sometimes, I get the notification for the video, but no video in the inbox."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Honestly I don't know if it's a blessing in disguise or not that tiktok has just completely stopped working I can't login and it wants 6! Verifications before anything says my account doesn't exist I reset password then try to login it says ""network error"" I turn off wifi go to full bars 5g, continuous loading that leads to nothing... submit two reports.. ghosted.. try logging in on laptop doesn't work... try looking up ways to fix problem, find many other people with same problem.. a year ago.."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why is the search bar completely useless. You used to be able to put in a few into it and tiktok would only show you videos tagged as those keywords. Now its just another fyp, i have to shift through completely irrelevant content to get something remotely relevant to what i was looking for. Also keep getting eating disorder videos under my search results that dont contain inputted keywords. Does this app wanna piss off mummy bloggers again"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"good, but why is this app literally the ONLY app that gets so laggy and slow but everything else works fine. It keeps saying ""no internet"" but i don't know if it's only for me but it just sometimes works really slow and i go onto another app and it works fine? Also these sudden and random useless updates are literally ruining the app 😢, it's so random and unasked for. Plz stop adding random updates nobody asked for."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app was good before the recent updates, now its very buggy when i try to search for anything, the page will slide to the left before glitching out, shrinking in on the screen, and finally pulling me up to the search page. This happens when i want to pull up anything that isnt on my fyp"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Cool app, easy way to upload videos and gain a popular audience. BUT, tiktok keeps ruining the quality on videos, and it's getting real annoying tbh. The new update also doesn't show the option to make it high quality for some reason."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I love this app but recently have problems opening it. I,m downloading it the third time this month now just so I'll be able to open it for like a week or smth and having to delete and re-download it again when I click on the app icon nothing happens. There not even a black screen or anything, just , just nothing please fix this because at some point I won't have the nerves to repeat this anymore 1,983 people found this helpful was this review helpful please tiktokteam help my account asif Khan"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,TikTok is so buggy. I cannot use commercial sounds (popular audios) or sometimes when I'm trying to make a video and use one my favorite sounds but all of them just sort of disappears out of nowhere? No clue why but it's getting annoying. Otherwise everythings ok.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Its a ok app, been going down hill. Lots of movie accounts that show a billion clips to show a entire movie. Block them but thats all you can do. Lots of scam accounts that use the same name. Lots of ads that are really bad. I hardly see the content or content creators that made this app so good anymore because of the algorithm. I wouldnt be surprised if everyone heads out from here if something better comes along."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm not sure what happened in the last update, but my fyp is all out of wack, it's full of videos I would never voluntarily watch and genuinely dislike it. I've praised tiktok for its intuitive algorithm, better than YouTube, better than Spotify, it's the first app that actually understood my taste and now it's just awful. I hope whatever they did with the last update was temporary, because I cannot watch this new slew of nonsense."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I wanted to look through someone's reposts but when I check it didn't show the repost icon 😭😭 Everytime I uninstall and reinstall it'll show up but when I reopen the app it just stops showing it.. I'm on my 6th reinstall rn. Tiktok would usually take away features I would usually have for some odd reason and it's hella dumb
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Never had any bad experiences untill recently, i can't see my saved sounds anymore, videos quality get worse and worse over time, it takes forever to load even tho i have a good Internet, fix quality and sound issues. Edit : sound stuff is fixed now but i keep getting the warning for my videos that their unorigional and uneligible for the fyp, when i make them myself, and are not low quality! Fix this team tiktok!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Fantastic if I can get it to work. After the update, however, my feed has been incredibly glitchy or it isn't even loading at all. I go to my saved videos and nothing loads. I even try to message my friends and it doesn't go through."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Tiktok did remove lots of sounds for copyright reasons but I don't know what's happening but I have not been able to use any of the filters. The app has also been glitching every time. I have had this app for 3+ years and have never had problems until now.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Suddenly the editing options have changed. Trying to upload a video either of a 5 min video, or a few assorted sized ones to then split and edit.. but it only allows me to change the speed of my upload or to crop the video. Where has everything else gone?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This was great until I was logged out of my account for no reason, I keep trying to log back in but it keeps saying ""no internet connection"" even though my Wi-Fi is completely fine. I've checked multiple times and both my password and username are correct. The account had almost 2k followers and I can't recover it, it wasn't a ban either, I was logged out for no reason. No other people have access to my account, I'm thinking about just deleting this app and never coming back to it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"THIS IS THE WORST APP EVER! If i can rate it zero stars I WILL! It's glitching when im doing a video, i cant use the beautify filters in peace BECAUSE ITS NOT WORKING and when I exit the app i can still hear the videos LOUDLY in the backround, its not letting me scroll to see the other videos and when i post a private video it makes it public, i cant follow anymore because its not letting me and ITS GETTING ON MY NERVES I have a lot more to share but im running out of characters."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok previously had closed captions as an option, but they've completely disappeared for me (no longer present in the menu and no longer present in videos). I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app several times to no change."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Since the recent update, the app has had connectivity issues. I used to have no issues loading videos, but now I have to be on an internet connection with speeds of 100Mbps just to get no issues. Any lower and I have issues which is insane."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It take forever for a video to be uploaded. Uploading a video takeS over 2 hours have been trying to upload a video after waiting for so long when it gets to 96% it remains there. The most annoying thing about the app is when uploading a video you can't leave the app or your upload will cancel and all over again 😡😡
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,As much I am obsessed with this app. The past two or three month about half of my for you page is trying to sell me stuff in the tiktok shop. You need to slow down. It's getting really annoying with all of those sales pitches. I don't care who's in it.. I do not wish to see a commercial of ANY KIND every other video. Thank you
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It is nice to learn new dying, cooking, and funny videos. I wish there was an option to bleep out bad language. Also, away to choose what you see and that it was respectful of things that are offensive. Instead of in your face and keeps repeating."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's OK some vids are fun others informative others HATEFULL. The problem that irks me is if I interact in any shape or form ( comment, like ) then I'm inundated with all their content! I thought that was what the follow button was for! I want to have some control over what content that is selected for me. Thanx!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hi TikTok I am a new user The best feature I like most in TikTok is use this any template and I can easily edit video with just 1 click and it's a great way to spend my free time.It includes all kinds of good content including art videos, template, videography, photography, etc where I can get all the benefits of the facility of uploading videos and tutorials.Thank you :)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've been on this app since 2021 I must say it doesn't get worse nor boring but there are some inappropriate videos but I really enjoy this app but it has problems with ""Copyrighted"" sounds/music. I know UMG has a problem but I hope the sounds/music comes back may not sooner but later"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is good I love it but there is some inappropriate content on the app but it rarely pops up. But there is such a nerve wrecking problem for me (maybe for other Huawei P30 users) I can't open tiktok at all no clue why. I refresh my phone tiktok it doesn't work, open it from the app store still doesn't work. It only shows the tiktok icon then immediately discards it! I really hope tiktok will fix this problem thank you."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I normally love this app. I use it more than Google for searching things. Have learned alot about other cultures, been more up to date about news, and love sharing important and funny videos with my friends and family. The issue I have run into now is I can no longer receive any msg. I have to Uninstall the application and then install it again to see anything anyone sent me and when doing that it messes up my FYP. I have reported a problem and continuously get the same response from the team."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is not so bad when you know who to follow and who not to, you'll get a really cool fyp. But the commenting your reposts and liking other people's reposts feature being gone has got on my nerves, it was basically the best feature of the app and it's gone now. I really want it to come back because it makes all the app more fun to interact with, without it it's pretty dry."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"1 out of 5 videos is an advertisement. A further 1 out of 5 videos is a paid partnership. LIVE streams make up another 1 out of every 5 videos of which the vast majority are coercing you into giving gifts - which you pay for. This leaves about 40% creator content, of this 40%, a quarter are worth watching. That's about 1 in 10 videos. Tiktok has become an ultra commercialized wasteland. I've been using this app for over 3 years now, and it's disappointing to see what it's become."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app is entertaining but why are you ruining the quality of my videos whenever I upload them? My phone records high quality videos which remain high quality on Instagram and Facebook but the moment I upload them on Tiktok they became so bad. Can you please fix this issue. I like posting my videos in your app to save my memories but this problem of bad upload quality is annoying.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The overall app is great. It let's you interact with other people, make videos on sounds, great app. But the camera quality in android sucks. I have tried all the ways I could to increase the quality but nothing helps!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like this app. I've had it for a few years and it's a great way of seeing and posting relatable content and connecting with like-minded people. It's a fun app and a fun community, but what is going on with the muting of multiple tiktoks on many accounts, including both of mine?? I know other people have experienced this too over the past couple of days and that it's not just me. It really sucks, especially for people who spend so much time making edits, like me. Do better and sort it out!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"After the recent update I cant see live previews at the top of the screen in my inbox, or following page. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app. I've cleared the cache and downloads. Restarted my phone. Nothing worked."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good app! But sometimes every few months it just crashes and doesn't allow me to open the app. This is, if I were to guess, the fourth or fifth time I'm forced to re-download it because of that. And I'm not even the only person with this problem- Please fix this!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app is getting one star until notifications are reverted back to when your have multiple tiktok notifications the app opens to messages and can select each notification from there. I hate that I have to hit multiple drop downs just to get into my multiple notifications. Fix ASAP.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's good when you have a updated version of phone and from what I've learned in a 30 trial on my other account on the android phone is not 100 % Don't have less then 10% of batteries power it can and did cost me a complete lost of sit & go and also spins.... your phone without noticing it will either over heat or freeze your current system for up to a 15mins
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Update is adding stickers, yet no one is getting views. I, for one, am ready to leave this app. I'm so unmotivated to make videos when they get 200 views. It's sad tik tok is nothing but ads. You all even added a message to my inbox that I cannot delete from sellers. Really??"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Multiple filters are not available in my region even though they are and I can't access the TikTok shop.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Usually happy with it but have lost auto-generated captions on videos. I would rely on it to watch. I deleted and reinstalled the app and still missing. I asked for a support in the app and there hasn't been a reply as yet.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It lags everytime I put a filter on until the whole app just stops working and kicks me out. Now if I do one take delete it and try to redo it, it won't let me record until I exit out of the vid and reselect the sound. I use to get alot more reach before then I did now too. Honestly this app is just starting to get really annoying."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like the app, but the ""not interested"" feature does nothing. I say ""not interested in any live videos"" every time one pops up, and it's pretty often. The same goes for certain content creators, if you don't wanna see it then you have to block them and all the fan accounts posting their videos."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I just tried to download it and after it was done downloading I went to go open it and it won't open I tap on the app on my home screen and nothing happens so I'm going to uninstall and never reinstall it unless the people that made it can fix that issue and they won't because they are more worried about more people trying to sue them than they are fixing there problem
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This kicked me out multiple times. It is to addicting. If you want to stay on a place permanently don't go on this app. If you get kicked out you get an option that says username and password but if you forget it it doesn't even let you clicked the button called ' log in with no password'
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"2.13.24 Y'all seriously made it worse! We don't need these blinding transitions just to go into notifications. Just stop! 12.23.23 What in the world did y'all do with this most recent update? The crazy, unnecessary extra movements/ transitions are annoying! I promise there's plenty of visual stuff going on! I wish I could undo the update!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's an amazing and fun app, but recently the app has been extremely slow. It's near impossible to look at comments, search things, and message people because of how laggy and slow it is. I wouldn't recommend downloading until they fix this."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Addicting, however, my chief complaint is when someone sends a vid to me, it asks me if I want to open in the app. My choices are Continue & Go Back, so I click Continue thinking it's going to take me to my app on my phone, but NO, it doesn't! It sends me to the Play Store to download an app I already have and am logged into! It's ANNOYING! Needs a way to detect ""Hey, this device already has the app! Go there now!"" I'm begging u, PLEASE fix this bug! It's driving But for that it'd be 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Glitches, I can't record a video without it appearing gray. It's not my phone camera.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Pretty upset that android still doesn't have a darkmode(snap even gave us dark mode), I have a glitch with the storage where I can't see how much storage it's taking up in the app, the adds are getting worse, doesn't load most times not even because of my connection either, clicks on lives everytime I try to swipe past them"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very upset. Went live for the first time yesterday (tried several times) and my audience can't hear me at all. I checked my permission on my microphone/made sure I was not on mute and nothing has worked. I have made SEVERAL support tickets. I have tried deleting the app and redownloading, nothing is working. Biggest disappointment is this is my first time going live because I've been so nervous just to be completely embarrassed and Tiktok never helps."

Since this year, there's been many glitches and So many fake accounts, scammers, and hackers on the app. I get plenty of them Everyday. I may drop my review down to a 4 star soon.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It won't play the videos that have been sent to me. I click the link and it opens a video but it's never the one that was sent. I spend HOURS clicking and refreshing and trying again and again. It's the only reason I got the damn app to begin with.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It been several days until tik Tok completely freezes on me, whenever I try to post a video it freezes, then it crash couldn't upload video, I have to keep going to app settings force stop. I unistalled reinstalled again and it does the same thing. If you don't fix this I'm unistalling this app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is so laggy I've been a content creator for 4 years having problems with the app and not being able to get paid at all for my content. There isn't any reason to contact tiktok cus they don't do anything, not even respond to your messages or complaints. I've been informing them of there issues in hopes it'll be resolved but like I mentioned before nothing has been done. They do not care"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app is bad I have downloaded a couple of videos right. I create amv and it takes time creating an video I could never upload certain vids without getting muted I only have this problem on TikTok and not on insta like what the even if I give credit on TikTok it doesn't work now I have to delete the videos like what's the point it's an amv music is supposed to be played but it's muted I'm really starting to hate it man it's trash 🗑️
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I don't know what's happening to TikTok?? So first, Tiktok took away my photo and video button and I couldn't upload photos. I deleted it and installed it again and I had it but I didn't have my repost button and all of my reposts were gone. Then my drafts got deleted?? I went to storage and cleared up space and downloads and I got my repost buttom back but my photo and video option disappeared. Plus I had troubles uploading videos because tiktok would lag. And no it's not my phone its new!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's so annoying when I'm watching something on tik tok and message Pops up and asking for to on your location and give no choice to skip it. We should have the choice to choose whether we want that option or not.!!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The best feature in TikTok that I like the most is :USE this/ any template; & I can edit videos easily with just 1 click & a best way to fast my free time. It contains all types of good content including funny videos, templets videography, photography etc. where I can get all the benefits for the facility of uploading the video & tutorials by different people. (THANK YOU ;)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app often crashes and becomes slow after using it for a while despite my phone being overall fast. There are too much ads every 2 or 3 videos. Although it's quite a good app, not really recommended since it's very addictive."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is great, but the problem is that some options like photo upload on comment is not available unless if you update it or you will have to wait for the next update.The other option also I cant do is create a part,for example if I do a part:1,2,3 and I wanted to add to a one collection but I can't because I don't have that option.You may wonder why I can't?,Because I'm in Europe and for some American options receive it fast,Meanwhile for Europe you have to wait a long time."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Annoyed that the all will automatically open despite disabling notifications. This only happens if I have the app open and I don't fully close the app. It is inconvenient and makes me not want to keep it installed anymore.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have two mobile numbers. Both are Android, one is Samsung, and the other is Techno Sparks 5, when I use Samsung mobile and search for songs or music in it, it shows the same list as in other Android phones. It happens and the search item is shown, but when I use techno sparks mobile and try to put a song or music in the background of a photo or video, the search item is the result. The show doesn't happen and instead of it another kind of song or music show, please solve this problem as soo"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Up untill the last update this app was working fine on my phone. Now it tells me that this application may stop working at times due to your device.. surely they should be able to run this app for all devices not just the newer up to date phones. It literally loads and kicks me straight off
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy using tictok, just dislike the users that's on here trying to catfish people out of their money. It's ridiculous. Wish there was a way to get rid of these scams. Other than that I always recommend to my friends to use this platform to communicate with others. I've stopped using the app before but I always return to it. It's a great app to be on, I just overlook the people that's using it the wrong way."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok ain't working and keeps showing no internet connection. I have a fine connection, all the other apps are working well but tiktok and capcut are not working and keep showing no internet connection. Pls fix this problem. Is there any connection between these two?? Please look out as soon as possible it's so annoying!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"App has some pretty cool videos. The major downfall that I've found that nobody has highlighted that it seems like every time someone follows w/ a follow back within 10 minutes the conversation (which seems to be the exact same script) turns into ""are you single or married, what are you here for, send money, gas card, or can you download another chat app so we can talk better)."" When did tiktok become a prostitution app? I'm ready to uninstall the app. Easier than reporting everyone"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Too many self-made reels are being unposted because of content being too explicit for a sad, sad world. All anyone has to do if they don't enjoy and / or like the reels I try to make they do have other options. Scroll on by, not look at them, period, and so forth."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The best feature in TikTok that I like the most in use this any. Timplate & I can edit videos easliy with just one click and best way to pass my free time it's contents all type of constants in clouding songs video templates TikTok voirl videos for you page etc where I can get all the benefites for the facility off uploading the videos and tutoialis by different people's Thank you✊
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Disgusting. The more it gets updated the worse it gets. Now with the whole copyright thing they removed all the good sounds leaving editors and creators completely hopeless. I yet to understand how the heck is a MUSIC app supposed to keep working when they start removing MUSIC. The updates get worse and worse as they keep removing enjoyable features like the repost comment and stuff. It used to be a 5 star but now it's loosing downloads and I enjoy it's downfall.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app. Or, it was. My account got ""temporarily"" suspended for no reason, and i had just made that account around another or so ago. I did nothing, and this morning i turned on my phone, went to tiktok and it said that my account was suspended. I thought it wasn't a big deal and that I could just bypass it, deal with it later and for now just sctoll through tiktok, but no. Now i can't watch tiktok, because when i open it a box pops up and says ""your account has been permanently banned""."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Heyy they app is great but its currently glitching alot and whats up with the offline feature my friends and family have it but me I try everything and even updating the app but its not working but right now the app is glitching and my connecton is perfectly fine I'm using other apps fine but tiktok doesn’t show up at all i think there's something wrong with the app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The recent updates suck. You can't like reposts anymore, the white background behind reposts makes it harder to see the video behind it, the video gets small when you open the comments, and there's a continuous flow of notifications you get from people liking videos that you reposted. It's constant spam, and it just fills up your inbox. I literally can't see when people have liked my videos or comments because of the overbearing spam about how ""So-and-so liked a video you reposted."" So annoying."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After the latest update, tiktok fails to open when clicking the icon. And then my entire phone becomes unusable. After clicking on tiktok and failing to open it. Can't do anything with my phone have to reboot it in order to use my phone. Nothing i can do to fix it as an end user. 🤷‍♂️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's an amazing app and I'll love it forever BUT whenever I update it tiktok suddenly refuses to open and crashes/closes itself before even loading up my fyp, the only way I can resolve this is uninstalling and re-installing every single time and lose all of my drafts/have to log in and sync everything again"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have been on this app for almost a year. I release videos about social important issues and peace on earth. No matter what I do, most of my videos only get around 250 views. This app doesn't encourage creators to continue creating content as it seems it's a waste of time. My messages are not reaching people who need to hear it neither I get any financial rewards from being on it as compared to creators from other countries."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"With the latest update, every few videos has a glitch of not playing the vid but the audio plays. Also, I like to keep my most searched topics on my search list and now they seem to reset daily making it less convenient to get to my favorite topics."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Can we get an option with a dropdown to sort through who we are following, like if someone no longer updates their channel or from when we subscribed from oldest to newest? I'd like to be able to sort through and organize without my list constantly resetting and putting me back at the top with the latest person I followed. It's frustrating trying to report spam and fake accounts or some posting sexual content, and being told no violations were made."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"IT's awesome , Its better then all other social media apps , i love its templates & also this app filters . And i can easily edit my videos . And the best thing is that i never see any bad content or hilarious content . The customer service team responce is Good . I love that app so much & advice u to use that app once . Hope u enjoy like me & like others . The most intresting & Amazing thing in this is Capcut Templates which make my video perfect . And u can easily voice over on your videos."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a very great app! The only problem I've really had is my videos aren't reaching larger audiences and my videos are just getting less and less views throughout time and I used to get thousands of views on my videos and I've been making the same content, I'm struggling just to even get more than 100 views on my videos now"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I never used Tiktok before. Today I get sent a link to watch a video. It's a Tiktok video. So, I downloaded the app. Started to go through the sign up process. Bam! I get hit with a pop-up telling me. ""We have had multiple issues and reports about your account. You are permanently banned from Tiktok."" Umm, can someone please explain to me. How someone gets banned from an app service. When that person has never used that app or service. Needless to say, I'll never use this app again."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Tiktok even if i don't use it as often like other apps but i don't see any problem with tiktok other then sometimes its laggy for me but thats about it. I haven't explored tiktok entirely so i have little experience, i started 2 or 3 months ago but since i haven't used it as much i have little experience but i do love the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Review Orders Not Working! The tiktok shop ""view all"" for recent orders is not working. Nothing happening when pushing ""view all"". Makes it more stressful when you can't track recent orders. I restarted my device, cleared the cache and everything is updated. It's on tiktok's end."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's Hard to see the WHOLE VIDEO or PIC because there's TOO much writing & info printed all across the LOWER SCREEN til I just TURN IT OFF & go to YouTube at times. Please CLEAN that up so we can see """"results"" at the bottom of the screens. I don't mind the ads as much but I HATE all the JUNK THAT BLOCKS the VIEW. I'm NOT alone in this. I have many Friends thar have deleted the ap & I have too in the past. No use watching if you can't SEE the whole pic. Thanks for opportunity to express.💙"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,this app will not let me upload my photos onto TikTok in a way that you can swipe through them. I keep trying to do it but it's not letting me. and I think this problem is only happening to me because I've seen many swipeable tiktoks and yet mine won't post that way.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Usually I have a pretty good time with tiktok, especially with searches giving me specifically what I searched for. However after the last update I'll get like three to four videos of what I searched for and then start getting videos that have nothing to do with the topic. Hell today I was watching tiktoks regarding UFC and started getting videos about Tattooing and other random clips. I mean on a FYP that makes sense but this is after a specific search. Please look into this."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's working fine which is something essential for me in order to give a high rate, and it's a very friendly app, interactive & with all that is happening in the 🌐 this app has actually managed to keep me informed, something I didn't saw it coming bc I didn't wanted more social media accounts, BUT my brother gifted me a cellphone and he downloaded the app for me a ask me to try it, I did, and I like it. & I can always filter the content I want/like to see."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I posted a video of my drive. Here is the problem. I used the song Highway to Hell and I added the artist info through tiktoks sounds. Now I've been violated because of copyright. Don't see how this is possible do to I listed the artist through the tiktok app. So I was going to build a community over here with trucking. But screw it. I remember why I deleted this app to begin with. Thanks for the reminder and go Fu#k Your Selfs!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I dont like how it refreshes and you loose the video you was watching. Then have to go clear around the app to the watch history just to find the video again. And also I miss the now post other than that it's my favorite social media app to watch videos on! Despise the viruses, the hackers, and the trolls... Its great community for a number of things."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The lag in this app is horrible!!! I would love to give it a 5 star but I just can't. IDK if there r just too many people on it or what but it is absolutely HORRIBLE!!!!! I have to go in and out of the app just to unfreeze it sometimes and it isn't my wifi because I have very good service on my other apps.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I was scrolling through tiktok happily because tiktok is the best right. But then I found a very funny and relatable video, which I wanted to repost, so like normal, im about to click the repost button yet it didn't let me. In fact, on every single video, the repost button was GONE! Thus, I am thoroughly outraged. If tiktok doesn't add this back,I will be writing more bad reviews about it. For this,I think they deserve a 1 star. You were good. But you downgraded completely. I'm disappointed.. :/"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I am using this app from a long time now and I start uploading my contant on it but I realize that there is so many features are missing for me like upload in hd quality options and switch to photos mode and autoswipe mode ,effects and many more and don't no why I'm facing my other problems in the app ...... I hope that u fix my problem 😔"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Far too many ads! TikTok is very handy. Lots of nascent business opportunities, professionals offering good advice. An opportunity for some to vent live - almost like therapy (and receive support). There's garbage as well, but the law of large numbers. There's more positive than negative. If it's discovered the Chinese are collecting, using data harmfully, it'll disappear. Until then, fascinating and highly recommended! DON'T SPEND HOURS ON TIKTOK."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I denied permission to view my contacts but TikTok is still notifying me when individual people in my phone contacts have posted videos. It's is using their actual names. If they can't see my contacts, how are they telling me that ""John Smith from your phone contacts just posted a video."" Functionally zero moderation. A sesspool of illegal activity."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Its been going on for few months now everytime someone texts me tiktok opens up by itself not even on message like it doesnt matter what i do on any other app am texting or something. When someone sends me video or texts on tiktok it opens itself. Also today having some issues with opening up dms or anything other screen has like slide way and gkes black for a second like switching to other app and then opens it up
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I upgraded my phone to the Samsung s24 Ultra and can no longer get notifications from TikTok. I've tried everything by checking my settings on both the phone and the TikTok app. Also, by deleting and reinstalling the app. Please help! Thanks!"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"New update makes the app feel very unwieldy, scrolling through messages now locks up when scrolling past the first 2 messages. The new additions to posts feel clunky. I put off downloading the new update but unfortunately I ended up with it installed. Worse than previous version."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"1. A few days ago I could upload slideshows perfectly fine but now the ""photos"" option doesn't even show up 2. Everytime I try reposting something and liking it at the same time it never shows that I repost it and I lose it every time"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Definitely one of the best social media apps in existence 😀 I know it's not that popular and most videos are just memes, but you can find such stuff as random facts, how to use something, the history of that meme etc. I actually would like to try out the Live, but I can't without having 1000 followers 😭 Also what I don't like is that you can get TOO many friends without even realising it. What should there be is the ""Friend request"" option. For some reason I don't get many followers🔎ipapopa."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I can't believe you're moving all the music like this is what made her up if it's for copy right purposes but still you still remember that music and now most of our edits are going to be playing and now it's going to be so plain and it's good on our videos are just going to look stupid and it's just going to be no sound at all okay so yeah all of the background noises so wow how do you like it how do you like how people are getting mad at you .
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app can be fun, but it seems they update things and when they do features just disappear. Most days I post jokes with effects, but today, the effects were just gone. I mostly enjoy the app, but the random removal of stuff without notice is obnoxious."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"If you have a Google phone, For example A Google pixel 6a, and when you try to post a photo swipe, we dont have an option for the photo swipe and theres many things i wanna post but i would need the photo swipe. overall, its a good app. It just needs another update for google users so we can have the same options as other users on this app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Besides what happened with Universal Music, with the latest update, the title I choose to show, doesn't show at the end of the upload, besides that everything is good, please fix these 2 things, it's irritating."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is basically non functional. It doesn't allow me to actually follow content that I like, leaving me at the whim of the For You page to provide content I'm not interest in. Help content doesn't work, and there's no request additional help functionality. I'm sure this isn't everyone's experience, but my experience is terrible."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"TikTok is changing and it's not necessarily for the better. They tell creators that their videos aren't good enough, and as a result they stifle your views. Also, the hashtags don't show you what's popular anymore, (no video count numbers) when you're typing in the videos' description. Also, I never know if a video's gotten a comment unless I check them all manually. It's getting depressing over there."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Horrible experience, the animation for when you click on and out of stuff gives me a feeling of vertigo and can definitely trigger some people if they have medical issues that are related with that. Remove please as its affecting how smooth the app runs and its quite the disturbance. @wg0ww"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I literally only downloaded this app to watch videos friends send me. But now when I try to open the links my friends send, it opens the app but not the video they sent. I'll be deleting this and going back to the browser version I guess."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"As much as I love the app, The UGM update, along with trying to copy the link and getting their description when I only want the link is kinda making the app unusable. Even when posting songs that aren't owned by UGM it still removes the sound. Honestly disappointed in how they ""spread your content"" too. If you don't have over 10k followers, it's like your content doesn't get pushed out and only gets 0-100 views per video. I wouldn't recommend this app to use and spread your content. 2/10."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I got this a few months back, and it's a great app! I don't have much complaints, though it gets really glitchy time to time. Sometimes, when I try to post something it just goes to 99% and stops there and delet.."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app honestly blows my mind. Never have I been able to learn more about literally anything, but so much more about myself and people that share the same connections. To the point that I've been able to self diagnose things that I've struggled with my whole life, and actually make total changes with those struggles. This app makes me laugh like I never have, and cry with the people that this app is the only one showing the raw real perspective that is otherwise hidden from us."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Highly entertaining & addictive, I've noticed something suspicious lately though 🧐. I will be in another app, and tiktok will randomly take over my screen. It happens in the blink of an eye, but you don't notice it if you're always on tiktok."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app! However, there's an issue that turned the 5 into a 4. Everyone right now is uploading simple pictures NOT video responses in the comments. I've watched many tutorials and asked many questions,yet I'm still unable to upload pictures. Please fix this."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Lately videos have been freezing on one frame while the audio still plays normally and this can happen at anytime on any video making that video unwatchable while the other videos can still play normally unless the bug feels like occurring again and it doesn't happen occasionally but a lot.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"TikTok decided to delete millions of sounds from the platform all because they don't want to pay/sign the copyright forms. And they plan on deleting all sounds, making people create their own. Its so fowl and stressful to death with. I have tons of videos that were muted to where I had to find a replacement. Not to mention that its very toxic and doesn't deal with the toxic people and the hateful people on their platform. They even say that they want to be a ""friendly"" and ""safe"" platform."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm trying to use my own sounds I have for my eyes only for regular posts for the ""photo swipe feature"" but the app has been saying sound is not available to use even though the sound is playing and it allows me to favorite my older private video sounds so I can't make my own sounds anymore. Is this a new update ???"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I can't comment anymore and it's not due to banning or suspension. Anytime I try to comment, it glitches and will not post more than 2 words of the comment, if it posts at all. If I hit the backspace key to edit a word it immediately breaks it. Googling the issue ONLY brings up clearing cache if comments from OTHER PEOPLE aren't showing up but nothing about why it won't work anymore when I try to. I attempted to update it, I even tried clearing the cache but nothing. Uninstalled. I am free"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Tiktok it's a great app to use but since it's so laggy and sometimes I lose my edits and can't publish them. Now tiktok mutes my sounds for my edits and I get it it's ok to mute my sounds for my videos but since umg is here it's getting really annoying but I am dealing with it. Also tiktok the are inappropriate stuff like there are some girls with nothing on and it just shows which really botherd me bc I was watching and some girls was with nothing on also ppl are posting about p*rn and u know..
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have been using TikTok for a while now, and I have been having a frustrating experience for some reason. Every time I post my video it gets stuck at 0 views, and it's very annoying. I guess it's not sending it to the fyp 😕"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've been using TT for years and never had a problem. You can access everything on there and socialise and follow friends. It's overall amazing but SOMETIMES the adds can be a little annoying but U can just scroll past them no probs but one thing is is that you NEED internet or mobile data to use this app. If your young and reading this PLEASE put your account on private and to the parents put your child's account on private because there can be a lot of predators on here. Overall great!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The only reason I'm using the app is to watch the links my girlfriend sends me. If the browser site was actually usable I would be happily using that instead but they make it purposely inconvenient to use in order to draw you into the app itself. It's greedy, soulless, just plain unethical. This is just one of the many flaws both in design and business ethics that they take part in. They don't deserve the constant praise they get just because they are the only real option for short videos."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Good app. and addictive. But the only issue is that the slideshow keeps being on video mode. even though I want it to be manually swiping to see the photos. I think it's called photo mode.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Can't rate for anything other than the phone. My issues are with laptop/Chromebook -- it should work on any laptop BUT frustratingly I cannot complain, cannot do anything other than phone. Now going to phone to see if it took & if my OLD ACCOUNT is still in its memory. I cannot log-in online because TikTok online won't let me & keeps repeating the log-in sequences without logging me in."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,A lot of my videos have lost their audio because of the umg negotiations. I have put a lot of work into my videos and to have them muted causes a lot of distress. Many of my friends on tiktok are also affected heavily by it. Fix this.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The comments have been effing irritating! I either can't post a comment or when I do half the sentence is gone and it spam posts it. I deleted the app, redownloaded it with no change of the bug. Sometimes I have to add the video to my favorites then access my favourites in order to post a comment at all."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I cannot use the ""Report a Problem"" feature anymore, and there is still no Dark Mode for Android users. I wish images and videos saved didn't all go to the same folder the photos and videos taken by my camera go to."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I hate tiktoks new updates. It removed the comment repost, pin comment, captions, retouch filter, and it just took away every beauty filter. I literally do not have any filter that is beauty related. Only games, greenscreen, etc. Now I'm just insecure in my tiktoks because there is absolutely no filters. Fix it please."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The number of ads and commission videos for TikTok shop is deplorable. Every what, 2 videos is someone trying to sell something. It's not uncommon to get 3 ads/commission videos in a row. It's like there's next to no actual content anymore. It's sickening."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is very good, but I have some issues. Whenever I update the app, I will get a feature I've never had 6 when I update it again, it's gone. My ability to repost videos will change every time I update, and I can't view friends' reposts."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"after years of using the app just fine pretty sure ive only broken 1 rule and that was an accident, i go without a phone for almost a month only to log back in and see tha my account is set to be deleted for being underaged 4 das after my 18th birthday, and tiktok makes it impossible to do anything because when i try to appeal i get stuck on the submit screen, and the contact information listed underneath the app is outdated as well so just have to lose everything i guess.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ever since they updated the app, the algorithm of my lives are terrible! I used to go live everyday and have over 1k, now I mabey get 300. It's also not just me, it's a ton of people, apparently because they are pushing tik tok shop. They are going to lose a ton of people because of this. They need to stop updating the app. And give people a chance for good views on lives to make money and have fun!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They're working very hard to suppress people's content. They're working even harder to manipulate people into buying their promote package by preventing people's videos from being seen. The promote package they want you to buy has extremely low value. I've posted quite a few videos, and you can tell when they take it off the ""for you"" page because my videos get good engagement for a few minutes, then nothing. On top of that, the regularly shadow ban people for apparently nothing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this app, good to pass the time. Lots of dumb videos but also videos that are informative & funny, sweet, & pretty much anything could want to see. Videos are all under a minute and perfect for when you're waiting for the doctor ."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"this is TIK TOK. literally an app based around music, discovering new artists and songs, and putting music over LITERALLY. EVERYTHING. and therefore you mute an ungodly amount of content on the app?? god forbid tik toks have music i guess, i am PRAYING on your downfall, this app is a parasite"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's a fun app as long as the fyp is working and you ain't seeing the same videos over and over again. The fast-forward function ain't working as well makes it quite annoying.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"hello, please get rid of your new rule on tiktok I can no longer post edits without it being taken down for being ""unoriginal"" and essentially stolen. I've tried to repost it many times and I get the same message, even after it's appealed it won't reach the fyp cause its far too late for that. I understand what your trying to do but this isn't helping editors in any way possible."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app was much better before they decided that every time my contacts publicly shared a video that it should register as a private message. All that did was ensure that I will NEVER see actual private messages. What a silly, boneheaded change!"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's not the best because I used to have the ""slideshow"" feature and now I don't and there's some inappropriate pictures on certain people's thumbnails (which I'm not gonna say the name of em) and people really don't want to see that stuff and I needs taken down cause people think it's not fair if their videos get taken down and the people's don't."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Normally spend a lot of time on this app. Has been glitchy the last few days. Today it wouldn't load and required me to update.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It's a good app for having a laugh but i noticed my phone started glitching and it asked did i was to sync my phone numbers i pressed no but a couple of weeks later I got a notification saying this person you might know from you contacts . I wouldn't advise the app if it gets into your phone and just does what it wants why even ask for permission
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's very annoying that i follow about 600 people, and yet tiktok shows me not even 1% of all the people i follow. And on top of that, I can't even go a full hour without it starting to repeat the same videos i just watched, and when i try to refresh to get new ones, they show me the exact same videos AGAIN!!!! Tiktok needs to fix this, I should be able to scroll for hours with how many people I follow"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Glitching like crazy. My FYP keeps reloading things I have already seen and I keep getting pushed content that I'm not interested in. Lives and loading videos are extremely choppy, but my internet is not the problem. The new repost feature sucks as well."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Videos I've already liked are reappearing, Videos I've seen are repeating, I like a post and suddenly it's back to back of the same user, Videos I've labeled as not interested continue to appear. Something is off with the app. Was never like this."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Atrocious performance! App freezes phone, lags videos, trying to upload a video and choosing a cover is nearly impossible. How can anyone give it more than 1 star when it barely works"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,App works normally but I've noticed a bug in it where I don't have the option to upload photo slides. It just turns into a transition video with my photos. Please fix this bug!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Appeal system is worthless, they don't actually tell you specifically why your appeal has failed just the same old "" violates our guidelines"" yes which one? Also why have an email to contact them and when you do send an email it doesn't go through, a link is provided sending you to their 'ticket system' which then doesn't have an easy layout on getting to the right department, appears to be they're only concerned with protecting big creators or some agenda"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Been a user for 4 years. It's a shame that the updates don't improve the app. First they deleted the option to pin comments, then they changed the fonts, and the repost button. No one had a problem with those things, why change it? The most annoying thing though, is the report system. Tiktok takes down videos and comments that don't deserve it, yet they can't find violations in the videos I report, which clearly go against the violations. Please fix this, to keep your app and its users safe."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I would rate higher but when I edit my vids with text and choose a color no color pops up it depends on what color and it'll turn white or black and I really liked using colors and other people that I've seen on they're vids has the colors.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Can't even open app, it clicks open and immediately exits again. Have had this issue since 3 updates ago so clearly no improvements. Very disappointed after the great things I've heard about this app 😑😱 still happening, very frustrating 😡"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Definitely needs an option to remove all unavailable videos from saved files. Removing one at a time and waiting for the refresh before the next is too long especially with many videos.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have two phones. When I bought my new phone I transferred the number and kept the old phone. Why? Search filter doesn't exist on my new phone(known issue with Google phones that I didn't know before). It does on my old phone(LG phone). Well the recent update 🪛 up my app. Saying my account was banned but wasn't. I can't use the app on my old phone now and trying to find help is clear as mud. The filters are the reason I installed the app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I like the app itself however logging in is the worst of all apps I have, it's absolutely a nightmare to try and stay a influencer on this app it's next to impossible to login, they make you login with images and when you match them they too many attempts this isn't influencer friendly"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This latest update messed up the videos. Half of them are scrunched to one side and you can't see part of it. The other ones don't show any options on the screen sometimes.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Everything is fine except for the photo mode. It's so annoying that the option disappears all the time and i can't upload my drafts that i made when the option was available. Tiktok please fix this

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I would give it a better rating but the app can be a little difficult to navigate or work at times. Personally my biggest issue is that I can not edit captions or tags on posts I make and this is a big issue for me because my phone is slow and sensitive so there's times I spend time making or editing a video and when I go to put my caption and tags in sometimes it will just skip the caption part and just post the video and then I have to delete it because I can't edit and restart
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Okay, so personally I love tiktok. However the app has had some problems recently. Not only does the app sometimes just don't load, but also sometimes the app just doesn't open. Restating the app or my phone doesn't solve the problem, so I always need to uninstall and then install the app again, which is really annoying as my drafts get deleted each time."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"TikTok used to be so good and fun to use but now since TikTok has taken away the slideshow feature for most of us and the app has gotten more bugs now, it gotten annoying, also not to mention they have taken away some of the most famous audios because they just refuse to pay universal music studio, TikTok please fix your app"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is becoming Useless,it is muting my recent videos, what is a video without a sound?a video becomes useless without it's sound so I'm thinking of getting rid of tiktok and get my lost space back."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I love the app! I'm looking forward to creating more on there! I don't like that the app can get slow when editing or posting a video. For instance today I picked out the cover of my video and it totally didn't set. Now my video has a weird cover. It's happened to me multiple times. I think there should be an edit feature for that specific default. Even for editing the caption! There could be a lot of great fixes! Please listen to your users! 🤘🫶
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I got this a few months back, and it's a great app! I don't have much complaints, though it gets really glitchy time to time. Sometimes, when I try to post something it just goes to 99% and stops there and deletes the entire video I just worked so hard on, and now I have to start from scratch. I haven't pressed anything whatsoever, however I just find it really troublesome having to stress over posting videos PRAYING it won't delete. 1 person found this helpful"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, it's a good app. And I don't struggle too much posting edits or content. The only issue is though is that, recently, I've been struggling to even get in the app! Everytime I try and open it, it crashes! Sometimes it will tell me ""Tiktok is working due to misconfigureations, please press this to fix them"" and then it crashes again!! I have to uninstall and reinstall just to have 1 session of watching it! Really, really annoying"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have loved this app ever since I downloaded it back in 2019, and I have probably used it far too much. But the most recent update that makes a ""pinwheel/spinning"" motion effect when you touch something like messages or settings makes the app so hard to keep going on. The transition takes way too long and gives me a headache. The app was a lot better without that effect. There should at least be a way to remove the effect or change it via the settings for people or are motion sick easily."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Lately, as in last couple of months, the app has gotten ""stuck"" on videos I watched previously that are unrelated to the video playing. It's getting worse as time goes on."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app, I love all the relatable, funny, and useful content on here, but sometimes there are problems that occur that are really not supposed too. I don't know if anyone else has been having the same problem as me, but my recently every time I like a video from my fyp, it doesn't appear on my profile in the liked videos section. I tried refreshing multiple times, I don't have to update the app because it doesn't need to, and I have cleared out any other tabs that may be open on my phone."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is great, I love being able to save TikTok's and watch them offline or send to a friend. But here's my problem, I heard of Message DM on TT but I have no way at all of using it! Plus I can't do the slideshow as in sliding the images, but my friends can do these things and I can't, I'm frustrated with it and don't understand one fricken bit why I can't use these features..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok is an amazing app but the reason for 4 stars is that it has one problem that has developed after the update. It kicks me out and lags even on full bars WiFi and it's just slow in general, filters and songs take so long to load. When I get kicked out I have to delete and reinstall and it's honestly annoying af so if possible pls fix that. But other than that everythings excellent. Thank You"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"We like the concept and using this app. Just the glitches along with finding that for our Galaxy S9 it has lesser features than our Galaxy S7 did. Effects are much lesser, which could do with a search option along with many other features, such as when editing a video sharing we have to search through all of the editing effects only to find they move around based off of how much we use them until a new one comes in and shakes it all up, we need a search option along with an *Add to favourites*"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"i have used this app regularly for over a year. i really enjoyed until the most recent update. now, between tabs, it does this awful ppt transition on the screen. like it spins the entire screen a couple times and then goes back to where you wanted to go. it's not only deeply annoying because the transition is too long and too overt, it causes a headache. i like tiktok and the info i get from the creators i follow, but this update is the most bizarre and unnecessary app change ive ever seen."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have had tiktok since it was released and ever since then I had no problems with the app. But now, as a content creator the filming is horrible. The sound is all messy, my videos are delayed sometimes and when I try to duet, it messes up completely. I've cleaned out storage and do anything I can think of but still no change when i film my videos. Edit (12/2/23): Tiktok has yet updated again. I wish it'll stop giving things just to take them away."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The for you page isn't for you anymore, every third video is an ad and it repeatedly shows posts I've deliberately clicked ""not interested"" on. At least vine went out with a bang"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,TikTok removed the add comments to repost. That was one of the best features in my opinion & taken all of the music that we actually like away. I had A few sounds saved as favorite & now they're completely gone.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's more than a month now that I can't open the app. Reinstalling does not work. I see there are more reviews about this problem but nothing is being done about it? Second time the app does this, a few months ago it was the same problem but it eventually worked again... now it's taking so long."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I like the app. But hate that if you wantto buy anything from the shop, it's like a £4 shipping fee for each item, which is more than the cost of the product."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm deeply disappointed with the moderation policy on TikTok. My experience has been frustrating, as I've received strikes for what I believe are harmless phrases. On the other hand, my complaints about others using STRONG OFFENSIVE language are completely ignored. This inconsistent and seemingly arbitrary approach to moderation makes the platform less enjoyable and fair. It feels like there's a lack of transparency and fairness in how policies are applied."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Audio just sometimes doesn't load with a video after the latest update. Taping on the audio and playing it then works but then the video doesn't load.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I personally just went on the app store after having this app for a long time to actually rate it. Why is it 5 stars? They constantly do updates and listen to us as viewers. They added a function where you can add the music you hear from the tiktoks. No more searching the song or asking in the comments. Love this app
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,great but I'm having problems with the updates and they come 6 months to a year after release date. Update: it's been almost 3 years and I still can't post slideshows
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I absolutely cannot stand the amount of bots all over. The fact that reporting these pages does nothing at all while they continually post inappropriate stuff and fake engagement with some amazing content creators. This is honestly ridiculous. And you can easily tell they are fake pages but somehow you guys can't figure that out?!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Is your TikTok live option missing or not showing on your Android device? Watch this video to enable the live option on TikTok from your device.

Because after analyzing the issue, here I will show you how to fix the live option missing on TikT"

There's inappropriate songs, videos that tiktok allows YouTube would be best for you and my brother searched cars and it gave him women in bikinis inappropriately."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,When I open the tiktok it doesn't open only show the icon and then it crashed you have to delete it or restart your phone and re install just to open it once. What nonsense is these please fix it.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,App constantly crashes seems super slow and when I close the app the audio continues to play unless I restart my phone. Used to be my favorite app. Womp womp

I'm moving to Japan to become a manga artist!! Too bad their banning it. I really enjoyed this app and it played a big part in my life."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I'm kinda upset with you guys and would like to talk to someone in charge you guys allow us to use songs you allow people to talk about so much and do a lot without being banned but you remove the song on your platform that was playing on a video for both my deceased friends this is not right and I would like someone real to fix this and contact me not send me to automative service please and for the video to be rightfully judged or i will never come back to app
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Its okay at best. They do have a lot that they could improve like the reporting system. I posted a comment, and I've had around 6 people tell me to off myself and/or ""Dew it"". I reported all those comments, but because it's a bot and they didn't just straight up say ""Kill yourself"" they didn't get banned or even a warning. The ads are VERY sexually suggestive and it's annoying, no matter how many times I say I'm not interested I still get then all the time. So the app has a lot to improve."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app I use it everyday but I would add one more star if there wasn't this glitch happening. I try to make an account, I click google and click the account, I put in my birthday but then it takes me back to the ""which google account"" screen again over and over. I don't know why it's happening but I find it annoying"

I was using tiktok on my main phone and then realised that the content I like wasn't showing up. The only things that were appearing were my country s cringe posts ( like a new user fyp). I have also tried clearing cache, data, even installing old tiktok versions with no success. I hate this thing because I cannot use tiktok on my main phone because I don't like it. On my secondary it works though..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Just a suggestion for the creators of this app if they read this: In search, I would like if the results are accurate. When scrolling through the results, you have random videos that pop up. Could you pretty please fix this issue?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Never had a problem but for the last few months it just decides to not open one day makes all other apps slow as well. It's not my phone bc when I uninstall everything runs smoothly.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I had an account for 3 YEARS and one day they randomly decided to permanently suspend it because I violated multiple guidelines. I read through the guidelines that I apparently violated and it didn't match up with my activity at all!

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I never really liked tiktok because of the type of content I was getting. I've always preferred YouTube as the algorithm recommends me videos I enjoy I used tiktok for about a month and still got videos I didn't like. I think the app is overhyped for what it is and although it isn't awful it still isn't great.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is entertaining. But despite the fact that tiktok is updated, and I live in the same region as others who use new filters, I am never able to see, find, or use those filters."

It shows im following hundreds but I follow like 30, who are the hundreds ? I cant find them nowhere, banned accounts probably?

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App started to glitch and lag in the middle of March. Videos won't start, some videos play with no sound. Used to work perfectly fine"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's a really good app with no adds like there's adds in video form but you can just immediately scroll pass them because in other apps you have to watch the hole add but with tiktok you can just scroll past it so it's a really good app

But for a week I've noticed my views have significantly dropped. I've read online that usually any problems with an account can be resolved instantly by the TikTok team but I have raised my issue a few times now and it hasn't been fixed.

Overall, it needs better quality, and you should be able to search for photos, not just videos. Edit: the transitions recently added were funny at first, but are EXTREMELY annoying and also makes me and others feel queasy."

It's been happening for ages now too and I like how TikTok refuses to fix it. Then we have the 'just watched' button. It's useless, it takes forever to get to the video, even if it's just one little scroll away. Please fix these problems"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Everything is good but the one thing I hate is that theirs a limit to how many people you can follow like there shouldn't be a limit change that and make it where we can follow as many people as we want. Now I hate that some of my videos are losing their sounds for no reason out of no where when a few months ago it was fine fix it please.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The adds are getting to be too much. I have them all turned off, report I don't want to see that content, and block creators who still pop up. I see more adds from random people than I do anything I'm actually interested. I'm using this app less and less the more it happens."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,App by itself is great but I was randomly banned and have no way to get my account back to my knowledge. I have had that account since 2020 and it is pretty important to me so waking up to find it completely missing only to find out it was banned was horrible.

Thank you for reading i hope this review helps you"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,No more music? This app has gone so unbelievably down hill. I'll be switching platforms that actually allows me to use music from my favorite artists. You're going to lose so many creators and so much money. This app is the next vine.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Get ride if the auto refresh. It's crazy annoying when you accidentally hit your page and go back and it refreshes. It should stay on the video you were watching. It's turning into all advertisements......

I.e Tiktok will not allow me to change my profile picture when it already has the permission. This is very problematic, as it gets in the way when posting videos. If Tiktok could update this problem, it'd be great."

I can uninstall/reinstall the app and it acts normal for a short time before the app goes right back to malfunctioning/freezing and the ""friends"" tab is gone again. I really love Tiktok and want to keep using it but it seems to only be geared towards Tiktok shop now, rather than connecting with the friends I've made. It's incredibly frustrating."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Why take away the search feature for followers/following lists? This is a really useful and important feature. Taking away functionality/features is never a good thing. This makes the app way more difficult to navigate and therefore less enjoyable. Also, those lists should be able to be sorted numerically and alphabetically. Lastly why is there no dark mode. Make the app better not worse. *Edit: search bar is back"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Here are my main two takes on tiktok: 1 - I miss the old way that we browsed for filters and whatnot. It was a lot more organized and easy than that weird little carousel we have now. 2 - when we go through our collections and unadd a video from our favorites, it automatically takes us to the top of the most-recently-saved posts; it's really annoying, especially if we scrolled down really far and are automatically taken to the top again."

The app is now muting content music due to copyright laws; these are the same songs the app has provided for years. The app also does not support the American 1st ammendment. If they don't like ur content, they'll create a community guideline they never had before. If u appeal their decision, they'll tell u that ur content has been removed & cannot be restored!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I rarely have any complaints about this app but my number 1 problem is this: there should be a way to sort favorited audios into playlists like videos. As someone who makes videos, I have collected thousands of sounds to use but most are almost completely unaccessible due to the amount of scrolling that would need to be done. If a feature to sort them was added, I would definitely give 5 stars."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like the app alot. I love posting and seeing a community i am in, mainly around art and shows and topics i am interested in. i do not recommend this app for 0-12 as people can say anything they want on the app and post CLOSE to anything they want. obviously if you post inappropriate things or show to much skin in a child it tskes it down. if you post something that sombody reports (whether a comment or video) it will be taken down. you also only get a certain amount of warming before acc bans"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Don't like that ads. I don't like when you are playing a game that an advertisement comes on and interrupts the game and / or when you're done playing the game you can't get it off the screen or close the game. I especially like the games because it helps with my memory but I don't play the games because of the interruptions.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I like creating and sharing educational videos on here. I don't really watch many videos though. The video editing capability is great! Sometimes it glitches pretty badly though and I've lost hours of editing because of that. I know it would be smarter to make the video on my PC and then post it to the app but I prefer to edit on the go since I cannot sit in a chair for very long. I can edit my videos on the treadmill which is awesome!! Resolution could be better though that's
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Too many ads! Too many content creators selling stuff. Lots of them don't even want to. I made a comment once (that was TRUE btw) & it was taken down but I see & hear so much absolute garbage & it's still there. Tiktok has lost its way & forcing CC to sell stuff is def not a solution (you caused a lot of snakeoil salesmen). Do better.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I don't know why the song path (audio) is not like before because for you to add a track is a problem. I think u should fix these particular problem Or you should bring back the other type not the updated one I hope my complaint will be put in to due concideration
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've had TikTok since it came out, and I never had any issues with it until recently. I don't know why, but it would essentially stop working all together. Delayed sound, video, and just overall poor performance. I thought it was my phone at first, so I've factory reset it, but now I have a little warning sign stating ""recent data has been collected on similar devices, this app may stop working on this device."" So now I'm unsure if I should install it again or not :l"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love the app it rarely has issues. It can be annoying when it prompts me multiple times about adding my contacts to my follows. The report function is decent, some things that are clearly against community standards are returned as ""no violations found"". Also a little annoying the amount of false info spread by fake experts, but hey that's life. All of that said, great UI, video editing capabilities, love the filters, great place to find entertainment and spread info."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Not that great if you don't have alot of followers. If your not generating money for them they constantly strike you for just about anything. You can see other people do exactly what you did but have the followers to not get a strike. So if you haven't gotten tiktok don'tConstantly glitching and wont do feed updates it brings me back to the same videos a lot of the time. Videos I upload sometimes glitch I get off of it and go to FYP and the song from my video will continue to play the sound
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Have had tiktok for about 2 years now and never had a problem. Loved it. But for the problem started about a month ago, where there was an ad for some product that I was interested in, so I clicked on it. I didn't get it. I also clicked on 2 other ads. I bought one of those 2. Since then, every 3-5 videos is a review or ad for the other 2 products that I didn't buy. It's frustrating. I don't want them. And I don't know how to stop seeing the stupid repetitive ads and reviews"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I installed this app for one person. After a few months of regular use, the app will no longer allow me to send that one person videos. I can see what they share and send text, but I can't use this app for it's designed purpose. I reached out to support on September 21 after the issue had existed for a week. I reached out again on September 26/27 and October 1/3/10. Not so much as a ""we working on it"". Apps fine when it works, but once it breaks it's done. Uninstalling now."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What the hell tiktok you changed the way people can report offensive comments and accounts not cool also I don't have the ability to add closed captions to my videos explain that to me, I don't have the ability to post 10 minute videos like other people on your app do explain that one to me tiktok? Why do I keep getting to that? I have a network issue. Please try again when I don't. Also, my FYP is showing that other countries and other languages fixit"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tik Tok has apparently lost the rights to millions of sounds. Everyday they lose more. videos posted years ago are getting muted. Even recent ones that were published and music chosen from approved selections are getting muted a few days later. It appears they are losing more daily. So something it took hours to edit and post may be muted next day due to them no longer having rights to it. Don't put in a lot of effort any more, it's a good possibility tik tok will ruin shortly after posting"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been on TikTok for almost four years, and I love it! The variety is awesome --everything from intellectual to chaotic energy abounds, from just about every generation and ethnicity -- and my fyp really does get me (well, usually!)!😅 As a Christian, I love the encouragement I get from other Christians who post on TikTok!❤ Also, as a creative person, I love being able to have a great platform for sharing my music, dance, and other projects ...and for being able to tell people about Jesus!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This app currently has serious functionality issues. Good luck replacing a sound when prompted. It'll just sit on a loading screen.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3 stars bc: 1st. There's no dark mode for android and it's not fair iPhone to have dark mode. 2nd. My wireless earphones are connected to my phone with 100% battery and they work perfectly fine on ANY other app but not on tiktok. From what I know tiktok uses phone audio instead of wireless earphones audio. Pls fix it
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love the app, but if you could PLEASE let tiktok's save to their own folder rather than my camera roll that would be amazing. It's such a simple but useful change. Edit: I am once again asking for the above change. Tiktok downloads don't have any sort of tag to them or anything so it's really annoying having to move them all manually. Additionally these weird promos are damn near every video nowadays."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I honestly <3 it it's great for spare time, but its bugging alot now and it annoys me a hell lot. Prob not for others, but for certain Samsung devices. Other apps run fine."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I deleted the app temporarily and when I downloaded again it forced me to make a candybarrrz2. I unlinked this page from my email and I'm receiving notification emails for my regular account but I'm only able to access reactivation for this duplicate account. I'm pretty upset.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I would give this app 5 stars but they are not consistent. Their 'community standards' only applies to some and not others. But super entertaining and great content on the app! It's my favorite app but their inconsistencies with who is allowed to share content that is 'against community standards' is a big turn off. I've seen some very disturbing videos that they refused to take down after reporting, yet will take down other content that is much less disturbing. Same goes for sexual content."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Great app!! With slight network issues it freezes from time to time. You can't scroll up and down. Freezing all the time you can't even scroll. This app should require some maintenance. It's getting worse. Updated and it's glitching again. Less freezing issues and glitching then it's alk gonna be fine. It mutes the music when going on windows. Says tt isn't responding half the time. App is malfunctioning freezes all the time and update takes half my phone memory App is gone down crashing
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app, but I am suffering heavily in moderation. My videos get taken down, but I saw a video on tiktok of ""adult content,"" and it didn't get taken down even after me, and probably a lot of people reported the video but besides that the app is fine 👌"

My repost button disappears then turns up randomly which I find is really annoying and I'm missing alot of features. I've tried updating which hasn't worked and I've also tried reporting it as a problem but nothing happened. I'd would really appreciate if you fixer this."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I personally feel like with the auto scroll function, it should automatically like a video and if the user doesn't want the video to be liked they just tap the screen once then it would unlike the video."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Ever since the new update, Stories have been completely borked and Instagram-ified, which makes a clear continuity break in the UX. You wanna like a story by double tapping like normal? You get sent to the next story twice. You wanna go to the next story by swiping right? You get sent to the next person. You wanna write a comment? You can't. Either send the creator a message, like it, or share it to a friend. There's not even a way to see the audio and you can't get it any other way. Tt pls fix."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love this app its so useful and teaches me things that I wouldn't know and the algorithm is amazing and based on your likes and super amazing for people to connect better then other social media apps because of the amazing features intergrated.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Two stars are too much. The app is working good, I mean not lagging at all and when I press on something it immidiately works so no problem with the system, unless your device is too old or your network is trash. I'm putting two stars because of how it ended up. You all will understand if i say ""fy"" right? The media is just messed up, and it's not only on tik tok but many other apps too, though tik tok has the worst users ever. And despite that, you don't even care of what is posted there..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"<The best feature I like most in TikTok is ""Use this/any template"", and I can easily edit videos with just 1 click and it's a great way to spend my free time. It includes all kinds of good content including art videos, templates, videography, photography, etc., where I can get all the benefits of the facility of uploading videos and tutorials of I also speak my voice poetry. Thank you:)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Its all TEMU ads! The platform was alright until they made the store a central focus among other tweaks that were solutions looking for problems, but the quality of most videos has been getting worse and worse. AI voices reading everything, low resolution videos that still have the previous tiktok watermark, and 1 out of 10 videos telling me to download Temu. And once things start feeling fine, the algorithm decides to spam me with stuff I have never shown interest in and never will."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Due to the new update, I can't really like reposted videos, and I can't do the swipe video thingy. Overall, it is fine for me. It's just those two I have problems with."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It is CONSISTENTLY removing the feature to speed up tiktoks because they want more watch time. I was able to press and hold at the edges of the screen to go to x2 speed, now that feature is GONE for me, had the ability to press and hold anywhere to get more options, including the option to select the speed of the video, and now the option to control speed overall is GONE! That is not the case for my friends so I assume I randomly got picked to be a part of this so they can see how it affects us."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The content on the app is enjoyable and, sometimes, informative. However, the new pinwheeling screen transition between menus is headache-inducing, and makes using the app 1000% worse.

My only issue presently with the application is not being able to schedule contents as a content creator and a business owner. Sometime devices may not be available at the right time for contents posting, if this feature is added I believe it's gonna be one hell of an app for creators and business owners to enjoy. Thanks. Best regards, Odaf"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Fun app, it would be great if you removed the ability for people to see who's saw your profile. It honestly feels one feel self conscious, which in turn make it feels like I'm using Instagram (Instagram just brings a lot of anxiety because people can't be themselves there). Tiktok feels more safe and fun. Oh can you stop asking if I want my contacts to see my account I don't want them to please"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,too many bugs are still existing. I'm not muted in any live however in some they cannot see my comments. Verified all settings on both ends and reinstalled app. Nothing fixes it

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Fair warning, this app is insanely addictive. I've had to uninstall it like 5 times just to keep myself off. I've noticed the algorithm is getting worse lately, it used to show me a large variety of content from lots of creators that I really liked. Now, it shows me the same few topics from the same 10 creators, even when I go out of my way to search things, like, and comment on other stuff that I actually want to see. Nope, doesn't matter.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Tiktok is great to watch short video or skits. The only problem I have is when you report a video and you click other it doesn't let you describe what is wrong with a video which is for me to report NO FLASH WARNING..... people who watch their videos don't expect flash in their videos all the time and go into a SEIZURE. When you click other it just wants you to select submit and be done with it instead of taking the actual time to read what a person has to say about the video what wrong with it

I know it shouldn't be that big of a deal but the lives be so unhinged,so abnormal and it's just getting on my nerves it's like basically an ad and I also have ads too but only some rarely times when I open the app. I just wish there was a feature where we can disable the lives."

This is getting outrageous. now when I look at my list of liked videos half of it is muted. Almost every Playlist of song is copyright. Fix your app tiktok.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Easy to navigate, you can scroll for hours, but actual fun creators are being given warnings for no reason left and right. 🫤 Also there are actually horrible people who are practically naked on this app (Women with thongs, tiny bras, Men with just boxers) And wearing ski masks, showing guns etc. No warnings or disclaimers, those videos can stay up forever. But an actual good creator posts a BB gun with a warning and disclaimer and all of a sudden the video is deleted and the creators banned. 🫤"

I followed the same person 100 times and still not working restarting or anything that it tells me to do isn't working either. I don't follow ppl fast."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have to wait over an hour because my ""video is being processed"" and then the engagement is affected because it got posted hours later than the determined time, not only that but the app has become tiktok shop ad you can barely find creators without scrolling like 20 ads. This app is just becoming less and less desirable."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I really loved this app and could spend hours on it. But it has become unusable. Every 5-7 videos you'll get a commercial. You can say ""not interested"" as much as you'd like it doesn't matter. You will get the same brand over and over. You'll get *constant*, daily notifications from accounts like ""you are the selected winner"", which are glaringly obvious scam/bots. When you report them for obvious scam links in their bio, TikTok says ""no violations found"". F this. So disappointed and annoyed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I haven't been able to save videos to my device for the past several weeks, I've updated the app, cleared my storage and cache, switched between wifi connection, and I still get an error message claiming I have to try again, in which it will just stay frozen until I cancel. This app is decent content wise, but the fact I can't save that content even when the content posters allow it is absolutely absurd and I feel as if it requires an update to that portion of the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Scrolling through your favorites is annoying. For example, you scroll down and down and find a deleted tiktok and you press it to delete from your collection and the page refreshes you back to the start.

It's annoying and inefficient. I liked being able to comment on someone's repost. Now though, to comment on a repost It's not gonna be in the original comment section of the video. I also can no longer download videos before posting them with the new update, which was a great feature to have. It would also be nice to be able to search slide shows."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Constantly flooded with bots, content is repetitive. Would like a function to find real or even local/nearby people and content. Instead I get clones of real accounts following me, messaging me for information. There is no practicality in social function. The editing process is clunky. Could use extensions that provide more personalized control of the experience. Ads are also becoming more intrusive and annoying. Many more notes, but it is what it is. Safeguards could be better as well."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Ever since I knew it was a thing I've had TikTok and enjoyed its capabilities. I am however leaving you with TWO stars as of right now. Your latest update is complete and utter trash. Slow loading, voice is slower than the usual when it comes to matching up with the video. I haven't gotten ANY notifications in days, among other issues. If this continues to happen I will no longer be using it. It's more of a headache than an enjoyment with captain LAG"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Recently I've had issues with the app crashing and freezing my phone unprovoked. Even with fast connection and a new phone w/ plenty of space, the app with freeze everything and I mean EVERYTHING. Can't swipe out the app, can't swipe/tap the screem, and the audio from the tiktoks continue playing even after I shut the app. This platform is going down hill. 👎"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The recent update keeps bombarding my fyp with live streams I am not interested in at all. I suggest an option to turn off lives from our feeds because not all of us are interested in watching live videos, especially ones I showed no interest in to be in my suggestions on my feed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Increasing restrictions. They provide songs to use then penalize for using. Ditto stitch or duet. Yet when outright duplicate identity theft won't do anything. Rules are random...entertainment encouraged but entertainers get strikes for own songs. It's becoming far less appealing and their opinion is all that matters. Have someone take a photo of me for duplicate scam account but that isn't shut down. They want concerts but mute concert clips. Play the game & bullies step right up though
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have waited for an entire year to have one update that everyone hss except from me, which is known as the photo swipe update. It has been more than a year and I have not been able to get the update. I had several updates available, such as photo mode ( when it zooms out and 3:5 frame ). However I still have not been able to do the photo swipe option. This is annoying, seeing that the update wasn't available for you, plus it was over a year ago."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"As much as I love the creators and art on the app, it's UI frustrates me to no end. With every update, I lose a feature that made things easier for me. I lost the timeline so I can't scrup through videos. I have no search bar for my following list so I have to search for people I follow in the main search bar, which is a hassle. When looking through people's TikToks on their page, the page will scroll down as you keep going through their videos. But doesn't do this on your favorites So annoying"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"they've pushed tiktok shop so much recently and now it's basically all I've had on my ""for you"" page. between the tiktok shop stuff, promo and sponsored videos and livestreams of those npc people I don't get almost any normal videos. and the screens for when you open your notifications now zoom in and out fast causing me headaches. making a tiktok with a sound now spins the entire page while it loads making me dizzy. do better tiktok"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app needs a feature to be able to hide persistent UI elements, I got screen burn in because of it. This is an issue reported by many users but nothing has been done to mitigate it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It doesn't open 9/10 through the app, weirdly have to ho through the store and open it but this doesn't even work the last few days so i basically am not using it and if anything the next time I'm able to go in I'll delete my account because what's the point!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Fix the search please. Every time I search for videos, it shows me 2 or 3 videos related to what i typed in the search bar then it starts showing random videos that aren't even remotely related to my search. It isnt until i back out of viewing the tiktoks that it starts showing more videos that are actually related to my search."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Love the app, but everytime I tap not interested on a video it gives me more like them instead of less. Also, it's overrun by bots liking and commenting under any comment I make, and trying to follow me. I'm sick of this algorithm issue. Also WAY too many tiktok shop ads now"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app is very bad app I can't even send messages to followers and it also run too slow no one should download this app Also when you open it It can take up to 10 minutes for the black screen and running slow
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok is great and I'd give it more stars, except ever since the update I can't send my friends videos. I've logged out logged back in, yay, I can send! Jk no just one video. I cleared my cache, yay! Jk no, only one, then they get taken off the list and I can't see them, but I can still text them, I just can't send videos. And it'll let me send to people I've NEVER SENT VIDEOS OR TEXTED! It's really frustrating not being able to share videos with my friends. Pls fix this 😭"

I try to follow some of the friends of mines and it just unfollows so yeah and they permanently banned me for absolutely nothing so 1/5"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Playback speed shortcut (long clock right side for faster or left side for slower) no longer works on Android (why would anyone click 3 buttons to speed up or slow down one video). this makes it unusable for me.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I don't know what is going on but I have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling just to get the people I'm following to show up at the top makes it very irritating because y'all won't fix it so now I have to unsubscribe to the ones I follow because I can't see them just your shop that I won't use.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I will say tiktok has discriminated android users as they never added dark mode on the android where as they add dark mode on iPhone and an update to see my oldest favourite videos without scrolling all the way down. Tiktok should add an feature where we could just click and see our oldest favourite videos.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,App had a bug this morning and I couldn't open it. Updated it to see if it will fix the issue and still wont open. I don't wanna lose my drafts.

But I'm having trouble with the app. It's not letting me send out invite requests to my followers nor can I post or see my live gift goal or can I see peoples profile pics when their up in my boxes, it just shows a black screen with their name on it if their camera is off. Plz fix the bugs, I'm a live creator and this is disruptive to my live stream"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Amazing!!! My only social media app to be honest, literally my only complaint was if i log into the app and my fyp just happens to be playing a song, I'll have to pause it before clicking off to look at my profile or to start recording because if not, im hearing the audio play as im trying to look for the sound i was wanting to use or when im trying to record just my voice. messing with the app as a whole, its just getting annoying"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have been having an issue with the app. This issue has been going on for a while now. Whenever I click on the TikTok icon to open, the TikTok splash screen logo appears for a second or so then closes. The app constantly fails to open. To resolve this, each time I have to uninstall the app, then reinstall and sign in then it works. Tried restarting device numerous times, clearing cache, nothing worked. Emailed your help email and that doesn't work. Please help with a troubleshooting solution."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app is completely stupid it allows you to create videos with the music that they provide but then they mute your videos for kopyrigte and the best part is its remex music to don't make videos they will mute them
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,So I have to give it four stars as recently ive been using a filter on the app but it keeps going off in the middle of using it and I use the filter for a challenge that I do on tiktok. It's the 100 greatest albums and 100 greatest movies filter
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Very bad glitch! Every few days, the app decides to start having random screen glitches. Now, it's making my screen spin which is basically like a strobe light, annoying and hurts my eyes."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, it's a good app. It's fun, but it takes up a lot of space, and every other video is an ad. It also takes up alot of battery percentage. Every other video is a promotion for a product. I miss the old tiktok."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. But recently I have problems opening it. I'm downloading it the third time this month now, just so I'll be able to open it for like a week or smth and having to delete and re-download it again... When I click on the app icon nothing happens. There's not even a black screen or anything, just nothing. Please fix this, because at some point I won't have the nerves to repeat this anymore..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's great app and all and I love using TikTok because it's fun and entertaining to get throught the day, I haven't found any bugs yet! But the reason I'm giving a four star I because my vids always flop like even if I put hours into a vid it'll just get low views. Like what did I do to get shadow banned or something? I even post content related to what people usually post but nothing ever happens"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app but the search filters are not working. There are never results when I usethe ""watched"" or""liked"" video filter."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app is the worst possible thing in exsistence. Before all of theese changes that I will explain later there was nudity and sex links. Then people started making innapropriate dances and the sounds weren't quite appropriate. Theese songs would feature the N word and similar things. Now there taking down really famous artists songs like Billie ellish and Taylors swift. Not to mention about 8 of my close friends got banned in 1 day. Now I can't open the app bc I am scared I got banned.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app, but for over a year now, I haven't had the playlist feature nor the story feature. I am on the latest update too!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's fun to make videos and it's quite addictive I use it every day but theres some stuff that needs to be removed but overall it's not to bad of an app and you can show your Xbox, ps, pc videos and just make your videos out of your camera. (There was a time where it said to turn on your location for your friends to find you on a map or it was something like that it only happened once but I don't want to see what happened on 22/12/22 again)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok is honestly the BEST APP I have downloaded, you can watch videos or make videos and post them, but if you want to make videos and just keep them, then you need to sign up, but what if you dont want to sign up? Why did they change this feature??!!! Edit:LIES I TELL U, DO NOT DOWNLOAD"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is fun with hilarious videos and content. The ads are a bit too much for my taste. However, since November 10th 2023 the app is not opening anymore. It's weird, a message appears after it crashes that claims the ""App Has A Bug"". I know some of us are thinking if the government has something to do with this sudden crash problems and supposed ""Bug"" after trying and failing to ban the app in the USA....but who knows what to think 🤔"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Most of the time when i open the app it completely glitches out my phone to the point it don't want to turn off when i press the power button multiple times. Another thing is that the room for characters in the comments section is sometimes annoying because an opinion is bigger than the character limit resulting in me deleting the entire comment because that said opinion can't be summarized withought crucial details missing
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am getting increasingly frustrated with this app. Sometime earlier this year my account was suspended and then later banned bc it was linked to another account that I didn't even know existed. Ive tried support tickets. No reply. I'm uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times, every single time it says ""youre account has been banned due to multiple violations of the community guidelines. I am unable to make a new account on my, log in to any other account on my phone. Not all but out of space"

I go to the help area click recover acount but it won't let me because ""the acount is suspended"" (the hacker uplouded scammy videos and deleted all my stuff) I go to the suspended acount help option and it cant find my acount. It's just an endless loop. I've submitted so many help reviews from the app and from email, but absolutely no response."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very annoying since i updated tiktok when ever i tap tiktok app it will keep hanging untill it shows ""tiktok isn't responding ""report"" ""wait"" ""ok"",this makes it so useless ..nothing works on it again unlike before"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Can be fun once you start uploading. I really like this app now that I've started uploading and editing inside of it. The editor is slightly more clunky compared to Facebook Reels or Instagram Reels(my very first experience with short-form content), but not as limiting as YouTube Shorts and it's 60 second time limit. You can either upload a bunch of photos in a batch as a slideshow or upload them one at a time to edit text and titles."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok is working well but wake up one day, and find out that all my favorite sounds and music is no where to be found and the worst thing is that if I should add another sounds or music to favourite I still won't be able to make use of it please resolve this and I will come back with 5 star ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Becoming worse every time they update it. They now have tiktok shop and they should have just made a different app for it. It's outrageous in prices. 45$ for shipping for an item that costs 3 cents. Absolutely ridiculous. I'm very close to leaving the app completely. I have been on the app since it was musical.ly and it seems like it just keeps going downhill now.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I had a glitch with the app so I uninstalled it and reinstalled it. After reinstalling the app, still have the glitch. Every time I open the app it keeps saying I have 23 new notifications under Friends. No matter what I do I can't clear it."

People can easily steal your content, get paid for impersonating you, and get verified. All while you get nothing. Report them you say? It's been done over and over with no change. And apparently people have to break laws for you to be able to report. The jurisdiction doesn't cover all countries. Not even the U.S."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, just some times it's glitches, I would like it if when you leave the app while watching a video, you could go back to watch the same video, and I would Like if there was maybe a pop up when you accidentally refresh your fyp that says like ""Are you sure you want to refresh"" so that way you didn't lose your video. But over all, lovely app"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of the application, as it shows such a variety of the human experience. It feels like what the internet was made to be. I understand the algorithm pushes more of what's interesting to me, yet, I am still able to search for other things and have them shared with me without it becoming the only thing I get or marginalized. it's not bogged down by multiple commercials and advertisements, which, in most apps, take away the enjoyment of the experience Asif khan"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good experience overall. I only need some more editing tools. Sometimes it's tough to select specific cuts of the audio I chose as a track to adjust how loud it is at given moments. I haven't been able to split the audio track to do that. I'm enjoying the experience but would love to know how to make sure my audience is reached. I'm a Portuguese speaker, but traveling abroad. How do I make sure Portuguese speakers find my video and how to make sure it gets recommended by the platform?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Kinda dumb that you can't change the aspect ratio on Tik-Tok. The videos I see on one of my phones fit the screen, the other phone I have I can't see the full video. The new update gives me the ability to go to the common to be able to see the full video, but I cannot see the full video the edges and everything, if I don't hold down to look at the comments"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Amazing app but 3 stars for this reason. Tik tok is a music app yes? Well as of this comment tik Tok is not renewing their license for music and will be muting millions of videos that have music which is so stupid. Tik tok will really no longer be a music app and a lot of people are wanting to delete tik tok for this reason.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Kinda lame you can only comment 2 sentences on a post. Then report scammers and they send a message back talking about they see nothing wrong with the page. But I guarantee they want click to claim the prize. Constantly see adds that I said was irrelevant and didn't wanna see no more. But I guess it's better than FB but that ain't saying much.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Have used this since musical.ly and I have always loved it but since the new update I cannot get into the app. Like every time I click on the icon on my home screen it flashes the black screen with the logo for a split second and then closes again.

I have tried everything from exiting and reopening, opening w/o wifi, clearing cache, and uninstalling and reinstalling. Nothing, its really frustrating, and nothing has worked.

Won't be much longer for me before I say goodbye, especially since I can't even use dark mode on pixel. Tiktok used to make me laugh and intrigued my interests every day, many times. Me and my brother were always sharing with each other and making references. Now it really sucks. I feel like you're just mining all day for 1 decent tiktok. Fyp sucks no matter what I do. Sad."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app takes up too much space on your phone. The updates are 100GB!? It's a distraction anyway, so this makes me delete it. Tuning in online limits my time on the app and helps avoid distracting notifications."

Bio should be 100 characters max, we should be able to block audios, and the blockable keywords should be increased to 200. Profile banners would be cool, too.

I reported it several times. They replied that using location is only available to select people when I HAD access to it just a week before, I explained this to them and they responded with the same reply. This is a STANDARD feature of any social media app and it seems like they don't want to fix it for me. I uninstalled and reinstalled and am still having the issue."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Works well except when you go to upload... 8/10 times it will crash or there's a massive delay. Maybe a little over critical but one other problem is, when you've uploaded a 10 minute vid, it remains in the TikTok cache which then depletes your device of HD room so you get constant reminders about remaining space. Apart from those two problems the app seems to work very well, hence the 4/5 stars."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,They only give specific people certain updates and editing things they only give people with high views those things. I've never gotten the photo swipe mode it's not fair to anyone. Don't recommend this app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Beware of sharing TikTok vids. I learned to recheck shared vids when sent by text msg.

My dms are not coming in, I'll get the notification but when I got my inbox it's like nothing has been received. I had to uninstall and reinstall several times and after a few minutes it happens again. I've started clearing the storage on the app settings and that does the same thing as reinstalling but it is very much a pain. Once the issue is resolved I will remove my 1 star rating."

I'd like to know how to remove photos out of a folder so that new ones may be put in. I'm been in the help section, perhaps I'm not understanding something. I think to tic toc is pretty cool. I just wish some things were easy to access and to select and layman terms /options like other types of apps."

Although there were no violations Even my posts decreased in viewership rates! The application takes a very, very long time to work, despite my strong internet, but it is very slow I hope you can solve this problem quickly and let me know its causes * Note: Very bad updates increase the negatives of the application and lead to its collapse"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Doesn't have dark mode on Android but they have it on iOS. Has Apple payed you guys for it to be exclusive? It's really bright and not user friendly. Especially when you browse the feed before going to bed is very unpleasant.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Saw video on TikTok but did not have app. So I tried to download it later to see same video and could not find it. what is wrong with the makers of this app. There is no way to find a video that you saw earlier. If I could give this app zero stars I would. Seems like It was designed by a bunch of five year olds playing With their parents smart devices .
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,it would be awesome if the Tiktok added a live option to the app in Pakistan server. It would make the TikTok experience even more exciting and interactive! I'm sure other users would appreciate that feature too.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love tiktok but lately it's been acting up. Less views on my content, hashtags have changed with how many people used the hashtag in their post, some have gone away completely and there is something going on with the recent update as of today. It keeps glitching. Please go back to what it was before and that includes the hashtags and stop monopolizing the views on videos."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't know what's happening with my feed lately, all I get are videos of people trying out filters and I have already reset my feed twice. it's literally so boring and repetitive"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,After last update it doesn't open.I haven't been able to enter for 2 weeks. It still doesn't work. Third repost: it still refuses to open. I'm unable to enter the app for about one month.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I wish to add dark mode to Android, but I always face a problem when I press save the video. It shows that it has been saved in the gallery, but when I go to the gallery I do not find it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm writing here hoping someone at TT might see. I've reported several times TERRORIST related content, with instructions to make IEDs, how to ship by mail, and targets. One user is even selling their how-to class thru your app. Every response has been ""no violation."" I've even sent a back channel report, but there was no response. Do better"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I removed a star because advertising has increased. If I see more increase in advertising, I will delete the app. New: The new page transition gives me a headache. Change it back, please."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Always loved the app and how tiktok has continued to advance. The new update though, when you click on a message or profile, the transition to the next screen is horrendous. At first i thought it was just my device, but it apparently is everyone. I'm not sure if it was an attempt to jazz things up or what, but, that definitely is a no go for me. Please take that out of the next update lol!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Repetitive videos popping up back to back even if I choose not interested. I've noticed when I view the creators store then go to a different person's store the item from the first person's store will appear and will continue to do this until I come across a live page.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"A Well made App, A good interface with texting videos and search bar. But the algorithm is a little unpredictable at times and can make the experience less enjoyable, also this app is being banned in some areas because of the way it's shown to children. Over all I give it 3 stars, I've been holding off on it, but I'm downloading it because its more popular. I recommend this app if you don't like YouTube shorts or any other short form of video."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app, for People who wanna download it I would 💯, so I gave it a 3 because of max limit for typing is to short Please make it longer I would have given it a 4 if it was longer but why 4 and not 5 well its because whenever I first downloaded it it asked what things would you like to watch I pressed arts and crafts but it didn't give me any of that? it's A great App Anyways."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is really cool and put together well but the only thing I have to say about it that makes me rated at 4 stars is that when you go to upload a photo just very little editing options and if you're wanting to upload multiple pictures you don't have the choice of what order they're going to... So please update your uploading options and editing software if this was done I'd rate at 10 stars!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Love TikTok but you get a 3, not a 5 because when we say we arent interested in a particular ad, you continue to show it ALL THE TIME. A lot of the ads are misleading with false claims, beauty products especially. Listen to us when we say we arent interested!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is great, but i had loggen out of my account and when i tried to log back in it would not let me.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Tiktok permentally banned me from the app so I can no longer use it though I didn't do anything against the community guidelines since all I did on the app was scroll and watch videos there's no point in for me to even have it installed because it won't let me make a new account or anything and it keeps popping up with how I was permanently banned and I click dismis and it continues to pop up
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I think that this app is amazing because it is super good and the fact that it worka on my old phone which is super good to hear and it give you good entertainment. tiktok actually never caused any errors in my phone because my phone is quite old and some app so cause errors but this app never did anything bad 10 out of 10 recommend
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,it keeps putting my videos that *I MAKE* as copyright for the sound when I haven't every copied someone's video I may have gotten the idea of a clip from a anime from someone but it doesn't mean I copied their video like I have the right to have inspiration from a video someone made and I can make it from the same clip but of course have different edits that go with it but apparently no you guys won't let me make my videos that people love watching username: narutoshippudenedits.exe pls fix it

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It wont let me save videos to my drafts nor post any or when i go to edit slideshows it makes the photos black and unable to edit. It's removing all interactions on posts and it's super laggy.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This application is not working correctly. Because when I record a video I couldn't use my favourite music. Even when I am looking for a music it doesn't work
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Every time I scroll on my fyp for a bit, it works fine at some points, then half the videos are black, and i can't see them, but I can hear the audio"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It needs users to be able to quickly find their own comments. It needs a date for all tiktoks. I can't find a way to delete one of my tiktoks. It's not clear how to remove someone from following me. It is necessary to be able to mute someone while watching a live. Like spammers. Still awesome.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Of late when I edit and click on the ""next"" option, in order to go to the hashtag section it not working. Am always stuck on the editing section, I tried to delete the app, clear the cache etc nothing is working"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My experience is that my brother committed suicide live on tik tok. The way you target people with suicidal stuff is ridiculous but at least you had to implement a 10 second delay because of it! Your app is disgusting and Is just helping this world become scum. Congratulations on being one of the most worthless things in life!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm giving it 3 stars for a couple reasons,it lags alot and on the photo swipe videos the photos don't load at all.then the lives,every 2 times I swipe up there's a live and when I try to skip it it takes me to the live instead of skipping. Also,when I edit any of my videos the text does not show up when I press done,this app is entertaining but it does need some touch ups."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I rely on TikTok the most when it comes to cheering me up, making me laugh, or just being on it when I'm bored! I'm glad there are so many people to make videos for the sake of others. I'm super thankful that we can just skip the ads even if sometimes the ads are fun to watch X3. I love all the topics and the different kinds of TikTok you can end up on. I first discovered it when it was Musically but it changed to TikTok soon after. But overall it's great! :D -Lee"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's fun it's easy I just wish that capcut up in like face filters were hosted on their side so you don't have to go download something so we can make a lot more content quicker and more people would use it and that you host the videos on your side cuz every app does the same thing it wants us to hold everything when you guys have way more money and it'll probably be tax deductible but still want to put the weight on us to carry everything we already have to make all the content that takes up s
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I am incapable of seeing 'Display' so that I can change it to dark mode, I've seen my friends tiktok stuff, and they all have it. Tiktok on my phone has already been updated, and it annoys me that I can't see it."

It tells me my e mail and phone number aren't associated with my account @Mystiquerose69 I had so much content already, It is like stealing all my personal creations and pictures. I've tried contacting tik tok, but they have no direct customer phone numbers or any other way to communicate with people in case you get hacked."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's okay, but there's a bug when your searching videos. When I search something up, the first few videos are related to what I search up, then its random stuff, or if im searching up a show, it will show the results of the show, then start focusing on one character instead on the entire show. It is extremely annoying and I recommend you fix it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good! But for some reason the ability to continue recording a draft is not there?? I'm really confused why it isn't working, that's how I make transitions by making a bunch and putting them into my drafts but I have to record out of tiktok in order for it to work."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,If you have a Galaxy your filters are not going to work I've written them and they have not done anything about it. When you report a problem there AI technology scans it and just gives you a general statement nothing that actually helps Plus when you're alive hours sometimes a day after you end your life they suspend your live for no reason The appeal process is fake

They have one for IOS and even the web browser version, so why leave out Android? Honestly a huge bummer. Other than that, app's great"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Last update did nothing but ruin the app. Took away my ""favorite"" contact from the send bar. Still in my friends list, but not in the ""share to"" bar. No word from customer support in 3 days."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Chinese Malware brainrot aside, The fact this app is location based makes it even worse. Not everybody makes content meant for people in their region. Tiktok only pushes your content to people in your country regardless of the language you speak or the tags you use. Disappointing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My videos went from having good engagement to TikTok flagging almost EVERY SINGLE ONE of my original videos/pictures or just not pushing them to the FYP. I have been trying to contact them for a MONTH and have gotten nothing but automated replies. Support does not work.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's an okay place to waste time, but if you're on Android, more than half the time someone sends you a tiktok link outside the app or just sends you to the play store."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Would give it a 5 star, but they keep updating the app ruining it! you can not like reposts anymore or even use the comments in the ""normal"" way, I hate how they keep updating to stay relevant, but does tik tok not know they are tik tok? It was perfect as it was. They could at least make it a setting where you turn it off and on (the new updates of comments and reposts). Please listen to feedback b/c people agree with me"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's a really good app for fun and giggles but there's a lot of content that is absolutely a no go for me. Tiktok certainly entertained me for a really long while and it still does depending on its content.

How bad do you actually need our location? Like why just why? Even google doesn't make it this hard to change contents region entirely. I feel like I'm just stuck with low quality and trash contents from my country, go put the limitations off like IG/YT for god's sake."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,If you want people to stay on this app a lot needs to be fixed. 1) Deeming my videos Ineligible for FYF for unoriginal and low quality is getting old especially when I've read the guidelines and my videos don't go against it. 2) Videos being taken down for violating a community guideline but you don't specify which one and there is no option to appeal it 3) Muting a ton of videos because you couldn't compromise with UMG. THIS IS ALL SUPER DISCOURAGING.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is just a time waster. You'll get locked in a death scroll of consuming content that is specifically chosen to enrage or upset you just to bait engagement. So if you like less free time, less contact with the real world, being constantly shown upsetting imagery of dying/injured animals, being around groomers and genuinely horrible people, and spiraling mental health then this app is for you! Seriously tiktok, clean up your app. It's no wonder you're getting shut down."

I used to get tiktok content on my fyp from all over the world, and now my fyp won't show me anything but my own country's tiktok content.. which I don't want to watch. Please tell me how to fix this because it is frustrating, and if I could give 0 stars, I would because the app is not entertaining if you can not watch content from all over the world."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Amazing app in love with the really good communication system(sorry for sounding like a nerd lol) and the editing system and addition is a really refurbished touch to it so you can make as many videos as you want :D
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app I have loved it for a long time but I have a suggestion, you guys should make a feature where you can make a video visible to only certain friends/people. It would really be helpful"

Now, I've decided not to use TikTok. I feel comfortable with people who use tiktok, but to be a little real, it made me miserable. Do what you want with this information."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So far as I have started using this app more and more recently, it has come to my attention that when it comes to their community guidelines, it's a very biased app. For example, it will accuse you of saying things even though it wasn't the case (in my case, I was responding to a comment and it was flagged as if I was trying to endorse or get likes which wasn't the case at all). Also, when you go to dispute what was taking down, there is no real place to go. You just go in a circle over and over"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I like the app but they load ads first which compared to actually loading videos that creators make commission on. If you have iffy service Good luck. You don't get to actually watch enjoying videos.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Good story content but the problem is that I purchased 200 coins twice and my coins were taken even though I wasn't watching the app. I opened up the app to watch and all my coins were gone.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,If you don't want people to use music in their videos on tik Tok then why do you provide music on tiktok you should remove all the musics but when you do that you're going to probably lose a lot of people using the app provide music that people can use that's free to use if you cannot provide that I'm pretty sure that everybody that uses tik tok can probably find some other app that they can use provide free music to use in videos

I was just minding my own business trying to read when I get hit with a tik tok ad. Not at all a problem if it was just the one ad. I had to sit through 5 different tik tok ads one right after another. what I mean by that is I got the ad, clicked the x and it brought up an interactive ad instead of a video. I had to click the x 4 more times after that. I shouldn't have too deal with that. what the hell tik tok."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I would of never thought I say it but your developers are ruining the TikTok app with dumb updates. TikTok you should test a feature with people or give us a classic setting to avoid it. One star is for countless dumb updates.

You can say whatever you want without getting in trouble for no apparent reason, and there is no ads you gotta skip, just scroll on by and continue watching these tiktoks. It's absolutely amazing. But, I don't like it when it sometimes glitches out or lags. Overall though, it's a great app. A lot of funny videos on here too."

It all acted like it uploaded and posted but no sound. Yes my speakers work, no it's not a business account.

Fix my issue and it will be 5 star

Makes it hard for the FYP to actually show me what I'm interested in, and an uncanny vibe watching creators tip-toe around using banned words. Also, ads have gotten out of control.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really love this app, I love how you can see the whole world by an app, this is really entertaining, we can make new friends by following eachother and describe ourselves by sharing videos, it is my best experience among apps, but I would like to request two things,1:call , it would be very nice if there was a call button 2:save button in photos, videos it would be amazing if u could add these we can see the photos, videos in gallery and not swiping up(sorry bad English, second language)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"it's a good app but sometimes it's cheeks. I've been stuck on millenialtok and Superbowl videos and I do NOT want them, even after spamming refreshing, reposting videos I like and favoriting videos I like AND removing hashtags, it stays the exact same."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Tiktok is a very good app. I would recommend it if you're looking to download it. You can text your friends and post about daily life and anything you want. So i would recommend getting it
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is getting worse and worse. Nothing but advertisements, the same old broadcasts begging for gifts, and no new exciting videos. This is the beginning of the end for tiktok. We can all see it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I had this issue with tiktok FOR YEARS, please put dark mode as an option, I know it's possible.... I've been saying it countless times. Using this app since 2017. Algorithm also is not really the best."

It worked before and now when it posts the video pics don't get views even though I add hashtags too please fix this problem it's very concerning now Please fix it ASAP Thank You

I can't believe it! I have more bad things to say about this app! When I was trying to report only the other person's direct message to me and it also temporary banned me. I'm not sure why and I'm trying to get myself appealed. Why couldn't I just report the one person and not me?
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app used to be a great app... Nice place to go chill watch some short vids make some short vids have a good laugh or cry or anything in between..Now they are trying to change it to video making like YouTube... Huh why... Now they keep updating stuff and my comment section don't work right my comments go to the wrong video...Oh and not to mention that they lost their music copyright contract now all the hard working creators that don't get enough recognition also have muted videos... What 🤯
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Ordinarily I use tik tok quite often but lately there has been an issue where the cache data builds up so fast it floods my storage and I have to clear the cache daily just to clear room I've even had to delete other apps just to make it work
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I like how the content is directed to a person's interest. It's not as business minded like other apps and that creates opportunity and a niche to monopolize. They make it easy to give but sometimes I wonder if the people actually receive what is given because I can't even find where people should add there bank account
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm getting sick of this app cause 1 it said my video was violating community guidelines by NUITY, when the video HAD FULLY DRESSED ANGELS AND A DEMON and also IT WAS A SONG COVER. 2 TikTok glitches me from one video too a totally unrelated video and 3 IT COPY RIGHTS SOUNDS THAT ARE LET ME REMIND YOU IS ORIGINAL!!! BUT IF SOMEONE ELSE TRYS TO USE THE SAME SOUND I GOT COPYRIGHTED ON THERE PERFECTLY FINE!!!? 4 it repeatedly has ads that are not only every 3 regular videos but FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Settings need to be more detailed. If i want to change my wallpaper for my tik tock profile, i do not feel tik tok should be changing my wallpaper settings for my phone. It took me ten minutes to fix but not my point. Change the settings so if i want to use a picture for tik tok profile, it will not change wallpaper for phone."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Users are awful, basically reddit 2 when it comes to the bullying. Reports don't work half the time, I also keep getting videos that I don't want to see shoved in my face even after clicking the not interested option. Algorithm sucks all together, also a ton of people I follow have gotten banned at least once for seemingly no reason? You also can't really block tags you don't want to see on there as far as i can tell, only filter out comments. Plus with the mass muting of audios, it just sucks."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I wish we could use it in dark mode. Thats my main problem with it. Secondly the app glitches a lot. It doesnt work smoothly. I hope they fix these weird bug issues asap...
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Should be an option to remove all videos that have something in the tiktok shop. I'm getting sick of seeing it. Idk if it sticks around I just don't want it on my feed. On a side note everytime I report scams they say they didn't find anything and that's bs. Anything that has a $ as there picture are scammers and need to disappear
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Have gone through cycles of deleting it. One reason has been, several times, while it's been downloaded and not in use, the phone has mysteriously shut down. Has not happened when tiktok is not downloaded."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've learned more from this app than I did in school, from the news, even hacks that seem so practical my parents should have taught them to me. It's a shame that's the case. I know a Chinese company owns the app and is subject to full transparency with its govt. I've weighed the options, and still choose to use the app. Knowledge is power and the truth will set you free. There, I said it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's good but the ads are messing me up, when I don't even swipe it still takes me to the ad page and such, the new updates like the repost button moving I don't like but besides that it's a good app to past time, I would recommend it!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app always restarts or crashes whenever try looking at videos when searching also when trying to comment. And yes I've updated the app even removed it and redownload also clear cache in my phone settings.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There is always an issue of like and follow, I have reported it several times but no response, it's really a rude behavior for such a popular platform. I request from tiktok team to kindly look over this matter and resolve the issue of the likes and follows. Whenever I like or follow someone it doesn't added to my followers list. Hope team tiktok will take it seriously. Thank you."

I highly recommend it for those seeking entertainment and inspiration!"""
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is great, but I hate that android users like me are left out from getting dark mode and many other features that apple has. I recently got a new phone, but my old one has the post video button and the like button burned onto the screen"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The new update isn't sending shared videos until the next day after, and even then it won't show all of them until even more time has passed when before it was pretty much instant when you shared videos"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They give guidelines to follow. Like do not post videos of crimes being done. If you go report a video of a crime being done they will tell you it's not a violation. But they take down videos and delete accounts of people who didn't do anything. Also ADs are getting ridiculous, like YouTube bad now. I get a AD every 3 videos now. Also I can't block certain key words I don't want to see. Why can't I block certain words?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ever since the music went away on a music app, it sucks. A lot of the content creators don't pop up on my fyp anymore. Let me know when there's music on here and I'll download the app again🤗"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Not nearly as bad as it used to be. Wish there was an easier way to navigate friend list. Wish there was a recent tab in effects. Wish tiktok would actually close impersonator accounts to negate some spam.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Unsatisfied with the company. They keep messing up the creators on the app and that's not right. A ton of videos are now muted due to ""copyright"" which is not true when the creator is the one posting the song. I'm glad the app works like an app should, for now, I guess."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Haven't used this app in over a year, as it is addicting and I needed to stop. Friend sent me a clip to watch, and somehow, my account was suspended.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Algorithm for removing posts and appeals to removals is both opaque and random. I have no faith at all in either or both processes. This must be improved. It is the worst I have seen on these platforms.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tik Tok is no longer that wall safe app. Sometimes it gives the issue of age. Sometimes it gives the issue of what. My age is more than 18, but the issue of live is there. I have given feedback many times, but not live. My open. Happening"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app, great in fact, but the only issue is that they muted half of the popular sounds and saying that they are copyrighted even tho they are original and when I try to download a video it downloads a wrong video or doesn't even download it and when I like a video and favourite it it removes the like, like I just favourited the video without liking it. Don't like the issues, hope they get fixed soon, overall great app!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Between getting randomly banned and the horrid automated responses by customer service, being berrated by TikTok shop ads and the recent changes to ""the algorithm"" this app is becoming less and less entertaining. If you're a new user it's probably going to be a great experience but as a ""veteran"" user it's now very lack luster. Download at your own risk"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is me editing my review because TikTok has become my favorite app by far. And I like all the videos I watch, this app is simply the best. However I believe it's high time we get the dark mode feature for the app. This would make it way cooler because the glare is just too much. I hope developers review this new comment and see how best it helps, thank you!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've had a lot of issues with tiktok removing my re-posts and likes from videos. There have also been certain features removed. The last 3 weeks I've noticed my FYP just repeats, or will show me VERY old videos. A LOT of glitches lately. Disappointed"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I used to enjoy this app but now every other video is an ad. I reset my feed but that didn't help. no longer entertaining like it used to be before TikTok shop. between TikTok shop and sponsored ads there's nothing else to see.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app works just fine. I just switched to Samsung after having an IPhone my whole life. I love the phone, but found out that Apple paid off TikTok to only have dark mode on Apple products and not android. TIKTOK gets the biggest thumbs down for making me lose my eyesight everything I'm on the app."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,the new video squish when you pull up comments is AWFUL! i used to love pulling up comments over the video. it was sometimes funny and sometimes a needed break from what was playing on the video without having to pause it. boooo
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's a nice app but I would like to have subtitles in English for all the videos because I follow a lot of Spanish content creators and because of the language barrier I can't understand them It only show subtitles in Spanish and I don't like it
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It has been wonderful, but there's a challenge, the rate at which the quality of a video is being reduced to is something else, how will I take my time to make a video and edit it only for me to post it and it's looking like a video short with a Java phone, it's frustrating and annoying"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Honestly great aside from the stupid green screen your own story button. Kinda blocks a good portion of the screen which is kinda annoying when you're trying to watch a video. Other than that solid
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's a nice app but when I post a slideshow atleast one of my pictures with words on it has no words. Even when I check after posting the video I see the words then the next day they gone

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The ads have gotten way to frequent every 5th video is an ad now and it's the same ads over and over. The app has also been flooded with bot accounts posting other users content it's difficult to see any engaging content anymore it has definitely gone downhill
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Updated the app, and now the comment section only shows up as a black screen, and moved the video to the other half of the screen while on tablet mode.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I hate the new comment I am unhappy with the new way of viewing comments on the app. I think that the new feature, which shows the comments on a separate screen instead of overlaying them on the video, is bad for the user experience. I think that this feature makes it harder to watch the video and read the comments at the same time, and that it disrupts the flow and continuity of the content. So plz change it"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's cool but after getting a new phone no matter what I do when I make a video it's slow motion at first and then the audio lags. I've tried everything to get it up to speed and nothing.

The tik tok reel is about tik tok guessing your mental illness. It showed up eating disorder when I played. I was appalled because it is the truth. I said, ""The truth hurts.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Character limits and lack of ability to edit typos lead to harassment and unnecessary pings from hundreds if not thousands of immature individuals. It can be as simple as trying to type can and typing cab instead. Now you got dozens and dozens of notifications of people saying *can. If only we could edit the message to replace the typo. This character limit is about 20-50 characters too small. And it isn't even consistent. I'm also being impersonated and Tiktok finds no conflict with that.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Best app since likey if tiktok updates it just a little better like where there's more filters and you can create your own filters no matter what device you're on I mean that would be a life-changing experience especially if you didn't have to pay or try to be famous at least but for me I'm not really famous because no one really likes my tiktok but hey we can say tiktok is the best app.

Issue is not happening with videos liked from my FYP nor on my Pixel Tablet. Please fix!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love tiktok but recently they removed many of the very popular trending sounds and now people are getting less views and less songs to use. Please fix this, thanks but other than that it's really great."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm rating the app 3 stars because it's a very good app, and fun but lately the app is messing around, deleting comments, not allowing people to recharge, banning account without warning, you'll just wake up and your account is banned💔💔. Please fix the bugs, and that gets blank and the boom ""TIKTOK NOT RESPONDING"" please fix this."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"For some reason on my second account on here I can't see the favorite button at all as in it's not even a choice, and yes I updated the app and cleared the cache but it still isn't working if you know how to fix this please tell me."

This is a crucial concern for me as it impacts my experience on the platform. I appreciate TikTok's features but would like prompt assistance in resolving this matter to continue enjoying and engaging with the app effectively."" It is very Requested to you that solve my problem Best Regard @ahmadwazir471"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,How is it even with the update something as simple as removing sound added in the middle of the clip isn't possible but we can remove the filter? And why can't I keep recording on videos in my drafts section? This is ridiculous
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Use it often but every time I try to post a slideshow with over 9 slides the app crashes in posting, my only solution is to delete the app and re-download it every time I want to post. PLEASE FIX THIS"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Bring back the music! Make a deal with the universal music group and bring those sounds back. All of those editors' hard work has gone because of you. Do that, then I'll consider boosting up my stars for you."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is great.. I love it! Wonderful sharing all the wonderful foods I cook and seeing other people's foods from around the world. Also, the diversity of the videos is wonderful."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It is amazing and it has it good sides and it bad sides but mostly it is a fun way to express our feelings and it is a bit hard when u start but otherwise is is a fun platform to do what u love and and show all urban talents hope this was helpful
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Can't like other repost. Used to be able too then 2 updates ago it went away. Thought they would fix it by this recent update. I have reinstalled app several times and I just want the ability back. My friends have it why can't i.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"dropped it from 5 to 4 stars, there is too much censorship, my last comment got censored and all i did was quote 3 words that were in the video, also they are pushing landscape mode, hold phone sideways to watch, been using instagram more as less censorship and more worldwide content, tiktok only shows me american and canadian content with just a wee bit of european and australian content, hardly anything ""world wide"", also tiktok comments are not long enough"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Enjoying this app but getting annoyed that ads are starting to appear in the middle of videos don't mind seeing ad videos scrolling but having them pop up in the middle of other videos is a bit too much
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I'm tired of using sounds and y'all either mute my videos and copyright them and I've been using this sounds for a lil over a year now and ur just wanting to copyright or mute my stuff. This app has gone so far down hill.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Quit removing sounds that don't actualy have copyright issues! And I know full well they don't because you keep the exact music on tiktok! So many scams that don't get taken down. And videos can be reported by the hateful and physical criminals in a creators content and have that awareness of them removed but also leaving up their content with the same ""guideline violations""."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Used to be a great format, but content is too long now. They're pushing creators for 1min+ videos and it's not working. Missing the vine energy it used to have."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I'll be on it for hours sometimes I download it as a joke and it turns out to an addiction it showed me a lot of items that are great for my skin and it's really helpful it recommends items and there's a tick tock Shop with a lot of good quality items and I think it's just the best app ever so I'm going to give it a 5: star I will admit though there's like people who bully you
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"WTH, no dark mode on Android. I have been waiting ages for dark mode on this app for my phone Poco F2 PRO and still nothing. Apparently Android had it first. Well I don't have it or see it. Useless updates still no dark mode for my phone. Most app developers would have made sure there is a manual option for dark mode. Clearly tiktok has got the most ignorant developers on the planet besides being 💩 💩"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The amount of sponsorships and ads is incredibly high. It's basically like I'm on this app for people to scream at me about how good the ear clinging stick is or how amazing pickled chomoy kit is. 9/10 videos are just ads
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Will somone fix this app that won't let me sign in using Facebook. I've tried everything and everyday for like a month now. I have even contacted customer service and they haven't responded and its been over a month! I can't sign in!😤
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Year 4, the app just doesn't work anymore. I open the app, the I wait 2-3mins for a video trying to load, then then app shuts down. All my other apps work, my Internet works."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"One day I logged onto tiktok to find my account perminately banned, Ive never posted anything against the guidelines. I only posted about a silly story I made about cats (following the rules). I wiped the data from the app, still banned. Deleted and reinstalled it, still banned. Erased all information and storage on that app. STILL BANNED. I can't even use the app without an account. I will never ever be able to watch tiktok again for no reason. What the hell tiktok!?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's alright for now but when I try to do # and stuff it doesn't show me how many views the # has. Oh yeah and sometimes when I am trying to use a sound on TikTok to post a video it kicks me out of the sound and my screen goes white for like 5 or 6 seconds but other than that it's alright I guess
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If I could give 0 stars I would. The reporting system is so broken. I've reported someone's account because it has incredibly inappropriate content, but apparently no violations were found, and I saw a video where a solider was being treated horribly so I commented that I feel bad for the solider, and my comment got removed without any specific guideline I ""broke"" and when I went to appeal the only process was pressing the appeal button, and my appeal was denied"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"There's changes. And the new changes I hate, theirs, stem, what is stem? I don't need stem. And if you stay on TikTok for to long maybe look like an hour this screen will pop up say ""are you ready to take a break?"" And you have to put the numbers 1-2-3-4 . And there's other things that I don't have but other people do. I don't have TikTok shop but one of my friends do. And my friend told me to update it but I didn't have to. So what's up with that?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My inbox messages disappeared completely, it would not let me receive or send videos privately to my friends, I has to uninstall and redownload for it to work for like 5 minutes and then it crashed again."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,So far they fixed the issue of the text not showing but now for some reason the txt gets downsize I have to upscale the size super redic so it shows the way I like it. Anyways is working we good... for now 😂
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It kept acting up and I restarted my phone, deleted tt and now it won't even open. I cant sign in my acc at all and it says I have no Internet when my Internet is perfectly fine. I've reported it and nothing back. I understand it might take awhile to see the report. But it's annoying at this point."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I have had tiktok for many years and I loved it so much! And I still do a little but I would not download it in 2024. Because they are removing all the good sounds that people listen to they are going bankrupt. Cause they did not continue to pay for the sounds.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok keeps freezing up. Only way to temporarily fix it is by closing it fully and reopening it, only for it to freeze again a few minutes later."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I AM NOT going to use an app eith both pop up ads and scroll through ads. I was ok with opening the app to an ad and occasionally scrolling onto one, but them popping up midway through a video? Nope."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Promote is still messy, not clear how much it costs, how much will you need to pay, it shows 1 price but always have to pay much more and doesn't specify what is that difference for. Refunds are not immediate and not clear when or how much you'll get. Not easy or even possible to get support."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,this app mysteriously automatically downloaded itself onto my phone. I have uninstalled it before due to the massive waste of time it has become. it looks like this app is becoming less trustworthy if it's forcing itself on my phone.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I have this problem where I'm missing features like repost and dark mode is not about my phone either my friend have a worst phone than me and he still get those features. I tried clearing my data and cache just to have the repost button back but when I go back onto tiktok is gone
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Latest update is garbage. Sound stays on when you click on other apps, ads every third video, re-arranged location of buttons, will not allow you to report hate comments/accounts."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This latest version has been soo amazing like very fast and convenient. The only amend is the post visibility especially in a rural area.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Nice and amazing app, but i need a favor from you guys, make it easy to have ""mobile gaming option"" button. Also, i have an advice, why dont you have share with PlayStation to add ""tiktok"" on broadcast field area, starting on ps4+?

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok was working just fine until after recent updates, now when sending private messages, it so slow. Messages were instant before. Now can take up to 30 seconds to send"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The algorithm sucks and it is over 2/3 of just adds at this point. They have started putting ads in the middle of three minute videos. Absolutely terrible.

Tiktok please can you fix it🙏🥺"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love tiktok, and making video tiktok has changed a lot over the years and now muted videos with a number of artists. How can you remove music from app literally basted on music like just Ruined the whole app 😒"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Cause i don't have to swipe slideshow and I'm going to delete it if everyone doesn't get it so tiktok change it. I would like the slideshow to be in the new update for all phones.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tik tok needs to be more inclusive when it comes to phones. I have a samsung and it wont let me use most of the filters. Not everyone has an iphone. (Update) it logged me out of my account and wont let me back in despite me providing my username, password, and my instagram that is connected to it. There is NO REASON it should not let me in."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Features always changing for the worse (removing repost comments, removing manual translate button, still no dark mode) moderation is very bad (spam bots everywhere, your comments can get deleted even for valid criticism) many things not working (FYP not aligning to interests, web version works better but does not have slideshows) support not answering at all (even if they do it's only for security and even then it's an automated response like you haven't read the faq????)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Trash. I got a new phone and when I tried to open my account on my new phone, said my account was suspended... for a whole month all I got was auto responses and dummies repeating previously stated steps that didn't work in reuniting me with my page. So now my page is dying and I did 2 years of work for nothing. They sensor too much. If your a content creator, I'd use another platform."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Moderation is a sick joke. Blatant threats and hate speech are allowed but using an emoji they loaded into the program isn't. It would be best to get rid of moderation altogether. What's the point of a ToS if only minor things are considered violations. Also, when searching videos, it's not long before the app starts to lag to the point of uselessness."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The worst app ever. Uninstall it! Content is incredibly boring made by people with absolutely zero skills and very childish senses of humor. Wish I could give it 0 stars instead. Even worse I get tiktok ads on my phone hundreds of times a week. No I won't ever install again even if I get a billion more tiktok ads 👎
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The algorithm removes my own content from the fyp that I recorded and edited for being ""unoriginal."" It doesn't get more original than that. Then, when you go to appeal it, you get zero response. Not a soul will check your appeal for weeks... by then, it's too late, and the damage is done. It's beyond infuriating."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I honestly find it sad how more features are available to IOS than Android. They've got features added like dark mode and being able to post slideshows, and Android is blocked from these features. How is that fair? Why can't all users on whatever platform get to experience these features? Would've liked this app more if it were available to Android too."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I love tik Tok because of the songs that they play on their but I hate that they're blocking the songs and I hate that you have to put the password every time that is very annoying and you're going to lose a lot of people by blocking the songs and putting password every time.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I use this app pretty often, but now it doesn't allow me to save my drafts or photos without a watermark. it's so sad that all my drafts are unusable for other apps, and i no longer take pics with the app. You should fix this asap 😔"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,There's a really annoying widget at the top left corner of my screen when I open the app. It's an ad to get you to share the app with more people.

But now, it's just unqualified, insincere every day people telling you you should buy something through them, and it flat out says on the ad that they get a commission. Tiktok is just ads now."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This app was great until you decided to get on bad terms with UMG and not pay them properly and the recent update where the video gets smaller when you open comments is not good you should make it an option in settings so we can choose but otherwise I guess it's okay
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Get rid of the recent update! It causes glitches, and it's super annoying for all these page transitions etc. The transitions serve no purpose but to annoy!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,When my old account was banned and I made a new one it won't let me text or send videos to people. Overall it is a great app Its just that problem if I cold text and send videos it would be a 5 out of 5 rating. Please GET BACK TO ME whenever you can.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Tik tok is a great app, I love this app. But the only 3 problems are is that if you go in to Tik tok some users videos are muted which is really annoying, and they give you a guideline LIKE WHAT in the whole world, anyone can use Tik tok why do they DO this. And you Have to sign up!?!?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,My tiktok has been glitching like crazy when I upload it's not even getting views I have to delete and reupload again and again like so many times until finally I start getting views and I even tried like deleting the app and install it again idk what's going on but it's frustrating 🥲 tiktok please do something about it cause I'm not the only one 😪

I report the profiles and they somehow aren't in violation. I block 3-4 of those profiles each day! It's ridiculous."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Censorship of human rights content on this app is blatant. I've recently found the ""follow"" button to literally be missing from certain pages. I used to think that this kinda censorship was only a problem on meta but it's gotten really bad here too. I want an app that actually shows me the content I want to see, not cherry-picked content that someone somewhere has determined to be safe and allowed to go viral."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"this app worked like a dream for a very long time, but recently it's a nightmare. If I am sending something to a friend (and that if I am lucky enough and the app isn't behaving like that account does not exist), that person receives it two business days after. I really don't understand how is this possible, to go down so bad."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,App is total garbage. Can't get any help. Got a new phone and now can't get into my account. Have made several reports and have got no where with no help! Better to not even download this app nothing but issues. Also have the most updated version and still no tik tok shop? Where is that tic tok shop?
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Tik Tok has improved its user interface slightly. The overall level of convenience is still far too kludgy for those not systems friendly.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"For some reason my for you page filled with unrelated videos. I've had this app for 5 years now and it never happened before but 2 days ago my for you page filled with ad videos and videos unrelated to the stuff I like. I spent years trying to build a for you page with things I enjoy and now tik tok gives me videos like I never even used the app before. Please fix this issue, even if I click the ""not interested"" on videos I don't like, the app shows me the same type of video."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This app accesses your phone volume without your permission. Doesn't matter if the app is running or not. I do recommend this app for that reason. I can't fathom why this app needs access to my phone 24/7 it's a data hog as well.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Was using the app a lot and liked it, but when I switched phones, the option to download drafts was gone while my old phone still has the option on the same account."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is very good, the problem is that when one of the videos I upload deletes them, for example I had a video with 30.7k and I deleted it, they should review more when people report it like crazy."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app, except the photo thing you can film with is supposed to be a smaller screen. Yet it is the exact same as if I had pressed video. I don't like that bc I LOVE using the photo screen for my videos. Please fix this thanks❤️"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Why it always says tiktok stops working. It seems like every time there is a new update on tiktok app, It's been happening till I installed tiktok. You better fix this problem. I just give 3 stars."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This App is really glitchy I can't seem to stay on the App it keeps stopping and it's really annoying! Also this App should be renamed BEGTOK because every other post is a Scammer or a Homeless Beggar! Do better TikTok and don't ALLOW PANHANDLING ON THE APP! EVERYTIME I TRY TO GO INTO THE APP IT TAKES @LEAST 7X BEFORE I CAN STAY ON THE APP! DO BETTER TIKTOK
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,From all social media I love TikTok the best that's where I get my news from what happening all over the world also get ideas on cool trends to shop for. My family and I really enjoy and have fun making videos. The only thing that I do not like is it can glitch other than that is an awesome app
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's amazing you can record your 15 second clip on your phone with music or your own sound you can add text and theres filters its just like snap chat or Instagram but better in my opinion I would recommend to install it.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Was great until my account was hacked and taken over, but thankfully the customer support at TikTok was able to restore my account back to me the rightful owner!

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Was really good art launch but I'm pretty sure the developers abandoned the app. Won't load and must things are paid ads at this point. Goodbye to the last good social media. Now it's Twitter (or X) with ad videos.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"ok, listen. this app is great, i love it, great app for when your bored. its just that, i am on samsung galaxy s21, and there is no dark mode. whenever i am opening comments, or going to my profile, i literally get BLINDED by the light mode. please give samsung users dark mode.

Wish they lower the number of followers to go live lol but I'm loving it having a great time meetimg new ppl an motivation is everything

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Despise its inability to make dark mode for android. at this point it feels purposeful. Next up is just how often tiktok prompts you to get friends via your contacts.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,App has next to no moderation fraud and scam and impersonation accounts are everywhere and nothing happens. Anytime I report these accounts or say something about the total lack of moderation I get alpha brain ads. I always have alpha brain ads even though used the not interested button and even reported the product as a scam which it is.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I wish I could select certain people to see my like and follows and stuff like that instead of a group of people like all of my friends just a particular few friends and I would like to be able to search from the oldest when I go to someones channel Also when I repost something then I look at the same thing a couple days later it's gone
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app is good but from previous 4 days they're not responding or giving any kind of reply ...they prevented me from uploading videos without any reason...and didn't tell me any reason and also didn't tell me how to get rid of this ...why they're showing me community guidelines and temporarily prevented? This really hurt me and also my friends

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app and my favorite. Should really add dark mode to android phones instead of IOS, and should not make the camera worse on android because it takes away most of my quality and I know that's not my real quality of my camera. Still a good app but it has some flaws"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Adding ”Your friend shared this video with you. Watch it now!” to the copy link feature is really annoying as I wind up having to delete that text every time.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Good app generally, but the algorithm is ATROCIOUS. If I search something and scroll more than four times I manage to explore the deepest darkest corners of TikTok and I forget what I searched, meanwhile on my FYP, I have to press Not Interested 76 times in a row (this is not a massive exaggeration) and yet I still get the same damn videos of sports and girls getting their hair did. Where's the videos of Peter Griffin playing fortnite? Where's the people who talk about animals? Please fix."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Tik tok is are really good app if you want to be able to dance to tik Tok songs post pictures on your story and for videos I think that you should get tik Tok if there's something inappropriate on tik Tok you can submit it to the people who own tick tock and they will eventually get to it but if you do not submit it it might take longer for a tick tock to get to the video but tick tock will probably eventually get to the video and band it so if they haven't already bandit be patient theywillsoon
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It's a good app but doesn't let me upload anything from my gallery it only pulls up tiktok videos that I've saved and stupid memes that I don't want to post. I gave tiktok all the permissions it needed to access my gallery and it still does not let me make a video on this app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"They removed all sounds such as Ariana grande, Lumi Athena, and so on with the big artists. It's a music app and they're out here removing music. And the repost button? You can no longer put your opinion in the repost instead you have to put it in the comments. Its quality in my opinion has actually decreased by removing these two big features in the app."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Y'all have ruined my experience on this app. I initially gave a 5 star review but I'd give it less than 1 star if possible. My reach has been capped and reduced to getting stuck at around 150 to 200 no matter how good the content is. The same posts will get 1000s of views on insta and YouTube but will be stuck on 150 to 200 views on TikTok even after getting significant interactions (saves and likes). It no longer rewards creators but just randomly choses what to go ""viral"" and get views."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"1/25/23: This app actively suppresses Black content and or anything else they feel like, it barely ever works as advertised, & is almost always stealing user data in the background. 1/25/24: Here I am again to update anyone who reads this that not only are the above problems worse, but they are now censoring every single instance, and every account posting about the Palestinian Genocide. On top of that, they have removed essential accessibility features like autocaptions and translations."

May I have an explanation for this, and possibly have my problem solved?"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app has been having SO many problems lately and I've been a loyal user for two years. Firstly, the censorship has gotten out of control. I've had videos go down for ""community guidelines"" (no note on specific guidelines) when literally all I do is talk about makeup. The app encourages cyberbullying by removing posts and accounts solely based on mass reports. And finally, the app has been clunky and difficult to use with the newest updates."

They said publicly via major news media, "" If you use landscape and do content over a minute, they will push the video. This was a lie. It used to be a happy place, but the like ,follow,share, was working, until people realized that they can spam like and not watch the video"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Great app for killing time. I made up a plan where i'd post daily. i put effort in each one of my videos but NONE of them ended up on the fyp. The only 20 views i get are from my friends who have purposefully went on my acc to watch them. Keep in mind my i have 1300 followers & past videos gained about 500-1000 views each with little to no exceptions. I am tired of putting lots of work into my daily content for it to not get recommended on the fyp. I will be leaving the platform if this keeps on

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I cant post slideshows and I get random comments deleted just because they are in romanian and some of the words mean something offensive in english.

After scrolling through over a 100 videos, There was no videos related to science and technology. Additionally, the app keeps asking if I liked the video, even after clicking a dozen times ""no"" to similar videos, The same type of videos still pop up. Finally, when I click on preferred languages and translation language under settings and privacy, nothing happens."

When accessing the comment section if you mistakingly swipe down in the comment section the comments disappear. I have not found a way to fix this other than closing the app and reopening it.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Sometimes it's the best part of my day. Loving cooking video & the children/pets funny videos are my favorites. I hope it's our choice to continue this app. & not let others make my very few choices.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"In and of itself it's a great app for entertainment, but it's highly addictive too (and not in a good way). One might also add, the lack of dark mode on some devices (like my own phone, Redmi Note 11s) and other features are incredibly annoying and can make the experience so much worse. Been using TT for over 4 years now, I just wish for my phone to finally not blind me anymore."

This app absolutely listens to your conversations and knows where you are all the time.. After leaving this review my content on Tik Tok gets no views and the app is lagging.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app used to be really good, but now it's just trying to sell you things. Tiktok shop is inescapable and the lives are just cringe worthy ads. Every few videos is ""eligible for commission"" (an ad) and random companies/celebrities find their way onto your feed. Clicking ""Not Interested"" doesn't help any and Tiktok search is just a nightmare. There is no way for users to complain about or request features easily."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I like the app. However, something is fundamentally wrong with your data management. It eats up a lot of data, and that's just from editing a video. PLEASE, for the love of God, recode your app or whatever needs to be done to resolve this. I'm quite sure this is a problem with many others and not just myself. Having to delete the app's data in order to gain it back onto a phone is a major problem. Once again, recode the app from a foundation level before it becomes much worse.. cool app though."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"As a musician who posts explicit content, tick tock heavily sensors content, which is why I am giving this app a one star rating.

Besides that it's a great app one thing that doesn't work though is the ten minute videos, I can record them but not post them. I also wish we have the 3 minute video option back. Another thing that's weird is that when Im responding to my friends messages that were a while up it automatically shoots me back down please fix that, it's very annoying."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"good app i suppose, good for creating and watching. though there is an abundance of immature individuals and is over all an extremely hateful app if im being honest, this has nothing to do with the creators, it is a very well made app. it is around 50% of the user base is extremely inappropriate or rude, for example i have been told over 100+ death threats on one video alone. be aware, not a safe app for children either due to some of the content on there"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app and even though using it for awhile it is somewhat kinda hard doing a lot of things especially getting ahold of Customer support on a phone line. If you do have a phone line for support please let me know. Other than that I love this App 💯
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app functions well, but I do dislike the fact that most features are either exclusive, or get removed after a certain amount of time (for example, Dark Mode, Slideshows, Lives, Picture Replies, Video Replies, etc.), I also find the lack of free speech and truthfulness in content /comment posting, comments will be shadow removed without any notice or alert, saying the wrong thing will get your comment / video taken down, even if it's something light. These issues probably still wont be fixed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Everything about this is great but it would be nice for the ""not interested"" button to work better. When you click it it will only get stuff off the sound and creator. Not the type of vid it is. But overall is really great that is the only improvement. Most videos are great quality. If you are going to get this app make sure to watch what you comment. You can be a target of bullying very quickly and easily. When you wanna hate or comment negative thing wisely because it could mess you up."

I fall into the category of people who based their opinion of TikTok on an older version of the app, like... Maybe I saw it when it first came out and tried it but wasn't super into it. Fast forward to now, I'm starting up a business, and I have to say at least from that perspective I'm ecstatic! I 💕LOVE💕 the customizability, commerce options, etc.!"

That was so incredibly useful for me! And now it's gone with no warning whatsoever! I used it constantly on videos without creator made captions. Making the app much less accessible is ridiculous!

I suggest that you hit the download button."

It is very easy to creat and account and upload videos. For you"

The issue is that today I decided to update the app because I don't regularly update my apps and was like today is the day. After I updated it the app would not load or let me in at all. I have tried resetting my phone but nothing has changed. And there were some drafts that I had that I had planned on saving to my phone and now I have to delete the app which in turn deletes all of my drafts."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The app is really cool but I think a lot of people would like to have a mass unlike videos option. It's really hard to be deleting every manually. I'd appreciate this if my suggestion is taking into consideration.

For starters, tiktok banned me on EVERY SINGLE ONE of my accounts, im not sure what I had done because it hadnt given me a reason and i cant even appeal. Another reason is that I wasnt able to follow people at all. I would have to wait weeks until i could follow atleast one person and if tried to report it as a problem a number of times but tiktok told me that i was ""Breaking guidelines"". I never ONCE had broken any guideline."

It feels like what the internet was made to be. I understand the algorithm pushes more of what's interesting to me, yet, I am still able to search for other things and have them shared with me without it becoming the only thing I get or marginalized. it's not bogged down by multiple commercials and advertisements, which, in most apps, take away the enjoyment of the experience Abdul awal"

So I have to wait another 3 mins to actually get to the punchline that I didn't even hear in the first place. But u know I can hear it all over again it's fine 🙂 (sarcasm) PLEASE PUT A FAST FORWARD OPTION.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very nice But why it's that after updating this tiktok to the new version everything went bad and worst I will still give it five stars But tiktok lite is so much preferable more than the new version of normal tiktok

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The video editing features are the most frustrating I've ever encountered - so buggy, constantly changing/moving options, no real tutorial about how it works or when it changes.

Because I follow those that follow me and I unfollow the ones that stop following me. The problem I'm having is that it says that I'm following people who are not in my friends list and no matter how many times I scroll through the following section it never shows me anything other than the one I'm friends with.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have all in app notifications turned off and I'm still getting them every single time someone likes my comment. You go through the trouble of contacting support and providing screenshots and all they do it tell you to clear the cache, switch between wifi and mobile, or update the app. These solutions do absolutely nothing. Tons of other people have the same issue and have been for over a year. FIX YOUR APP."

The problem that I am having and I have written to you about already, is that I am unable to REPOST, yes I have reposts, only because I delete TikTok off of my device and install it back and it's there but as soon as I refresh my apps it's gone."

I'm old enough to use the app, I'm not posting inappropriate content(if at all), and I'm not commenting rude things under posts. I can only have a lasting private account, and I hate that. That private account makes it so I can't search, view what I liked, view comments, or view profiles. It's a little frustrating."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Editing tools are ruined since the latest update. When I come out of edit mode to upload or save to drafts, the captions are all over the place and not how I edited them (which takes me a long time on longer videos) and when I correct them, it happens again. I'll be willing to change my rating if TikTok fixes this. I'm going back to Capcut."

I made another account which also received warning on just the 3rd post, again simple information related to elected seats. Why they have made such platform in the first place if they can't allow flow of simple and completely harmless information. I would never get back to this platform again as it doesn't even know how to differentiate between harmful and harmless content. Totally pathetic forum 👎"

People can sell things, but the videos are just ads. While you already have paid ads. So you get about one video that's targeted towards you, a couple of uninteresting lives,more ads, a paid promotion video, and then a whole bunch of BS ads. It used to be such a great app, but greed does take over like it always does. Wouldn't mind now if the US tried to ban it again."

Buuuut, there is no actual video editing in the app. Works well with the ""Inshot"" app for video editing, though. (It's the ""easy"" button to cut/paste/create and share to TikTok and/or other socials!)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love it!! I can watch it for hours , and there's so many relatable, and funny videos to watch it really enjoy them!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I have been using this app for a long time. My only problem is that the adds that Sometimes show up once hou open the app But other then that this app is amazing. And my lil brother loves waiting the pet videos it is also educational for him So thank you very much
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,TikTok is most useful to me by letting me bookmark videos I find interesting/educational but after a while I find that some of the bookmarked videos become unavailable and I can't even remember which ones since there are so many. It would be a game changer to be able to batch download bookmarked content offline with a single click or if the app would let me reupload said content to my account to bypass the issue of the original poster removing it or making it private.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a wonderful app and a great way to get recognized for things that I can do. There is only one thing that I'm missing, however, and that would be the ""photos"" mode in the create tab. I have tried restarting my phone, deleting and reinstalling the app, clearing cache, but the ""photos"" tab just never appears. What do I do?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I haven't been able to use filter, unless I had them previously saved, in months. I have tried everything to fix this. Uninstalled and reinstalled. Followed every tutorial. Nothing fixes the issue. I'm not the only one w this issue! TikTok, fix this issue please before everyone gets sick of it and moves on to a new app. 😡"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The ads are getting insane. From regular ads, to TikTok shop, promoted videos, artist sponsorship and TikTok QVC lives it's not even fun anymore, it's just an ad scroller at this point."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Constantly getting served content I keep saying I don't want to see. Constant irrelevant live videos, topics and creators I've marked 'not interested' multiple times, ton of spam garbage and reports that get rejected. Way worse than it was six months or a year ago."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Too risky interface. Like whenever you open this app, you have to carefully navigate and make touches so you don't do anything by mistake. The annoying poppvers suggesting people to follow, the suggested accounts being shown suddenly while visiting someone's profile, being asked to turn on the profile view feature for 1000th time, it just makes the usee experience worst."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,My favorite app!! It has so many cool filters you can choose from and very unique videos!! Definitely will recommend it for teens bc smaller children will be influenced by wrong things!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love tik tok. But there's a problem. You see I have a Samsung Galaxy a15 and I always try to do 60 second tik toks. The problem is it never works. Even if I press 60 sec tik tok it will automatically be a 15 second tiktok. I updated it multiple times and it never did anything. I updated it today and only let me do one 60 second tik tok then it was automatically a 15 second tik tok. I ask if you can fix this. Hi I'm back. It let me do 60 second tiktoks but it won't let me do specific songs.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The TikTok algorithm used to be so good for the FYP now I can't even get any remotely relatable content. I hit not interested like 10-15 videos in a row and just end up closing the app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Horrible, they won't allow you contact them on the email provided in contact, phone number didn't work on 3 separate phones, and allow hate speech, false information, racism, and other illegal things on this and call it a kid friendly app. They allow people to say it's your fault when you open up about your sa experience. They also allow support of communism, pedophilia, and terrorism on this app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I do like the app overall but lately there are too many issues. The muting of videos and the strict FYP standards are making videos worthless to make
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I can't take it. So when I was younger I got TikTok, I made my account and everything and wasing liking it much so a deleted the app. But now, after 6 years, I decided to get it again because my friends use it a lot and want to send me things. But when I tried to long into my account it was suspended! I couldn't even re-use my email address or my user name that I use for EVERYTHING! I looked up how to unsuspend it but it said I had to file something before the 180 day mark after the suspension.."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I used to love this app! But after the new update It doesn't notify me on the following page when my friends are live. Please fix this!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've had this app since covid about 4 years. I've loved the connection I've felt to all types of people. Seeing things I've never seen. Hears peoples lives and ideas. Crying and laughing with them all. I'm going to miss my portal into a world beyond what my nation wants me to see. When the ban goes through I will also be Uninstalling any other social media or news. Thank you Mr Shou and all tiktok team members.

The features are engaging, and it's a great source of entertainment. Highly recommended for anyone looking to share their talents or discover new content!"""
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Good app to watch and pass time but really need to add more to the report system as a breif description of why repot is filed as harassment and stalking and fix it aswell getting reported for what ever reason that didnt happen then banned for a few days while others do it and not be banned for actually scaming is ridiculous
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It force closes for no reason then glitches and completely refuses to open. Then the phone tells me it's using too much memory. First time it did that, I un-installed and reinstalled and lost my account. Doesn't matter what I do, it's been impossible to recover it. I signed up on a new account and I can see my old one, I just can't access it yet it's there. It's not a phone memory issue because it's the only app that refuses to open. IDK."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"TERRIBLE they are not a platform for free speech at all, there is security issues on this app, and a bot that follows and tags you and my reports have been ignored. I would not spend any money on this app until security issues are sorted out and the limiting of people's posts. Needing 1000 followers to go Live, no other app has this. Find a better app. This one became awful 😖 awful customer service, and the app is like old FB."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ruined by updates. Fyp is completely irrelevant to my interest now. 'Not interested' function doesn't work at all - the same horrible channels keep coming back to back. Glitches a lot. More ads. Thumbnails no longer move as gifs. Tried clearing cache, internal to app & in phone. Uninstall/reinstall. Nothing works. Was enjoyable, now hopelessly boring. This seems to be a trend w/ other users."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have one problem. Why does it say ""sound has been removed for copyright restrictions"" when I use sound from TikTok library and I don't advertise. I thought sound got from the TikTok library is safe and free from risks."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm not able to make a slideshow. There's zero help for this issue and my app is updated. I uninstalled and reinstalled, no luck. Nothing works. 0/10"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Turned to rubbish now. It's just ads and promoted videos. I scroll 2 videos and get 3 ads in a row. Then a few promoters and another ad. We need a new less greedy platform without money hungry investors putting their dirty hands all over it.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,horrible!!! I upload videos with matching #s that fit. I get 1000s of views not a single like. I put so much effort into my videos? What the! I've had this app since 2018 I've never blown up once ... and I hate that you can't cancel uploading a video when I didn't mean to . I cry because of this app . Or maybe I'm dramatic but I'm quitting the app terrible 1 star.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Every time this thing updates I have to uninstall and reinstall it to watch the lives I follow and I'm sick of it. And it won't let me put my phone number on my profile because it says it's already in use, how TF is that even possible? I've put in an inquiry and get zero help to fix it"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the app overall, but I noticed my swipe feature is gone, but it keeps going and coming back again, and I just want it to stop going away or just to have it back. So van you do something abt thattik tok,thank you"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I love TikTok as a concept, but I'd be lying if I said the app is actually good. Between the broken feed, followed creators' videos never being pushed, and weaponized reporting, this app is hot garbage. Fix your product so I don't feel the need to use a cracked version of this thing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"لا اعرف ماذا اقول و لكن انه تطبيق رائع جدا يوجد به كل الانواع من الفديوهات الاغانى و القرآن و طبخ غيرها من الفيديوهات I don't know what to say, but this application is very wonderful and has all kinds of videos that you want, such as: songs, the Qur’an, cooking, and other videos. Thanks"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Past couple weeks can't see liked video's on people's pages I follow it throws up a black screen Everytime I switch pages or click on followers. It's been slow and not loading. This new update didn't make it any better now I can't even access my videos or pictures to make a TikTok it only gives me like 4 pictures from my gallery and can't save drafts
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app! I do give it a four because there are loads of disgusting stuff on there too, like girls showing off their private parts and its just not fun. Please ban them, it's not cool at all."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I mean, it's a pretty good social media platform, but there are some downsides. Tiktok allows content that shouldn't be allowed, such as only f@ns, s3xual activity, su!icid@l activity (self harm), animal abuse, and discrimination. Tiktok also allows bullying because I tried to stand up for someone, and they took my defensive comment down for no specific reason. So I highly don't recommend it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"TikTok downloads videos into the DCIM camera folder - the same folder that the default Camera app saves your own photos/videos in. It's an absurd choice by TikTok to store downloaded videos in your camera folder. And since I have Google Photos automatically back up all my Camera photos/videos, it ends up backing up TikTok videos as well. TikTok doesn't allow changing its default folder to save downloaded files."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is cool and informative, Yet it's a hassle to follow a story. Too much of a facade to everything, wish there was an a pp that was solid and kept it real when it comes to real life instances and true privacy for its users,,,but that will never happen as long as the stinking media is around.....things were just fine before the damn cell phone came about....that's when privacy went out the window!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"TikTok is a good app to find and / or create videos on, but there's a problem I'm struggling with. I'm a TikToker, and most times when I try to post a video that I record, the app allows me to post normally. Although, whenever I try to post a video with photos, before I can attempt to post it, it kicks me out and takes me back to the record screen. Pls fix this. <3"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Hello i find tiktok very good and so helpful but the new story updates bugs me out you can't comment anymore we want the old stories back!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app's good but I hate that it is unable to recognize the niche I'm interested in, after all that time liking self development and business it still doesn't recognize that or even asking if I'm interested with the feeds it brings me it just brings things I'm not interested in. Atleast watch what Instagram's doing"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is great! But there's something missing for android users, you see the settings I think? If you scroll down and I didn't see any dark mode added for android users. If you could can you please add dark mode for android users? Makes our eyes less blind- 😅"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Please add a feature to sort saved videos by date. It's incredibly annoying to have to scroll all the way to the bottom to find something.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's good and all but I can't send messages and videos to my freinds removing audios and I can't seem to update apart from that it's all good
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,No option to upload images as a slideshow on Pixel phone. Every time it just makes the images a video put together.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,As usual the best app ever I love it has no bug's so far and does not disappoint when it comes to challenges and trends it always keeps you updated on the latest trends
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"humongous filesize that only grows with each update. ""tiktok lite"" is not available in my region and seems like it never will be. i'm tired of my phone having almost no space left, so bye!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Too many bots selling headphones and push button fidget toys. You block them, and 2 videos later the exact same ""person/video"" but under a different name, pops up trying to sell you the item again. The algorithm should not only see what you like and show you what you like. But it should also see what you block, and block ALL instances of it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,There is no dark mode for android. I switched from iPhone to android recently due to my iPhone being hacked by a psycho ex and how easy it was for her to do that and I hate using tiktok because there is no dark mode and I can't reduce the brightness. Tiktok fix this
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,App has been mostly fine & all.. but lately when I view a live I can't comment or anything on said live stream. Obviously there's a bug & it kind of sucks
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app for a while now and with the latest update....Tf is with the spinning screen. Like it gives me headache and it's on almost everything with no way to turn it off. The app was ""fine"" well as fine as a declining app can be. They ban people for using legal substances but will allow cartel, war, and other horrid things with a simple color change to be shown to kids who just install the app. It's not bad when you get it to your personalization but the spinning... Why???"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Everything was normal few days ago but now my fyp is messed up and the only vids appearing from the country im in and my algorithm is not working It's supposed to show me vids I'm interested in or have watched the content before but all the vids rn is random grannies making pickle

Honestly just an annoying app and it's fun to watch videos on but I can't make any cause they're very laggy and it's Honestly annoying so I have to rate it 2 stars. Used to be a great app but the updates ruined it for me."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is not working well now..the most major problem is that it don't show favourite songs in favorite songs folder..... Please set it like the older"""
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You get the strangest strike violations from just commenting or going live with no actual indication of what you did wrong? I don't play music and I'm just streaming my phone screen (gaming). Aside from that, tik tok shop is a hit or miss. A bit more reliable than Wish, but not Temu as they offer actual customer service. The coupons are alright, but not worth the app hassle."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ad after Ad after Ad after Ad after Ad after AD! My entire fyp is just ads for the tik tok shop! I get you wanna promote some products but every single video being an AD? Ridiculous and the fact you removed THOUSANDS OF SOUNDS due to copyright is nuts, you guys used to be the best app now Id rather watch YouTube shorts than you and that says something. Please consider trying to improve the faults I listed"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Annoying notifications. Even after turning them off in the app and responding with the""not interested"" when I get them, they still show up. Worseover, although I DENIED permission to access my contacts, the app tried to recomend ""people I might know"" from my contacts. Clearly a blatant data theif app poorly disguised as content creation. If I could rate it zero stars I would."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There is 1GB of app data. MY DATA is being stored and worked on MY Phone instead of in the cloud where it belongs. This data is worked modified and compiled on my interests and interactions on the app. This profile and appdata, if cleared, erases my account, FYP, likes, and favorite lists. If I lose my phone, I lose my data. This is not normal"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I enjoy using tiktok a lot. Just really don't like that i get ad or sponsors over and over again. Especially when they have nothing to do with me or the same one repeatedly.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Once I couldn't send messages for a while because I wrote ""yes"" and it told me I was in violation of the guidelines I always see stolen videos and it's kinda annoying"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Its a good app but the problem here is that I'd open the app and wait for about 5 to 10 minutes before it show me anything and when it does it starts hanging 😔
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Unfortunately these apps drag you into a rabbit hole, first time use is interesting, but as soon as you use it for a couple of times somehow it narrows down your results to what it thinks you like!!! Other apps including google products , Instagram and many others use this kind of solution! for keeping you busy with limited results but in vast amount of contents. It's like they show you a shallow water in miles distance and tells you it's an ocean. This kind of approach is not acceptable."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It's a good app but there's a lot of adds every 3rd video seem to be a add and then every 10 videos is a scammer trying to sell you something or get you to click on a link in there bio. lately and thankfully it's still free but sometime in the future I can see them offering a payment plan per month to remove add and every app that does this always increase the add for the ones who don't want to pay so I can't recommend the app anymore because of the amount of adds and click bate
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is very convenient and i gave being using these app for about a year now. But whenever i install this app, The entire phone lags. Sometimes not but after some minute, it starts again. Btw i like the application very much."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why the hell are they adding ads for a tiktok?? That's insane. This is not YouTube, it's usually a 60 second post but even the 10 minute posts shouldn't have an popping out. I don't wanna wait those damn 5 seconds, keep it as something that pops up on our for you page (not in the middle of watching a damn tt) and allow us to scroll right past."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Great when it works and it doesn't always work. Lately it doesn't seem to save or update my liked videos, it's only been showing my likes as recent as a week ago and anything I've liked since then apparently just gets lost in the void. My liked video count is also wildly incorrect, showing 130 likes when I've had way, way more than that."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have given no permission to see my contacts or access to any of my social media accounts however it suggests friends that are on there. This is a clear breach of security and privacy and Google should take it off it play store!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I've enjoyed the app at first but it's logged me out of my account and won't let me back in. It's just been logging me into my other accounts. I've tried changing the password but it's changes the password to other accounts. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling but it's didn't work either. They also remove all the best features a lot. Otherwise the app is good.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"All I see is TikTok Shop on my feed. Not sure if this is my personal feed or what. But I received a gift saying if I buy 3 items I will get 3 coupons worth $100, total. I purchase 3 items and my coupons are for certain amounts off a certain amount. Luckily, I was able to cancel my order in time. Some poor person is going to fall for this and not catch it in time because tiktok fails to properly inform of all details before the purchase is made. Do better, TikTok!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Feed doen't refresh. I don't get content in my preferred language. Support doesn't react to my inquiries. No videos that match my interests are shown in my for you page. Content with words I filtered are still showing on my for you page
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I use this app almost everyday and I enjoy these short videos but for some reason, it is stuck on one filter and never lets me go off of it. I am always doing private videos as I don't want to post for public. I have no idea why it is stuck on one filter and the option to change filters is not working at all. Please can you fix that. It would mean the world to me! If this wasn't a problem, this would've been a 4 star review. P.S If you would stop letting fake creators post, I would appreciate."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I get the last update , when I recieve a notification, I opne the app it's give me there is no intrenet connection and I could not see it in the app, the app didn not work , I'm trying to ues the website it works."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Pros: Easy to use, loads of sounds, lives can be fun and entertaining, edit software is pretty good, and tons of content. Cons: 200 view jail ( if youre a new creator youll be stuck here for awhile. Promote is the only way out.) , not enough customization for profile, bugs (profile pic not showing, analytics saying you haven't posted in days when you post daily) Reporting a problem, & they never get back to you, and app crashing. I'll update if they fix the issues."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Most of my videos get muted due to ""copyright infringements"" even though I pick the sounds from their app. Its quite pathetic for these developers & for the music industry. Ontop of the Army bots bots that annoy me through messages & comments. I'd go deep into the negative stars if I could."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My phone has non stop glitching with this app and it's quite frankly frustrating coming from a content creators viewpoint. Audio becomes frazzled. The video editor NEVER stops becoming laggy. It's intensely hard to work with. And photo mode seems exclusive only to certain types of phone and software. I'll retract my review once these are fixed however. It is frustrating and now prevents me from using the app all together as I can't even upload decent content without something glitching...
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,More than likely you're going to experience this at 1 time or another but essentially. I think it's I'm a Monopoly and the only people that are getting views and likes and comments are. The ones that are purchasing the sponsored applications not to mention the random crashes and the extreme intrusion of privacy. If you look at this apps details it'll tell you exactly where all it has access to and it's concerning.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I can't log in on my TV. It's a shame a big platform won't do better. Monkeys could have done a better job perfecting this app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"ok, if used as a promotion method. the aggressive reminders to turn on all kinds of things to keep you busy are a real usability problem. furthermore, the music copyright checks are very poorly executed. I often have my own music, which I created and registered myself, claimed by some copyright ghost and there isn't a way to dispute a claim. Tiktok ia always right and untouchable. as a creator this is unacceptable and I will always prefer other platforms. can't recommend it much..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I try to block videos by sound, I keep getting the same ones over and over again. I must have blocked hundreds of accounts with ""you've been selected as the winner"" as their title, but get a new one commenting on one of my posts every single day. Why? It's ridiculous."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Your videos are only ""pushed"" if you pay to promote. If you don't pay, they die out VERY quickly. I've done several experimental videos and it's a fact, not an opinion. Money grab."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great for viewing other videos...like a fast YouTube! Ok for uploading own video...editing is good but could be better as it can ruin your edit IF you change the audio track...takes it all straight back to a beat synced video...which is not what you want when you e taken the time to edit your own!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why is there not an option to enable dark mode on Android devices yet? Seriously, this is ridiculous. It is frustrating to view the white interface so frequently."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Uses definitely too much battery in background. ""Watch and follow"" isn't enough frequently used shortcut for popping up every single time."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Gives good recommendations for videos and is one of the best new top apps out there. Is like YouTube except shorter videos. Only recommendationI have for the app is for them to get rid of the Shopping tab they just added to the main screen and reverse it back to being only who you follow and your feed. The ads that they have for products and New movies are good enough for advertisement and trying to get people to buy products.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I uninstalled and reinstalled the app as a last hoorah because it was buggy, not letting me upload my videos, my fyp was repeating videos over and over, refreshing at random, I switched accounts and it was the same. Now I can't log back in at all. The puzzle slider keeps refreshing new puzzles without letting my log in info get verified. I am locked out and can no longer interact with clients who have discovered my work on this platform"

The other videos are repost from people you have no connection to and don't know and there's no way to turn it off. If the videos not a strangers repost then it's a video you've already seen, sometimes a video you've even already liked. What is going on with tiktok lately!"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my concern regarding the limited payment options available on the TikTok app. As a user, I believe it is crucial to have access to a variety of payment methods, including bank transfers and card payments.Not everyone has access to Google Pay, and restricting payment options to this platform excludes a significant number of potential users. By expanding the payment options to include bank transfers and card payment. PLS HELP 🙏"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app but there is just to many advertisement, every 10-5 videos you hit with a temu ad or every 3 videos you get a TikTok shop item video which is just people dropping things and selling them for tons of money definitely not one of the worst apps but it's also not that great with all the new updates. What also sucks more is the update to the creator fund which for every 1000 views you get 1-2 CENTS without tax. Now the videos need to be over 1 minute long to be eligible. DO BETTER"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There needs to be a drop down of who I follow to watch a specific video. I learn new things and don't like trying to find who I follow to learn what I want. Very disorganized, and not e erode user friendly. This is what is wrong with social media, all based on the I need it now of instant gratification with no content. Need more you tube likeness, and Facebook videos. Also I would love to be able to write a comment and bot be hindered in how many characters I get to use."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app isn't bad but, I don't know if I don't have the premium version or something, but I can't make slideshows... This is starting to get really annoying and and I feel like I shouldn't be limited on sharing my content ideas... I've tried updating and clearing cache/data and it still doesn't work... Tik Tok, please fix this."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I use to love this app, I met some awesome people on here but now tiktok deletes my videos and alot have been muted do to copyright issues. It's crazy how this happens. When people creates these kinds of apps, they should think of their audience, the people who are making videos, tiktok should want us to be happy but they don't. We work hard in making our videos then they mute and delete. I'm very disappointed... I won't be using this app until the issues get worked out."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Certainly! TikTok is a popular social media platform known for its short-form videos. It offers a diverse range of content, from creative dances to informative clips. The app's algorithm effectively curates a personalized feed, keeping users engaged. However, concerns about data privacy and the potential for inappropriate content are worth considering. Overall, TikTok provides a unique and entertaining user experience, but users should be mindful of privacy settings and content moderation."

Pretty sad and frustrated - if anyone has an idea please get in touch. Thanks

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I no longer have the auto-captions as an option for any video. Descriptions for other langues also don't have the option for translation. This only happened today.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I don't have slideshow mode and that makes me pretty mad becuase I can't do trends and other videos like that so until it gets fixed 3 stars

I can't even explain it right and when I press the back button from profiles it shows like 3 different screens being pushed away, really weird. It's making me want to delete the app because of this issue."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I think it's perfect app to use when bored or to just make videos and if you don't want people to save the video you can put that option
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The only bad thing is the privacy policy, there is no way to decline it and have less unrelevant ads, and the ads that you give is annoying, o hope you will make a decline button."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Used to love this app, but it's oversaturated with ads now. Keeps telling me to post photos or Shop stuff. Stop trying to be Amazon or IG. They also removed the option to tag other accounts in videos which is how a lot of creators credit people. Terrible decision, but not their first. I'm over it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I reported one video because they gave a child alcohol (its illegal), and now it won't let me watch any videos containing anything to do with alcohol not even the word. I didn't report it because of the alcohol l, I reported it because giving anyone alcohol under 21 is illegal. Now, since I updated it, it's lagging worse than without the update. Tiktok has really gone downhill."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app constantly turns down my media volume by about 3 clicks when I'm not using it. Unacceptable! On top of that, my ""for you"" page ends after about 15 videos, and I have to constantly restart the app to refresh the for you page. It claims I've got no internet connection yet sits there and plays the live video I get stuck on."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Too many scammers. Also, latest update has returned the icons over the screen when you zoom and let go so you cannot see the whole screen/text"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This would've been a 5 star rating if tiktok hadn't updated last night. I cannot look at slideshows, it just shows the image on the first slide as black and I cannot scroll to the next images. I also cannot repost any videos at all.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"These platform is a joke. My account got banned because I used to post video or things from even the news that doesn't support the left agenda. They had been doing this for a while. Many times I had been appealing banned videos and yes, they put them back and even apologize for having them out, but only after a lot of messeges back and forward. Now, when I tried to challenge their unfair decision...I can't, a ""problems with network"" messege comes up."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I don't know what happened with the last update but when I search something up and watch a few videos it changes to videos I'm not interested in. Really upset that I can't get inspo since it changes, but when I click off and go back in it fixes it for another few videos then changes again. Most of the time it's really sexual content and again I'm not interested."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have had tiktok since it came out,and i never gad any issues with if until recently. I don't know why, but it would essentially stop working all together. Delayed sound,video, and just overall poor performance.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The alerts and lack of privacy settings for people who can follow me is annoying but overall a really good form of entertainment and source of unverified information. Take it at face value. Some information is far ahead of the verified sources and in its raw form so it can be dangerous to spread misinformation, and very useful to spread the reality of things"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It was letting me save videos but now it won't at all and I've tried everything but after the update or something it stopped letting me save anything crashing when almost saved and saying ""tap to try again"" than doesn't do anything had this issue before and it was fixed but now it's back it only seems to happen to Android nothing is fixing it (the settings are on for the videos to be saved but it won't complete a save)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,In the past couple days 99% of my For You page is static images or slideshows. I tried resetting my for you page and it worked for a 5 minutes and then went back to exclusively showing me photos. This might break my TikTok addiction because I'm less and less inclined to open it knowing that I have the chore of swiping between 10 and 15 photo posts to maybe get a video I'm interested in.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Amount of dangerous videos and hacking on online gaming. I've reported multiple times about this issue, but tiktok just sweeps it under the carpet as usual. You don't deserve 1 star"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The AI they use to decide if a message violates their terms of service or not is a buggy and needs to be fixed, because when I type the sentence ""I love you"" to My mother it gets flagged as inappropriate. but I have received messages telling me to harm myself and when I report them I'm told that there's nothing wrong with those messages. This is ridiculous. The moderator team also needs to get off their behinds and start to take down these clearly sexual pages."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I logged back in froma 6 months break from Tiktok. And. It's just gotten exponentially worse. There's now a shopping section. Ick. But the algorithm is still horrendous. I down vote every video instantly. And you can still only block 100 tags. How stupid. Most egregious of all I can't escape vomit inducing medical videos. For the same reason the app sucks. If you click on a person's page to block them. It thinks you've interacted with them and shows you more and more and more.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So many bots on this app that follow, like or even reply on posts and comments. Not to mention, a huge time waste. And no dark mode."

But after I posted a blurry clip of cyclists and used the word ""naked"" they froze all my vids + :1acct for review. Soon their⁴ notifications changed to something like ""We apologize we have reviewed your videos and will restore your data shortly"". But my vids never were restored. After 10 requests over a year, no response. Just gone, I'm still bummed."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I just got the new update, and I'd love to know: what's with the transitions between each tab? It's very unnecessary, like when I exit out of the add tab, the screen spins and then goes away? Sheesh. Also, I don't appreciate the shop section being placed between my 'for you' page and friends page. The shop has never caught my eye before, and it probably never will."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The only issue I have with the app is how you can accidently send videos. You could be scrolling on the app and you go to swip to go to the next video there's a feacher where if you press and hold for a slight secound you can send the video to either your friends or followers but it's a pain because there's already a share button near the like and follow buttons.

Please do something about an update when the coding is not so heavy and the app is not becoming another social media platform where people constantly try to sell you products when all people are trying to do is have an online social interaction with others. So frustrating!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I don't know why a person can't have a app long before it crashes. very disappointed in tik tok app. for a app that's doing so well with lots of people on this platform. for it to just stop working just like that . yes same complaint as the others. I can't open the app. it kicks me out. I've been on this app for years now and just gone. wasted my time for what. huh? my mobile tells me the app has a bug. fix that bug or you will lose many people because of this.

I tried to appeal it, but the response was that the time frame for appeal had expired. While others roam the app in bathing suits and barely nothing on. So i deleted the app and will never download it again because of the favoritism that they display!!!."

I have about 300, and it would just be easier if I could search it by name instead of scrolling for ever, as well as an ability to select multiple to delete at once instead of scrolling and deleting one, and then being sent back to the top so I have to scroll down there again.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"A recent bug is that a lot of time I will tap on the app on my home screen and it just refuses to open, it will make the animation that its opening but then only flash a white screen and immediately close. this does not happen with my other apps. Sometimes I have to restart my phone just to get it to open once. Other than that on my android phone making tiktoks is completely impossible and the app kept crashing so I just gave up and only watch. Otherwise, I do enjoy the app."

I'm almost completely convinced to delete the app, however the videos are fun to watch and please my brain. Please fix the crashes so TikTok can return to the fun app it used to be."

From block accounts that you don't want to see and still they appear to don't show me this or this creator just to get the same sound and or creator 20 videos all of this after clicking on do show me this or blocking the account and closing out the app. Kinda pointless to complain but it sure ruins the app."

Sometimes, I'm too focused on the app rather than my surroundings. But this app can also be useful. I've learned some new things. Maybe some things that could help my everyday life. I gave tik tok a 4 star rating because it can be like i already said very addictive."

Everytime i have enough data it does not open at all... I just don't know how to explain this...

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Excellent app, but I will give you guys a 4 star rating. An upgrade is needed. A Voice note feature. Add this feature to TikTok in the message section and my rate will turn into a 5 star."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I would like to know why apps like TikTok constantly give updates that nobody wanted and either make it more difficult to use the app in the way that the majority of users prefer (removing the ability to ""hide"" in the comments if a video makes you uncomfortable or you would rather just listen instead of watch) or is completely worthless and solves no problems. Additionally, if I have auto update turned off, there should be NO reason why MY app on MY DEVICE changes without my express permission."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I would give this full stars if TikTok had the option to actually make slideshows. For users like myself, they never show up at all. I would definitely make more content if the website actually allowed everyone to make slideshows. Edit: I also cannot regularly type in emojis and can only do so by copy and pasting. This is very annoying and leavese to move it down one star. I should be able to use these features normally, it's a SOCIAL MEDIA. I'm very close to just moving on from here."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is addictive, mesmerising, eye opening, manipulative, it shows you whatever you search for, and it lacks realism. You can take this in whichever way you want; good or bad. But I wouldn't recommend it for your children. They might say, ""But all my friends have it!"" Or ""It's not dangerous!"" But really, it is as it's powerful in the art of deception. Tiktok may not cause physical harm, but it can ingrave irreparable damage to someone's mind in the way of diminishing self-esteem and more."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I like this app but you have to follow someone who locks there content. how are you to know if they have anything in common if you can't see there profile.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Terrible app design, pop ups, auto play, overwhelming. Also seems to use a lot of system resources/battery. But, once you get past all that, the user content is pretty good."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love it, but I have this problem where my photo swipe option keeps disappearing a lot. I've contacted tiktok through the 'report a problem' section a few times about this, and they now won't answer me. Alot of other people have with this problem and tiktok had replied to someone that it is a 'select user' thing, meaning apparently only some users have the option. However this is not true, my sister can log into my account and post a photo swipe video, and I still can't on my device. Please fix."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"TikTok needs to fix their algorithm. It's so stupid. Someone sends me a link to a TikTok video, which Im willing to open and watch in the app... instead of showing me the video that I actually clicked on to see... they try to show me 5 different videos that aren't the video I literally clicked on to watch. Maybe show people the videos they tell you they want to watch instead of not showing them those videos and trying to force them to watch random videos? Are you guys stupid? Uninstalled."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really like the concept of tiktok, I like watching funny videos and even learning stuff. There has been a few gliching issues with the app, it constantly logs me out. Other than that I don't really have any other issues"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Absolute garbage, and not worth the time. I spent the time confirming my email, and setting up a general profile. It wouldn't let me fully update my profile, saying ""i was doing that too much"". 4 days later, I was permanently banned, except I haven't done anything with anyone or interacted, and only had one friend! Don't waste your time."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I updated the app and it won't even open anymore. I don't want to delete and re-download it since I would lose all of my drafts + that probably wouldn't even help since it would just download it with the newest version again.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Creating a TikTok song and video was an exhilarating experience that seamlessly blended music, creativity, and the vibrant TikTok community. The process began with selecting the perfect song – a catchy, trending track that resonated with the platform's diverse audience. As the beat set the rhythm, the challenge was to choreograph engaging dance moves or craft compelling visuals that would captivate viewers. The song's lyrics became the narrative foundation, guiding the creation of a storyline ."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I rate TikTok 4 out of five stars. The reason I rate TikTok 4 out of 5 stars is because sometimes your account will get permanently banned for unreasonable reasons and when you try it to get the account back, you won't get notified right away. They try to notify you as fast as they can but for me I've never got notified back. But the bright side is you can support businesses by doing ads. You can choose different languages so that you can understand what's going on and it looks good."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been having problems with tiktok for a while but nothing too serious. However, today I was scrolling on tiktok and it informed me I have logged out of my account (I haven't). I closed the app and opened it again and it closed my account. I tried logging in again and it said my account had been blocked because I have ""violated the community rules"" when literally the only thing I do on tiktok is post videos with random filters or watch reddit stories. I'm really disappointed with this app"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"An absolute disaster for privacy and security. There's no logical reason that if I ask this app not to get my location, or my contacts, or my social media info that it should still be able to recommend people I only talk to IRL and suggest videos and accounts that related to my specific state and city. I've never given this app any permissions and it's recommending family members to me that live on the other side of the country. This app is so egregious it really is borderline criminal."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The search function is completely broken. Whenever I search a topic all the thumbnails displayed are related but when I click one and try to scroll, I'm shown completely unrelated videos after about two-three scrolls. This is making the search function basically completely unusable and I've seen many other users complaining about it too."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok content is great. Tiktok navigation is HORRIBLE. Why dosn't pushing the baxk button go back to the previous vid like EVERY OTHER APP?!? Why is watch history buried 4 levels in menus? Why can I not shut off like notifications? Why so many buttons and only select all or none? Would definitely be 5 stars for content, but negative one star for navigation!!!"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"TikTok shop ruined everything. Too many people trying to sell something instead of making actual content. Also, I can tap 'not interested' a hundred times and still see content I don't want. How's that an algorithm if it does not learn?! Now there's a shop tab which I find offensive. I think it's time to move away from this mess."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's always updating things that make it hard to find your favorite things or specific ideas you want to add to your content. Also I've made 100% original content within the app (no external tools) and I got flagged for unoriginal content.. they flag every video that may appose them. And if you ask for support they just never answer or give generic response that won't help. Everything is automated so good luck.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The block button is getting a workout recently with all the user accounts that have been putting out ads. I swear it like every 3 vids.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It sucks here, but it's still better than Facebook or Instagram. Tiktok is horrible at dealing with racism, giving out random senseless community guidelines violations, and ignoring in app issues while crashing.

God, please change this TikTok. Also, to be clear, I have never made a low quality and unoriginal video unless I'm hopping on the train of trends. So TikTok, maybe consider making this less harsh?

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"My complaint is they remove music from your videos claiming copywriting. If that was the real issue then why offer certain music in the first place?? My other complaint is you can't say certain things to your friends through messages cause it violates their guidelines, but yet you got people making videos saying derogatory words and sexual suggestive content and don't bother them. Also I made a TikTok playing one of their games and TikTok took it down saying it violated their guidelines."

Basic functionality is missing, and the app has safeguards to its own UI elements that prevents force-dark developer options from working.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Entirely too complicated. No way to edit a caption after you post the video. No way to add a link to your profile. Going through setting is like going through a maze. Smh who in the hell designs this ?

Nevertheless, here they are: Need simple way to mirror video so when people show a book to the camera, The text isn't backward. How do I know which posts are the most recent, so I can watch them in order? How do I teach the algorithm which types of videos I don't want to watch? I assume that when I follow, like, or comment, the algorithm takes that into account. When I don't like a video am I supposed to give it a thumbs down?"

However, I have noticed some of my favorite creators being affected by inexplicable censorship.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Make the heart button for comments bigger and i will put my rating back up. I keep accedentally hitting not interested cus it registers a hold when tapping and then hits uninterested. There should be a confirmation popup for that!!!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Horrible updates, after the update it literally removed my pfp and kept on saying my connection is bad and to try again when my WiFi is amazing. If i could i would give 0 stars. Every update ruins the app more and more, bring back repost commenting and I'll change the review!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Tik Tok is a cool app. It's like Facebook with a lot more Fake profiles trying to suck some money out of unsuspecting idiots.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app is continuously losing features in an attempt to lock the user in. Sad to see that they're taking the same route as Google.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I find myself using TikTok less and less. The app is filled with lies, misinformation and obvious attempts to show false news stories as real There is a fair amount of hate speech, bullying and people attacking others for various reasons. TikTok does absolutely nothing to combat any of the above. If you download the app just know 99.9% of what you will see is a lie. Tiktok needs to do a better job."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've noticed that if you filter out a word (ex ASMR), you will literally get quadruple of the topic you do not want to see on your FYP. You can report, but they never respond. It's just become an app people advertise & sell products on. Plus, there are way too many fake accounts and those that keep tagging you w/ ""you have been selected as the winner."" Tik tok will not allow you to report"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I can't comment on videos and the videos are not interesting I don't know why you can't comment on a app that people post vids on this is becoming YouTube shorts I even made a account what's older to see if it would let me comment and it didn't the worst part is I kept seeing the same videos on my home page I made 2 accounts still couldn't comment and the videos were the same

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Im gonna go ahead and say it. I would never downloaded Tiktok. The Chinese based company has ties with the Chinese government. In the Chinese law, the Chinese government can simply demand access to the data saved on Tiktok. So the Chinese government can access your device. That's an obvious problem, depriving at least a billion civilians without electronic access, which is terrible as it could be a foothold in other critical electronic (internet) based everyday services. Tiktok is very dangerous"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"1 star: 1: Not interested still makes you see more of the same topic 2. TikTok algorithm is now banning you for saying anything slightly negative ( like something is ""not smart"") 3. Following someone makes you never see that creators post again 4. ads 5. soft ban 6. etc. It almost seems like the US took over the TikToks database and destroyed the platform."

I think you should make a privacy policy for copy right system .. this way the original content creators will feel less insecure plz do think about it.

Only for the product to be more and the fact no mention of having to paying shipping till you read. I can get the same product on Amazon for what it equals to get your product on TikTok. Most of what pops up now is Tiktok Ads for their products. Tiktok used to give me good kdrama or series to want to watch now. Useless things pop up."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"From a content creator stand point, they don't want you to make content. From a viewer standpoint, they do t want you to follow people, bc they make you auto unfollow random creators. Other than that, 10/10"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I like app. Everything is good. Maybe to mutch updates. Need only one thing back is when you repost you can comment on your repost. The important thing that is removed from tiktok 😮‍💨

Nowadays, I only see the people I follow on the following tab. My fyp is filled with fake accounts and temu scams. A decent chunk of creators have quit due to nonsensical bans. Others are overwhelmed managing multiple accounts as backups. To make up for lost revenue, they added this Amazon knock-off. They need to stop brown-nosing the puritanical idiots and make this 18+."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have 2 major issues with the app. 1. Every other video is an ad for something on the tiktok shop. 2. The censorship is insane, trying to spread awareness about human rights issues gets blocked from the fyp, labeled as ""unoriginal content."""

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's fine, but everyone's experiences differ differently. Myself, I understand that tiktok is a Chinese based company with misleading algorithms that penalize anyone on the first violation and deducts them on a points system without pause. Tiktok should have a community standard guideline or SOP read and signed while signing up and starting a profile; instead of punishing you on being yourself. So now we use the same dialogue and context in code to vacate these rediculous censorship guidelines."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Spent over half an hour editing a video only to have it messed up when posted. Also lost a draft for reason thanks for that

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Some of these filters call people dumb, which I just had happened to me and some of its content creators practice harmful content.

Either the algorithm is broken or the people behind it are clueless on how to enforce their own guidelines. I must say I enjoy other people's content, but I do feel discriminated against.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app lets a video maker, Drew Tyson Afualo, spread 'sexist and hateful rhetoric' and make money off of it. That's not cool since I think Tik Tok does try to 'moderate' against that sort of stuff. Oh and also the CCP has 'influence' over it which is really 'dangerous.' Have a nice day, and it's probably at least a good idea to 'be careful' using this app! Think if you want! :-)"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app is fun but the algorithm tends to favor white rich people and tends to delete videos and accounts for calling Tiktok and creaters out for terrible behavior.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,At 1st I was unsure about this app (downloaded Aug. 2020).. that all changed. I like to make ppl laugh thru skits & thru music (I do serious & funny raps). Only reason it ain't 5 stars is bc I lost my 1st account at nearly 10k bc of mass reporting. Plz fix that issue bc too many good creators lose accounts over this. @hutch.the.og check me out sometime 🤪
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a fun app, however the downside is the massive amount of space requirements more than one GB, makes no sense."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's a good app but can you give us the options over to fix anything without deleting the video like to edit video
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I recommend clapper instead: no ads & less censorship there. This app is really just an ad delivery platform now and it's censoring people who try to use any constitutionally guaranteed right. Avoid this app.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Tik tok is out of control. They block half your messages (all of which harmless) limiting your free speech. They are stupid enough to think AI is intuitive enough to effectively monitor speech. They give strikes to so many harmless videos. Why isn't tik tok getting strikes for its incompetence? Every time i gain a subscriber my subscriber count goes down. Explain how that works? Really hope someone can make an alternative. Tik Tok does not deserve this much access to the public square.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The last few updates have been broken on my Fold5. Randomly videos take up only the left half of the inner screen.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The amount of bugs in this app is stupid. They make so much money and don't seem to be butting it into making a complete app. Not a day day goes by where I have multiple bugs.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's good, very addicting, but recently my account has lost the ability to send videos to my friends via Tiktok, and I can no longer view my friends videos from the homepage. No explanation from tiktok. Not sure if anyone else has these problems, but it's just inconvenient."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Nice application, but some live hosts are very abusive and don't know how to report for their abusive behavior. My favorite songs disappeared by itself. I dknow why"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,My tiktok shop won't let me post. Lately my app has been getting stuck when I get to a live page. The tiktok shop don't tell you that you need batteries.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love TikTok and all but it would be nice if I could have the same accessibility as people wit iPhones on android. for an example, being able to make slideshows or have TikTok shop l"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"TikTok is a helpful platform to get my content out there, obtain viewership, and hopefully HELP other people experiencing similar struggles to my own! However, my issue with the APP is that it often lags worse than any other app I have, lags the rest of my device, and takes up an extraordinary amount of space."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After last update , tiktok is not working , when I open any I'D, tiktok show us previous I'd name on the header... And not be able to search any other account or video..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"With every update, the app refuses to open. I have to delete and re-download it every single time, it's getting really annoying. Although I have to mention, sometimes it happens without any updates? It's not like any other app on my phone does that either - it happens only to tiktok."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"At the time , this app was a pleasure to be on . Until recently, I was permanently banded for no reason without any explanations."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This App is totally amazing. You you want to make good friends and if you are interested in making great videos you have come to the right place I'm telling you!!! phenomenal 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This is the worst app I've ever seen I don't upload any videos I haven't done anything but it's 2nd time TikTok team have ban my account I can't send or receive messages 😭😭😭 ive send report messages but nothing happen 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely LOVE!!! I am very late and new to TicToc 🤦‍♀️ (being the boomer that I am) 🤣🤣 .. and can't believe it took me THIS long to come aboard 🤷‍♀️. . I am in the infancy stages of my Youtube channel and branched out, looking to expand my ""follower base"" and was DEFINITELY pleasantly surprised. 🥰 Thank you so very much!!! Sincerely, Your Newest Fan 💋"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They dont take care of ""you're a winner accounts."" Also, everyone is selling something so it's like one big commercial. I think there is a limit to how manyy people you can block."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Two stars because every good audio has been removed and my edits r destroyed. Fix this or I might delete the app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing,the filters awesome. I feel like it's good therapy but can sometimes be very addictive. So if you're thinking of downloading it for your kid,who's about 10 years limit their screen time on it. Other then that it's very entertaining, so try it for the best experience"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I like this app and use it every day it's nice to scroll through and just watch a bunch of different things the ads aren't a big of a deal since u can just scroll pass them anyways it's good but my problem is that the repost button keeps dissapearing and features on my videos like to view likes and to see who's viewed my videos but my main problem is the repost button because it just comes for a few hours and goes again it's quite annoying and makes me wanna throw my phone across the room.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app has become terrible since I updated it recently. I know the email address and password used for my account are both correct but according to you idiots, it's STILL incorrect. Haven't used it for a few months now but still have it installed and logged in. Why can't I log back in even though i never logged out? Don't palm me off with excuses like u do 2 others that are having other issues with the app. Started out good but it's mow getting stupid. Your admin team don't care."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app now shares tiktok videos I have sent to friends in facebook messenger or posted to my Facebook timeline in tiktok d.m. with the same people. It has been happening with Instagram shares, too. I've never synced contacts between the apps and have the feature turned off, but it still happens, and it's annoying!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The problem with this app is that it is so addictive, accessible, creative, influential and time consuming that you'll have to force yourself not to use it. I absolutely love having this app on my phone because I even though people may not agree with my points and views, I get to be me. A creative force recognized by a creative few. Never started this to change your mind just to challenge it! Thank you Tic Tok nation 🙏."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pretty entertaining pretty all right, I've been using this app for a couple of years now, there's just only a few issues that wouldn't be so hard to fix. It would be much appreciated if the word count in comments sections would expand, it feels very limited and I think it would be really cool if we just had a little bit more freedom when speaking instead of just replying to our own comments. Secondly, when it comes to certain words, it immediately deleted my comment, all I said was ew."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,So far so good! but the logging in and passwords as well as trying to change details is difficult to navigate. Does not integrate smoothly with capcut. Does not recognise the same account therefore it doesn't sync well between the two.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok you have given me the worst experience ever. Every time I search for something the whole app stops functioning, my phone freezes. I cannot watch more than one video or content through search in peace!😡😡😡😡 It's annoying and very irritating. It's the worst experience ever! I'm no longer interested in the app because of this BS!🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️😏😏😏"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Some people have the discover tab and others have the friends tab. There is no way to change it and I don't ever use the friends tab but I'm stuck with it. Bring back the discover tab or give users the option between which one they want it makes no sense to randomize who gets what.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"While I thoroughly enjoy TikTok more than YouTube, I wish the ""Not interested"" buttons functioned properly. I shouldn't have to keep hearing the same annoying songs I hate that start trending appear every few swipes (or even back-to-back), same with filters I don't like that are potentially creepy and/or problematic."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Was good and really enjoyed it but the new feature of the screen spinning like a transition has made it un usable anytime you go back a tab or hit the back arrow it spins like a slide show transition anytime I see it I'm instantly nauseous lightheaded and have a migraine it would be fine if there was a way to disable it but there isn't.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Recent updates don't allow ANY notifications to push thru. It used to work fine, until a few months ago. I wish the developers would correct this issue. I have all my settings turned on. I've restarted my phone MULTIPLE times..I've also uninstalled, AND reinstalled MULTIPLE times, nothing works."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Idk what tiktok did but since the last update but my account is messed up. I can't read my messages and the activity status toggle and icon have vanished completely. It's very glitchy. I have sent them several messages concerning this and no fix in sight. Gonna signout and Uninstall until they fix this and or further notice.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I give it 1 because as I have an Android some things don't work for me. And after watching for a couple minutes it starts to freeze and when I download it now it goes back to the old TikTok not the new one (Edit) I still give it a one because it keep that my password is incorrect when it's not and ive been logging into this stuff for two years and this the first time it hss happened. If you fix it, ill put it on four."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Finally decided to use tiktok but for some reason I'm always having trouble with sending videos or even messages. It keeps saying ""this message may be in violation of our community guidelines..."" for LITERALLY everything g I try sending. I've Uninstalled the app several times and logging back in and seems to keep doing the same thing"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I have had this app since 2022 and I've never had this issue with it until now. For longer videos (1+ mins) the video has started going at a slower pace but the audio is still playing at the same speed. I haven't changed the playback speed so idk why this is happening either
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is an absolute time killer! I love spending time flicking through multiple videos to find a good one. There is so much variety on the app that there is a video for everyone! There is a feature that allows you to like videos and watch them again later, this is extremely useful for crafts or cooking videos.l also really enjoy uploading videos to my channel and shearing my content with others who have the same interest. It is very easy to creat and account and upload videos. For you"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app can kind of be a real waste of time. I am not too sure about everyone else, but every time I upload a video it gets 0 views every time! I have searched up so many ways to fix the problem but it just never works! I have checked the privacy settings of the videos and they are all put to public, but it just doesn't work! I am sorry if this review is hurtful in anyway but I am just frustrated with the fact of spending hours on my artwork and getting absolutely no views at all."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really like tiktok because I was able to find something like a community there. But these days, I get 1-2 pieces of content before 1-2 ads and a live about religous or political pettiness. My fyp page has devolved into a combination of content I like and content I wish would just go away. Oh right, there's ways to say not interested, but of course that doesn't seem to do anything to change what shows up. It's an okay app"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It has been a great app. However... recently some of the videos won't play but the audio will. I have to swipe left to see the video actually play. When I go back it takes me back to another video that has had the same issue earlier.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"In general, the application is interesting, but almost 2 times a month it starts to crash and simply stops working, it is simply impossible to open it, you have to delete the application along with all the drafts, which in the end cannot be restored, this did not happen at the beginning of use"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"On my old Google Pixel 6a, I could double tap the screen and pause the background, which would also pause it on the home screen. The option is missing on my Samsung S23 Ultra, so the background is always in motion. It's cool, but would be great if it had the pause functionality"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have had tiktok for 3 or so years. I've not had many problems with it, other than some annoying updates. Now, it kicked me out of my account. And I thought it was banned, but it isn't. And every time I try to log into my account, it says ""no internet"". My internet is perfectly fine??? Please fix this, or 2 starts will likely turn into 1."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Everytime I open or close something it just does something wacky or it takes a long time for it to come back, there was this one time that when I exited the things where you make your videos. The screen just rotated 360 degrees and then left. Fix this please."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"randomly removes features from certain users with no reason and never responds to reports or questions about it. I lost the slideshow feature a while ago, and left 4 reports that have all been ignored. EDIT: since this, I have updated the app and left more reports, that continue to be ignored, and the issue has not been solved"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app, but there are some circumstances. If you accidentally click ""skip all"" on a photosensitive video, it doesn't let you undo immediately. You have to go to settings to turn it off. And I can't find display in settings to turn it off."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Probably one of the most addictive apps ever made. Not necessarily a good thing though sometimes I've found myself scrolling mindlessly like I don't even have a brain, there's a lot of misinformation, propaganda and just negativity in tons of ways but it can also be good for making friends and having fun. If you can find the right people it's a great space, but it also is an app with TONS of bullying which sucks"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is the second time that the app stopped opening. The first time it happened a few months ago, I tried other suggestions like turn off and on again the phone, but nothing worked so I had to uninstalled it and reinstalled it. It happened after the latest version update, just like this time. Will this issue be fixed? Or do I have to go through this process everytime the app gets an update ?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I closed to love this app. But now I permit it to access my pics and videos. I cannot post anything. Also, my biggest complaint is I post a video with music and it's silenced immediately. I take it from a page that's obviously not muted. It's also up on like 100 other pages and they are not bothered. It's like I'm targeted. I don't understand and have not been able to have it explained to me."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have been using it for a while and It's all in all really good but since some time the app won't open for me whenever a new update is released and the only way to fix this is by reinstalling the app which is tiresome (I got a few TikTok accounts and I need to log in to them again whenever I reinstall the app which I have to do every time an update is released) I don't know how long I'll keep this up before permanent deinstallation. Pls fix this, then it's top and worthy of 5 stars to me."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy watching the short videos from all walks of life. The live videos are interesting too! I love the fact that anyone can create videos with all of the effects, the music add on, and other tools, in making my short video to enhance it...as well as sharing them❤️🥳🙃"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Algorithms need an update. I am so tired of seeing the exact same videos show up. In addition, when an option is offered for ""not interested in live videos"" and is selected... HONOR it!!!! I AM NOT INTERESTED IN SEEING LIVE VIDEOS THAT I DO NOT SELECT!!!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's alright, I barley have much to complain about as a watcher, but as someone who posts, the ability to edit posted videos is needed. I can't edit the caption or add hashtags after the video is posted and it's really disappointing. Alot of my videos could have had more traction but I forgot some tags and now I can't add them without deleting and reposting the whole video. Please give us an edit option"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is good and I have had it for very long, But today everytime I tried to open it I'd just get out of it and I tried going to the app store and pressing open but it just shows the tiktok logo for hours. It just won't budge and this happened before and I reinstalled it but forgot the pass for my acc so made a new one and now it happens again. Please fix this it's annoying. I read some of the reviews and about 4 people have the same problem or more."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Overall a good app, easy to post videos and all that. But it takes up a ton of space and will not show any of my downloaded pictures past a few months ago, no idea why. When I go to change my PFP it doesn't show anything new except pictures from my camera."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"1 star i'm giving you cause the last update u deleted the function of auto text on voice, the one that appears by just clickling the text, Now you have to record your voice to do so which it sucks. Also the crazy algorythm not to go viral is damn difficult, also functions that some countries has and some don't is discriminatory IT SUCKS. Also to be careful to express our opinions without getting notified that you deleted the comments bc u find it offensive which is not even offensive. And more"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,An overall fairly good experience... I enjoy the videos and photos on the app. Many improvements have been made since I first started using the app. Keep up the good work. Unfortunately their also little that is done against bullies and people who are not respectful and educated. Especially in the case of handicap. Or other differences.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Won't let me open the app so I have to uninstall the app then reinstall it, which is a pain. If you can't fix it then please do Update: this problem is fixed for me but it won't let me make the tiktoks where you swipe the photo which are really the only tiktoks I make, I have the discover page and the blue line for some reason. Yes its nostalgic I guess but fix omd"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Did not like getting logged out of my account and then not being able to log back in despite the email being correct. It kept saying the email wasn't registered in their systems and I thought that was weird. Anyways, TikTok figure it out. I do not want to lose my TikTok account that I've had for years and lose everything"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Look man,the app is grate, bat when l scroll and like, favorite, or whatever on the app for not even an hour, and l get the ''you're tapping too fast,take a break'' message pops up and persists for a full 24 hour day, come on man that's ridiculous.Evne more so when you get you know that l take breaks several hours long each time to prevent this,and it still happens.godsend though, the 'you've been on while, go outside''message has since stopped.Thank you.peroson found this help"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"App is really good the problem is the fact that it lags a lot on some old devices wich makes it really hard to use, the other problem is the constant change of the algorithm, if you're trying to become famous it'll be really hard since you cam get shadowbanned easily and etc. Overall rate: 4/5 Stars"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This is the most foul app I've yet to come across. This app has very inappropreate advertisments and I really think that this app should reconsider what they think is child friendly and safe for advertising. I have seen one repetitive ad about this app about a kangaroo and her cub but all of the motions and actions make it make no sense and seem almost inappropriate and as if something else is going on. No wonder kids these days are brain dead.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I use TikTok alot but one thing that's annoying is that you can't search for slideshow in the search bar, even though slideshows were released more than a year ago. There were many times where I wanted to search for certain slideshows but all there is are videos, please fix this. (edit) 3 stars now because I can't like other people's reposts and see when they have reposted a video anymore. My review is insignificant but it's probably what most of people on TikTok want"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing, being completely honest I'm probably addicted. But there's one thing that I think tiktok should add. Maybe make it so you can block sounds you don't like from popping up on your fyp. You can block creators and say not interested to videos but when there's a popular sound I don't like it will keep showing up on my fyp and I think it would be great if we had a chance to block those sounds because it can be really irritating having to hear something you don't like over and over"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The algorithm keeps getting worse, my fyp got so bad that I restarted it, I can say I'm not interested in the same kind of video 10 times and it'd still pop up, I'd search for something more than a hundred times and interact with videos related to what I searched for but it still won't pop up in my fyp. It got worse after I cleared my old fyp, these guys be showing me Indian content, pretty sure I've clicked not interested more than a hundred times."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's coo but id like to be able to edit my posts if I'm the creator. And if my phone crashes it doesn't auto save and lose all my work o created. Other than that it's a great app in creating a lot of fun videos by editing, creating something for the amusement of others to enjoy."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Not Interested button is useless and feels like it does the exact opposite. I use it on content I don't like, and I just end up getting MORE of that content. Skipping over videos doesn't work either, so I'm thinking of using the app way less or dropping it entirely."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I spend too much time on this app and l,ve noticed that they removed the slideshow feature for some Tik Tok creators, myself included.it,s very frustrating, especially since sometimes I just want to create a slideshow that other people swipe through.it,s completely unfair, and then Tiktok has a tendency to gatekeeper features from creators until they're popular,or, trending.the algorithm is great, but there's no incentive for me to create and share, which is a big part of Lala bahi 116"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"No way to organize for quick reference later. No way to block spamming users. Too many compensation vids on the same thing. Limit the number of participants to a product for compensation. After seeing the same thing over and over, it makes people want to just turn the app off. 🤷‍♀️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I never used to like TikTok and didn't think it would be something that would be beneficial to me but recently I checked it out again and I found that it's an interesting app. Not only that I found that it is useful for me now and so I don't just have YouTube anymore. I have TikTok and honestly my videos seem to do or be more successful for the most part at TikTok then even YouTube. It's not a perfect app because it has certain things that they could improve on but it is a really good app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It always crashes randomly? And every week it just stops working and i have do reinstall it every time. Also not to mention, i cant like anyvideos everytime i do it just dissapears, and i didnt get any notifications of me having a like ban or anythjng like that. Everytime i report something against the violation it says ""no violation found"" this app is so bad, also once you acidentally enter the wrong birth date it doesnt let you enter the correct one. Fix your app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"In a relatively short period of time, TikTok has completely changed social media engagement and entertainment. This platform provides an immensely varied and engaging selection of material because it is centered around short-form videos. Its algorithmically-driven ""For You"" page customizes material based on user preferences, making for a distinctive and captivating user experience."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Every since the new update a few days ago I cannot watch more than the first 10ish seconds of a video without it restarting. And if I try to just fast forward to the point it stopped at, it says cannot play video. This happens on every video I try to watch."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Its fun and easy to use. But nowadays for some reason whever i make a video in draft the sound is almost always gone. They say that its not available even though its right there in my favourite section. Edit: for some reason many of the filters are not working either. Srsly
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Would be 5 stars, but every time I edit a video and attempt to save it it crashes my app and doesn't save. I just spent over 45 minutes filming and editing a video just for me to have to close the app due to it not loading and crashing after attempting to save my progress. Fix it please."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,so I have a lot of fun on this app. but when I tried to make a TikTok video on the photo slide show settings it would not let me . so in order to see how I could do this I updated my TikTok app. but as you can see it obviously did not work. so please would you bring back the photo swipe slide show .
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Just starting to understand how to make a post.Suggestion:it's alot of steps+ confusing to navigate,+what steps to take.Make it easier with directions automatically showing up on all profiles,That would help so many if links could also be posted to profiles.Once I figured it out,it took a few tries.I love how it gets ya noticed.It's pretty cool+easy to block the unwanted.I think media apps that you have in your phones apps should show up on all apps.Make that option available on profiles too.😉❤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The algorithm is terrible. Videos get removed for no reason then after appeal the algorithm ensures few people see it. Tik tok needs to fix their algorithm
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There are many permissions I did not let this app have yet it keeps on accessing my contacts, camera, microphone and more."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Have had tiktok for about 2 years and never had a problem, Loved it. But now every 3-5 videos is a review or ad for the products. It's frustrating. I don't want them. And I don't know how to stop seeing the stupid repetitive ads and reviews"

I have extreme eye & motion sensitivity, & it makes me so motioning that I can't use the app. Why would spinning the screen like a 2006 PowerPoint slide transition EVER BE A GOOD IDEA"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Love the app and enjoy what I see and experience, however there's been soo many issues like felt my content was unfairly taken down when there was a bunch of other content up that was similar and am currently experiencing a ""Bug"" that won't let the app load and have to Uninstall and Reinstall the app to get back in momentarily and also tried my email to get back in but says my account was suspended which is weird cause I haven't done anything else for it to suspend my account.. this has to stop"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Imagine an app where 90% of the time it is being used, advertisements are shown. Imagine being Bytedance or whoever made this, having so much money, yet the likely underpaid software developers still fail to create a functional experience with even the most basic of social media features, such as following users, broken, and with a poor bug reporting system that struggles to upload a minute long video when the app is DESIGNED to upload and distribute videos. It's tik-tok! 0/100 stars."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Idk what funky update just happened, but whenever I get out of viewing someone's page, or get out of the record option after playing with a filter, it spins and that could cause a seizure. It's not good. It's kinda making me mad. Please fix it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"PLEASE get rid of the notifications when ppl like our reposts. I'm not kidding. It's so annoying. AND STOP DELETING THINGS. Bring back pinned messages. Move the repost button back where it was. PLEASE!! Oh, and every time I post a slideshow with texts, it'll delete the texts, and it really bugs me."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok is a really good app, it allowed me to meet my 5 best friends. However there are a few bad things. 1) I've gotten banned so many times for being underage when I am in fact 13+ and all my appeals never work. 2) it is very laggy at times, it even deleted my video I was working on for 2 days! This might be my phone but it is still a problem for me. Still a really good app!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The app is good. Very entertaining obviously. My only issue is android users get certain features forever after they're released. Slideshow has been a thing since almost 2022 and I still don't have it yet. I've updated multiple times and it never works. Please fix this.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,use the app daily but a recent update has changed how the app looks. when i got to look at my interactions it had a new animation that messed with my eyes. if i go and view responses from tiktok it spins in a circle and causes motion sickness. I couldn't find a way to turn this off. so its 1 star until thats an option.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Keeps crashing, closes out, and not updating. My inner paranoia is apprehensive about uninstalling and reinstalling being it has its hugely beneficial method of sharing information without other platforms black ages and restrictions. But then thatd be why it'd be hugely targeted at least for america-to which I say humbly that hackers are only further guarantee the world ends up being destroyed. In the off chance this app is facing update issues then you to the team working on addressing. 🥰😎"

I constantly get notifications that It's using a lot of CPU in the background even though I haven't opened the app all day long since I rebooted my phone. You need to make this App less intensive in it's background activity & CPU usage."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'd give it a good rating, mostly because it's a good way to relieve stress sometimes. Whenever I feel stressed or something of the sort, I go to tiktok to release that stress and watch some funny videos. But there is one thing that keeps me from rating tiktok a 5 star, it's not not really my go to social media app.😅"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app, I like it a lot and it does deserve a high rating it does have a lot of permissions to access your phone though. The amount of content that you have access to make up for it and it uses those permissions to personalise your feed. Very good and I highly recommend getting it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Please. Fix. The slideshow. Everytime I try to use the slideshow it doesn't work. I only get the photo mode. And on my other accounts when I try to use the slideshow it works. I can't use the slideshow on my main account and I really need to😭😭 BRING BACK COMMENTS ON REPOSTS TOO. Great app tho besides those things.

Simple to use and empowers all categories of human financially with its unique features. Tiktok remains the best social media app in this generation. But Tiktok team needs to add certain features like voice note on message, and the possibility to edit already sent message after few minutes of sending. I love ❤️ Tiktok."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Such a bad app it tracks and takes private information because we understandibly don't want to have to read the license agreement which is like an entire book on its own and if you're signal dips for a second and the video that you watching stops playing for a second even if your signal comes back right after that video is now incapable of finishing doesn't matter what you do if you scroll and come back to it you still can't get the rest of what you were interested in watching to start worst ap
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is oddly addicting. That's a bad thing, so much drama, depression, stress and tiktokers who took there own life's live or due to tiktok. The app is addicting and don't let your kids download it. It has so much videos about depression and how much people want to kill themselves, it's really messed up. Please do not use this app too much I myself have been feeling worse and worse when I use it, Please think if you want to get addicted to an app or live your life, your choice."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent algorithm to work with, but it could use more privacy protections and moderation about the use of economic power alongside the dollar to manipulate peaceful people into any action. Typically they get to develop their own protections over time, but it takes a while and usually destroys relationships over time. It's impressive any find partners in the world afterwards"

I am obsessed with it and use it daily. At one point it was taking over my life and my ADHD hasn't helped that situation. I do like how many ND folk use this app for educational and community purposes. However it hard to find videos that you saved or watched before and I was wondering if maybe a search bar through your saved content could help?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My notification bar with the time an battery percentage is being blocked out by the app. My phone has dies twice because of this because I don't see my battery is low.

I already reinstalled it, I restarted my phone even but nothing seems to work.

If I can go several years without getting any and then all of a sudden start getting one or two every time I decide to open the app, somebody working at TikTok has to have seriously dropped the ball."

I really hope it gets to stick around UPDATE - Taking off one star because there's no dark mode for Android. They have it for IOS, considering dark mode is helpful for disabilities and focus issues, it really needs to be allowed for Android. Will add the star back if that ever changes"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"this app used to be fun to make content on. then, it removed the editing studio feature. this made it so i couldn't even sync up text or zoom in on clips. It's near-imposssible for me to make well edited, engaging videos now. thanks tiktok 🙄"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a totally vacuous pass time. I haven't seen anything of note yet. I tried out tiktok promote, but didn't see a vaste difference in numbers. You've gotta have a good video for that to work well, and the good videos get good views anyway. I got no new followers from Tik Tok promote. Overall, if you're not doing it, I think there's no reason to be on it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE SINCE THEY'VE BEEN PUSHING LONGER CONTENT. I watch TikTok for brain breaks and novelty in 30-120second increments that are timely (aka not from two months ago). Not to watch 10 minute video essays on topics I've hit ""not interested"" on repeatedly. I don't really like evergreen content like that, but especially have no use for it at that length. I'd rather read about it if it takes longer than 3 mins to say. This is literally why I never liked YouTube in the first place. 😭"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been unable to even get in the app since yesterday night. I've checked for updates, cleared the cache, force stopped, and reinstalled. Nothing has worked and it's getting extremely annoying and extremely frustrating at this point."

Very upsetting and frustrating"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app. My only bad experience is that if you win an appeal and your content is restored they still hold a stike for that video against you. And having a way to contact customer support is very hard. Otherwise it is one of the better social media apps that doesn't censor content in the West because of influence from advertising and governments. Well not too much✌️
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If the share bottom sheet closes while I'm trying to scroll horizontally one more time, I might break my phone. Devs you need to put a higher threshold on vertical swipes for that bottom sheet. Or at least make it retain the state of which friends I had previously selected. This happens to me every day and is maddening."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Fun app for making videos. It also has a lot of information for a lot of things. I find myself on tiktok more than any other app. Connect with new people. Connect with your friends. I enjoy making the videos I do, all with friends and myself. If you like people to hear your jokes, or watch you dance. This is 💯 the app for that. 🎯"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like the app. Its very fun and interactive. My problem is that its ran by AI bots that make the post and comments seem like violations when its just everyday dialog. I definitely dont like recieving a strike for using the n word 🙄 and im black, besides that how can we dance and listen to the same word in the music on the app. But we cant say it. Its contradicting. But other then that its a cool app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,App is ok but imo isn't managed very well. So many fake accounts mimicing actual creators and feels like they take forever to take them down even though they make us provide all the info for them including the page that's getting mimiced. The following set of videos just keeps replaying the same tik toks in the same.order no matter if I close and reopen the app or refresh it. The algorithms aren't very good leaving me seeing almost none of some of my follows and tons of others. 3/5

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I was only able to use this app for half an hour before I got tired of it crashing.

No anti-bot verification to prevent scam and impersonation accounts. And why does it keep showing me lives when all I do is block the profiles that it sends me that do? Since the last update, the autocorrect they've added is complete BS. Doesn't delete/alter what has already been written, just adds the correction after it. DEFINITELY wasn't made with any language that uses letters instead of symbols in mind"

I can't open the app nor can I pretty much do anything about it. For f***s sake I can't even uninstall the app. (update it's working finally after so long but it's glitching a lot witch is beginning to annoy me) updating my earlier comment: yall they fixed the problem 👌🏻
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I absolutely hate the new transition for notifications & other things. It really messes with my eyes. The way the screen gets all weird. I have chronic migraines and it doesn't help. That new transition is really unnecessary. Revert back to old one. PLEASE ADD DARK MODE FOR ANDROID/SAMSUNG GALAXY!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is not glitching, but I don't have the new option ""post views"", where you can see who viewed your videos. I tried updating the app, unistalling and downloading it again, but nothing worked. All of my friends have this feature and I don't. Tiktok, please fix your app!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. it's the only social media app I have actually, but recently, the new update has been making the app less useful if that makes any sense, like today my repost were removed I loved reposting relatable tick tocks and repost really connect you to someone with our common interests and tick tock has bin really glitchy and I don't get why my videos won't even loud and I know for a fact that it's not just me so many of my friends have been having similar problems with the app"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Stop interrupting my music. Even with the ""open on mute"" setting (which only works 1/3 of the time btw) every single thing you can possibly do in this app, including something as simple as switching from home to your profile, messes with music I have playing. Fix it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Its good. Don't really like the asking survey type questions. I find they limit free speech. The line between hate speech and right verses left is pretty convoluted. They seem to be a bit woke, not really into that. Viewing experience is generally pleasurable though."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Started off neat and enjoyed it a lot, had it for about a year. Now I can't save any videos to my favorites, although it says they save they just disappear, and I see basically nothing I'm interested in anymore because they don't save"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app but I wish it was a bit easier to block users. I recently had some pretty bad interactions and I just wish it could have been easier to block the person from their profile 😔 This is the one reason I'll give four stars. If you could please fix this, I will change it to five. Your app is amazing, please listen to your users to make it even better ❤️🤗"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Where do I start? Well with each new update new glitches are present,the most previous one crashed the app and restarted my phone ,,videos constantly stop and start to buffer the views are getting less and less unless you ( promote your video) it used to be a great app a couple years ago but not any more for the issues I stated 1 stqr"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"While taking the videos is easy as pie, it takes a LOT of effort with trial and error to figure out how to edit them the way they often need to be done. I know it's possible because I've seen others who do it, but for some of the *ahem* older users, it isn't so intuitive."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Despite undesirable comments and more, people have a slew of stickers (animated and still) to choose from and durations to edit in for them. You can find friends based on your contacts. There are so many different types of content. Filters help if stickers won't (if desired anyway). You can take pre-recorded videos from your gallery to post. You can message users without having to comment on a video (given that you are allowed to and they are allowed to receive them). You can livestream."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I used to give it 5 stars but I don't know what's going on. I'm located in North America with my location on and my language set to English. My entire FYP is content from central Asia. I've not been able to see any videos I enjoy unless I'm going through my following. Don't know why I'm being pushed such regional content but there's no way out. If this happens to you just delete the app because nothing will fix it
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Whenever I use this app I feel like I'm not allowed to have an opinion. The amount of woke people on here is insane. It's like I am being forced to believe something I don't, it's like a cult in a way. For example, sharing a simple right-wing video gets take down. It's so unfair. It's fun and entertaining, but quite distracting. The thing about TikTok is that the 15 second videos, flashing lights, and weird music, it's like a drug. I personally have felt much happier without TikTok. Thank you."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's great and all, but I don't like the shadowban thingy. Like why can't somebody like somebody's vids? Also I can't message anybody, and I tried changing my settings to see if it would let me message people, but it didn't work. So if there's a way TikTok knows how to help, please do!! Other than that, it's great!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I have in the last over 24 hours have had a horrible experience with tiktok live streaming out of nowhere live stopped working for me like it was prior to I guess the update on tiktok I tried everything under the sun 🌞 to get my live back and working like it was but it won't it will then it won't I don't get nobody in my streams anymore it glitches it overheats my phone really bad it lags really bad and the viewers and audience seems messed up when I go live now too I'm so frustrated with th ap
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love tiktok,however a very popular style of video is the swipe photo trend , I have a Samsung a13 and it will not work!I would like to ask if you can maybe make it available to samsung users, because I use to have a apple and it worked,videos are quite out of trend now and the only viral videos is the swipe photos ,I don't want to be picky or anything but I just feel like I'm missing out .so if it's alright with you guys I would be super super happy ! Your sincerely,pheobe watson"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Experiencing some technical difficulties such as the just watch ability is gone. The new update had a lot of changes and this app is not as good as it was. Tons of ads kind of sucks now. If your creator you have to pay to get anywhere. The designers of this app are more for money.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Every time you make updates they are the worst thing I've ever seen or heard of in my life. Why would you make it so we can't like reposts or even COMMENT ON OUR REPOSTS? This is horrible, fix ur app. Also, when I post a slideshow w/ text the text doesn't even show up half the time?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app stalks you. Yes, I use it, but it always asks for my location, phone number, access to my contacts, a whole bunch of creepy stuff, and it won't ban kids under the age of 13, and I've reported hundreds of accounts that need to be banned"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I can't get the app to load, I've tried redownloading it multiple times but it still does not work. If I open the app it'll take minutes to load just to kick me off the second I try to use it. In the past it worked perfectly fine but now I cant even open the app on certain days."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Love the app, truly. But. I can't reset my PASSWORD! And so I tried to by login out and it still didn't work. So now I had to start over with a new account. Everything I had saved over 3 years. Gone. And to top it off, I can't even re-follow all the people I did. I can only follow 7 people!! Edit: Came to back this up. So, there a creator who's content I ADORE I can't find their account anymore. And I've contacted the creator on other platforms, and they say it's still there. MAKE IT MAKE SENSE!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I like this apps it's pretty easy to navigate and upload contact howerver I have filtered keyword to keep i didn't prefer they don't work for live every time I accidentally clicke on the live live button my fault the same lives show up but they are specifically the key word I filtered I continue press not interested but they constantly show up it's a slight invconvenience
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It is ok but there are way to many bad things to over rule the good. The first issue of many was that after I updated the app it has removed the photo swipe option. I am not sure if anyone has had this issue but it is the most annoying. If anyone knows how to get it bad please help me
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was skeptical of Tik Tok. The opinions my ex would suddenly have were eventually the downfall of our relationship because of ""positive advice"" she was receiving from the ""independent"" women of Tik Tok... It consumes people, and I wanted nothing to do with it. What I didn't realize was that these people are toxic. They were a bad representation of what an amazing app this is. I am highly impressed 👌 Amazing app. I have so much I can say about it, but there aren't enough characters."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Sofar this has been The Worst update. Adds mid clips and if you misclick the skip yep takes you to whatever freeking link whomever payed for the add deemed worthy, my firewall has blocked so many suspicious links it's unreal. And now due to this update with intrusive adds now sound from the adds continue im the background even after you've scrolled and next videos don't even play, gotta love it TicTok, Way to reach for that BOTTOM LINE."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Does not have the ability to turn off tiktok shops, every third video is a live that I block immediately, and they sometimes even have two ships in a row AND AN AD. I got so annoyed by this that I completely removed it. I love this app, but the shops and now having an option to remove them from your feed is what will drive people away."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Fun, easy to lose time, infinitely better than FB! Update to 2021 review....... Still infinitely fun, I learn interesting things all the time, have found tons of recipes, gadgets, laughs, and clips that give me hope for the best in people."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The photo swiping mode is missing on my phone (Google Pixel 6a). I did everything to fix it but no, it doesnt work. Switched accounts, updated the app, reinstalled it, everything. So I put 1 star, I will fix it as soon as I have access to the photo mode"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love tiktok! The videos are great and filters too! I've had tiktok for years and it's really gotten better. Except for these past few months. You can't get over 300 views, no matter how good the video. Also, tiktok won't let me like videos anymore?? Please fix these<3"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There are way too many unnecessary updates to the app. Removing pinned comments?? Like, cmon, the ""pin of shame"" thing wasn't that serious. Adding a dislike button? Nobody else would even see. Removing clear display on slideshows? That was just unneccessary. Plus, the fact that I can't just zoom in to activate clear display when watching ANY type of video; I have to manually click the button. Lastly, removing comments on reposts. Now I can't interact with reposts or see when my mutuals reposted."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Was trying to find a video. Haven't been on in a bit. App will not load, even though I have Internet connection. It claims otherwise. Every time I search for said video(even directly from Google) it doesn't load. Uninstalling. Won't be reinstalling."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app, in general, is a great way to promote a business or brand. However, the shadow bans and reporting of one's page should be investigated throughly by your organization. So you're telling me someone can easily sabotage your content without just cause, and this is allowed? In addition, PIP broadcasting on live videos is a violation of one's rights. I should be able to turn that feature off. To be honest, it's the main reason I no longer enter live videos. This feature is quite disturbing"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It used to be entertainment for the whole family. Somehow tiktok has been turned into cheap commercials and started pushing cheap products. I can't change the algorithm or it won't let me. So its less dances and signing and more cheap product pushing live videos.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The best, but very addictive. I use it more than any app on my phone. It has great content, entertainment, recipes etc. It's downside is that it's a magnet 🧲 for conspiracy theory nuts spreading misinformation and falsehoods."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I cannot open my app and use it. Once I click on it to open it shuts right down. I first tried turning my phone off and leaving it off for a few then back on, then I tried updating it, I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and still nothing plus now I lost my login information on top of it. So no luck and now it seems no account either anymore."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Entertaining app but extremely pushy. You need to figure something out about the invite friends pop up, I see it EVERYTIME I open the app. I don't need to be reminded that I can get rewards by inviting friends everytime I open the app, and the fact that the close button is so tiny!! You have millions of people using your app daily, and millions more bots creating profiles, stop being greedy."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I had a great experience using TikTok! It's a fun and entertaining social media platform that allows me to discover new content creators and connect with people from all over the world. I love how easy it is to use and the endless stream of creative videos. Whether I'm looking for a laugh or want to learn something new, TikTok always delivers. It's definitely one of my favorite apps and a great way to pass the time."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I don't know what's wrong with this app but everytime I go on it I either have to close it out or it crashes on me and restarts. It's ridiculous I have to go through it every time even after uninstalling and reinstalling tiktok. UPDATE: STILL CRASHING AND RESTARTING.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The platform is extremely useful and I see a ton of positivity being spread which is amazing. If it were up to me, I would revise the gifting structure, and especially the battle structure and coin structure. 50% is a little bit steep for a commission."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I feel like the more I use the app, the more I realize how FREQUENT the ads are, like seriously my fyp doesn't even have the content I like anymore and ontop of that I get ads every 2-3 videos??? Don't even get me started on how you can't search for slideshows AND they took alway the ability to search Lives."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"A recent bug is that a lot of time l will tap on the app on my home screen and just refusses to open,it will make the animation that It's opening but then only flash a white screen and immediately close.This does not happen with my other apps,sometimes i have to restart my phone just to get it to open once.Others then that on my Android phone making tiktoks is completely impossible and the app kept cr ashing so l just gave up and only watch.Otherwise,ldo enjoy the app,Good apps thanks tiktok"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It would be nice if I can rewatch my videos and save them I can only watch one and I literally just posted it but a day or two later it tells me can't watch it when yet I uninstalled it twice and still keeps happening and just now I wanted to save those videos but it says I can't please try again my internet is fine there's absolutely no problems on my end. For the love of God please stop trashing this piece of garbage app the app sucks itself
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app! I love this app, but there is a few things that I cannot do. It's following back people, every time I follow or like a video it doesn't go in my profile everything stays the same as it was before I followed this is very odd, since on my old phone this has never happened to me.."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Rating is for the newest update. New fade away, spinning screen feature since the update is making me physically sick. I can't find a way to turn it off. Also now it says it needs permissions to upload pics/videos but my end says it already has the permission."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It was working very smooth but right now when I have more contact on my profile it is really upset 😔 now TikTok is all about glitches...I tried to paste song which was in my favourite list but all the time TikTok didn't show anything they said U have nothing in your favourite list but I have more then 20000 songs in my favourite list... Most of time they said TikTok is not supporting what is this Behaviour 🥺
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app but the constant change and updates is making the app not so pleasant, like the change in the font and the size of the numbers plus the change of the color in the ""creator"" And now the shrinkage of the video when trying to enter the comments gets on my nerve. Please stop with the updates trying to make the app ""better"" because it's just making it worse."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tell me why I have all notifications turned off in the app but still receive notifications telling me a friend has posted? Also I have all permissions turned off, I don't have it linked with any other social media and yet again you're able to suggest friends to me and people I may know? People who's number I don't have in my phone! Get it sorted."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very realistic yet still suitable for all different age groups, an it seems to be heading in the right direction as far as updates go I like where the all seems to be headed,easy to make friends great app to interact with friends and people in general."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This is a good app and u can learn a lot of thing from it funny videos and stuff stuff that but tik tok is slowing down my phone making it lag and all that other stuff it also just started doing it yesterday and I had this app for about 3 years. I don't know if it's bugs or anything but they need to fix this
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Whenever I click on the app it shows the tik tok screen for a second and then closes. I have to uninstall and reinstall the app and sign in again,then it work for a month and then it will repeat the same trouble. Fix this..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"While tiktok is an excellent app to have I have trouble sometimes with the live button when I press it and it doesn't allow me to leave the live, other than that tiktok is an overall great app and you get to watch videos you love to watching videos about your friends and the privacy settings you have are brilliant!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's ok, but there's times when the app will kick you out, or the ""couldn't play video"" message will come across the top. Which is really annoying due to the video being almost over. I believe that could be a fixable bug?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It was great at first, but now theres a bug in the software that is causing the tiktok videos to studder and cut out. Also once a sound is added to my favorite so I can use the sound it's not there. This needs fix..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I like this app, but I having a problem when I click on scroll button, it will automatically start to glitch out, and my wifi has been okay and I've noticed when I click someone profile their videos weren't moving as always and same as the profile photos on the fyp, they disappear FIX THIS PROBLEM"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The recent updates have made making content absolute hell, it's laggy and the text input frequently glitches on my Galaxy S8 Edit: It's just getting worse, I can't even upload a video any more without some glitch happening. I tried on multiple devices with the same result. Fix your God damn app tiktok"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I had to make a new account because I got a new phone and the app previously informed me that they just gave my phone number to someone else, and I couldn't log back in. Staff did inform me I stopped having the ability tolike and follow because my new account was flagged for spam. They proceeded to ignore me when I asked if it could be fixed, and also when I asked how long I would be flagged. It's been over a month now. I can still favorite, comment, and post, so fat load of good flagging does."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"the content that is spreading because of tiktok is making the environment for younger generations at the worst possible. Please make this app good again, like good old days, please, if you care for children's safety"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,They mute and remove your videos without any explicable reason... a very harsh platform which doesn't acknowledge and appreciate your hard work. If you remove someone's video or mute it you must guide them properly that what is the reason behind it and how it can be fixed. Too much authoritative app that doesn't allow you to use your profile your way.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"looks even more reliable, I just scrolled past 101 videos/live streams and only recommend one ad for KFC. If you are having issues with the app, I recommend creating content for TikTok and then watching the platform for a more reliable experience. Best times to watch the platform is after 3pm or during the weekend, the more frequent you watch at the same time changes the advertisement frequency."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Somehow even after I quit the app, it's still playing audio. In the background, there's no notification about it, there's no option in settings to turn it off, and the media is settings in Android. Don't show anything playing audio."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Every time tiktok upgrades, it does some weird stuff. Now, in the live, there is an unusual amount of static noise in the background, and everyone has to mute their mics to reset the sound. I don't like that at all."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app, but for some reason, I can't message or talk to any of my friends. But I can do some great stuff like watch relatable videos, look up who I'm following, and so much more. It also has been buffering really frequently, so TikTok, please fix this."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible app, no logic or consistency, routinely shadowbans the exact same filters that get thousands of view on other, newer accounts, just all around the worst. If it weren't for the creativity of the half dozen creators I care about, I'd delete this thing entirely. I've already given up posting content as pointless and frustrating. Terrible app. Wish there was a better alternative."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Overall tiktok has been a great app up until recently Recently adds have started cutting in WHILE you watch clips, so not only in between clips but during as well, please tiktok, adds are already annoying, this is ruining everything alot. Kindly assess your like of adds before downloading tiktok."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love all the access to any activity possible is right at our fingertips but my main complaint is that the whole inbox on the DM ineeds some work. If somebody gets numerous new followers everyday then you have to sort through all them to find any real message. It should also have a thing where messages can be filtered possibly or something. Oraybe even certainessahes could be fixed to be sent to your text app also or something like that
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"i really enjoy tiktok its a great way to fill up free time.but,i m contantly having this glitch where my tiktok is stuck at an old version. my repost button disapears then turn up randomly which i find is really annoying and i m missing alot of features. i ve tried updating which has not worked and i have also tried reporting it as a problem but nothing happend. id would really appreciate if you fixer this Please unfreezmyaccount"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Usually the app works no problem. However in the past few days after i did the recent update the app does not update my likes, deletes videos i send to friends, and doesn't let me scroll up in chats with friends. Hope they fix it soon."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"(old) Tik tok is an amazing app, but the fact that so many options are only in limited areas is kinda pissing me off, let me explain, for example dark mode, now I don't really mind that, what i would love to have is folders, i have TOO MANY Favourites and I can't even reach the bottom that the app crashes, i wish we could have this feature in italy or europe in general pls tik tok I'm begging (New) THEY ADDED IT I'M SO HAPPY"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The notifications system is broke. Keeps saying that I have unread notifications. Refreshed the app, restarted the phone, nothing works unless you uninstall & reinstall. The the app thinks you need to be told everything all over again. So annoying! Fix it!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is the second time Im having a problem with the app, the app refuses to open, it just takes me back to my homescreen, the first time I made a whole new account, guess I'm back to square one, would not recommend the app any longer. Extremely disappointing"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,What is happening with this app? Everytime I go to a new page or setting it does some kind of transition. Like the screen will go in a circle or does a slide effect. It's annoying!!!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This is a good app not gonna lie but sometimes I would like a video and after I've scrolled down it would say couldn't like video and it's annoying to have to go back looking for the video and second of all some of my TikTok friend have the ability to send photos (like actually send it to me) and I wonder why I can't
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"First of all, I've never used this app so I have been blessed by my excellent but questionable decision making. Second of all I think you're scummy. You only show off the teens that look hot and attractive then giving a platform to those who (no offense) aren't as lucky. This platform can generate some of the most degenerate human beings on earth. You even taint the minds of younger ones as they dance to songs literally everyday and everywhere."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Constantly states I have a bug and to clear cache, which doesn't work. Deleting the data has worked, but only for the initial time and I'm still required to login. Force closes immediately upon opening. It's aggravating. Guess I won't be on TT for a bit!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It keeps putting me on a private account when I try and my two accounts so that is why i don't really like this app also fix all of the other bugs bc I was trying to post a video and it would not work and it said it was to interpropreot and all the video was me and my sister singing me and my sister don't like the bugs SO FIX THEM!!!! the worst part is that yall don't even fix the bugs like wth FIX THEM...!!!! I hate the bugs so yall need to fix them like is takes yall like 4 years fix the bugs
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've scrolled through a lot of content. The profanities I hate, the unscientific statements, I deplore. However, it's quite fascinating, and yes, I like the old school music. I think it's time that I share a video of my thoughts. I understand that the editorial team has their opinions, but TikTok is not about personas, but conceptualization, constructs, phenomenology, objectivism, realism, and in the final analysis, it's about the truth."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have had tiktok for about a year, sadly today when I tried opening the app, it wouldn't do anything, I rebooted my phone, cleated cache, Uninstalled and reinstalled, still won't work, keep getting the same msg, 'app has a bug, wait till developer resolves issue'. So disappointed Use to love using and watching on tiktok."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's overall a good app. It passes time and you find good songs on there or relatable content. My problem is the dangers on it. Like the Chinese dude (according to Google) that blended the cat and now has a whole gang that are torturing and killing cats. (Sorry to whoever did not want to read that.) Or the people that commit suicide on their live videos. I know you can't really control what happens on a live but it's still quite bad. But other than that, I do like the app and the sick edits."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a pretty cool platform. You can run across some really interesting material, and I found a couple new stand up comics that are now among my faves. Content is a little restricted, but not as bad as Fakebooks, or ""whatever it's called"". I also found some like-minded people and some have me laughing until my face hurts (not easy to do). I resisted the mass migration due to privacy concerns...but then it hit me. I really don't care what foreign gov't may or may not know what I'm up to."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"One problem with this app is that, why can't it also switch to dark mode!? Like iPhone users does. Why isn't it possible for Android?? Please, this needs to be fixed. This app would be more great and improved if you just add the dark mode feature... And it's NOT fair that only iPhone users get to have it. But except for that.. this app is actually one of my favourite apps and I would highly recommend it 🫶🫶💖."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It got worser people. Now there's a stupid effect that spins the screen every time you back out of a menu, which honestly makes me slightly ill. Plus, nothing is fully loading and is constantly buffering. If you don't want people to use your app just say so"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I just updated for the first time in ages and the keyboard is broken. It is inserting autocorrect on top of words im typing, like say I am leaving a comment and write the word dont, it will autofill don't on top of the word, making it ""dontdon't"" and it's doing it constantly, or if I make a typo and hit backspace to go to fix it, it's autofilling the correct spelling on top of the word, like say I accidentally spelled apple with one p, itll autofill it apleapple, FIX THISSSS"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible! Finally got this app after years because it seems like they have good deals on TikTok Shop, but I can't check out, I keep getting errors, tried reinstalling, using different payment methods, etc and nothing works. Support is no help but they ""understand my problem"" a lot of good that does..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy watching the first few creators that hooked me on tiktok and as it goes along I pick up new creators that I enjoy watching. It occupies down time and it's interesting, I learn new things from some and others are just entertaining. I like the speed at which we can learn current events that aren't shared with us by our terrible news stations as well."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love the app it is really entertaning when ur bored and it does not have many problems for me but it only has 2 problem is when im watching it the page refreshes all by itself and its so anoying but everything else is kinda good overall i like it its not good and not bad ny internet is 5g and it gets very laggy idk why?Edit, it got worsening it never loads quickly like it.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like this app very much I watch some useful and educational videos in it but I have a small problem which is there are some types of videos I don't like so I press ""not interested"" button but it seems like it's not working because these videos keep showing again and again and I am done with it I really don't want them to appear on my fyp. Note: I DON'T do searches related to this type of videos so I don't know why they still appear. Thanks"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love this app but the amount of data it takes up is insane and needs fixing. It's currently on 30gb and taking up so much space, I've tried clearing the cache but it doesn't help. No other apps take up this space and all I do is view and like videos"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Glitching. Can't add text-to-speech as text won't show. Can't watch videos posted in the 'friends' tab, they'll just freeze but still play audio?

I updated this sm times but it worked for a few minutes then it's not working anymore.hope to get the photos thingy.but overall everything is super good"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Was a good app when it first dropped now the livestreams are everywhere video and there all dumb. It is so stupid that the lives dont turn off when your phone turnes off. Tiktok plays the save videos over and over again and there is no changing the algorithm. Over all awful experience.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Verification errors - requires a two-step verification, however it sends a six digit code and there's only space for four digits to be entered on the app so it will. It allow me to log in. If I could access the app then the app itself should be fine."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Had TikTok for over a year and now refuses to open. How many people have to leave the same review over a period of months before you fix this. And yes, we've all tried the restart phone and uninstall-reinstall methods. Please fix this."

I tried deleting the app and signing back in but it seems not to work.. is their a way I can contact tiktok support team.. my other social media platforms work without a issue
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok was a fun for most times I had it, but I first uninstalled it because it was showing depressing videoes on my For you page. I took a break from it for a long while, after reinstalling it and things we're fine but now after hearing about the latest tread which i'm chosing not to bring up, I chose to delete my account and uninstall tiktok for good never using it again."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The APP constantly fails to open, then I have to uninstall and reinstall the APP. Before I do this, I restart my phone, cleared cache, but the Tiktok App would not open. This has been going on for months now. This is very bad, because I keep on losing my drafts. Please fix this bug."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Keeps removing my friends from the share tab. Used to always show them then it just recently stopped.

But I am unable to share anything to them
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The video progress bar for long videos is missing on any android phone I log into with my tiktok account! I've tested on a lot of phones as I work at a telco retail store. It has been missing for months. Please 🙏 bring back the progress bar :(
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"lowers video quality when taking videos straight from the tiktok camera - even though i can upload my own that use my camera to the full potential so obviously it's not a file size issue another problem is the automatic face filter that thins out your chin, which you have to go through hell and back to turn off fix these things maybe"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great, but it takes up too much storage. I have to delete the app every few weeks just to be able to record videos off the app. Just deleted and reinstalled it. Before deleting my storage was at 98%, after deleting it, my storage was at 50% Why does it take so much storage??"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When you get flagged for posting a video that is appropriate, even on YouTube, it's appropriate, but not here. They will remove your posting ability on this app they band me for about a month and a half by now. I have been posting more on YT nowadays, and I watch more videos on YT nowadays, too. This app is becoming more trash every day. From what they been doing I hope this app goes down because it becoming more and more trash"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It started normal then went down hill. Using it at first I got good recommendations like animal, camping, cooking, funny videos. Then started getting recommended Aryan recruitment, right wing conspiracy theories, redpiller nonsense, and a bunch political things I really don't care of. I know you can simply reset the algorithm and even censor the content you don't want to see, but after a day it jumps back to the ""recommended""."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app but sometimes it stops the video and no sound where there is a full TilTok video and sound. But otherwise great, funny, true ,helping others just don't like the money scheme stuff. There is always double Celebs which send me messages and they are not!!!"

I selected 1 topic that I am interested in after installation, which was Science and technology. After scrolling through over a 100 videos, There was no videos related to science and technology. Additionally, the app keeps asking if I liked the video, even after clicking a dozen times ""no"" to similar videos, The same type of videos still pop up. Finally, when I click on preferred languages and translation language"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is great. I met some great people to call friends, but I've been waiting for my appeal to be reviewed for weeks! I got a notification saying I violated guidelines and ""temporarily suspended"" from sending messages. I did all the proper steps to send in a photo of my ID, face, code, and my email for then to send it to. And ya know what? I've been waiting for probably more than 2 weeks already!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app for watching videos. BUT it keeps asking me to sync everything with tiktok and its VERY ANNOYING. It's like ""press this button to allow Tiktok to sync with Facebook"" and if you click ""no"" it keeps asking you later. So annoying."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,My favourite thing about this app is that the users are representative of the world. I see so many people with hair and facial features like mine. And mostly the only white people on my for you are movie stars it's pretty good tdc. It's lovely so far it's a bit complicated to learn the different functions but it's always fun 🤪
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It doesn't matter what you like, dislike, favorite, or block. The app will simply present to you what it wants you to see according to it's programming (even if you block keywords). You also can't schedule uploads or conveniently see all the stitches for a video."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When I tap, ""not interested,"" forty times on a sound I dislike it should NOT show me videos with that sound anymore. If the feature doesn't work, just remove it at this point. The only way for me to remove or hide content that is gross, offensive or worse, is by blocking individual accounts. Your support says it will reflect it 24 hours, that's completely untrue. Even if I reset my FYP I'm stuck with the same obnoxious content for days. App is on the fast track to being non-functional for users."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I hate how everytime I update the app, it won't start anymore, so I have to uninstall it. Then install it again and guess what? I have to login into all the accounts again, which all have different emails and passwords and whatnot. Been happening for almost a year now wish you would fix it."

Please fix this glitch now!Update ~ tiktok is acting up again, saying I have zero likes and you can't see my videos!! Tiktok fix this problem before I give it an even lower rating, or even get vid of the app altogether!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is amazing. It let's u connect with your friends and view posts based on your personal choices. It has everything there. There are some posts that don't have sounds but that is from the person who posted it not from tiktok. 🤩🤩🤩🤩
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app im general is great but we've it comes to helping it's complete bs, of lost several accounts because I lost my phone and forgot the email(wich I will admit is ny fault) but I've contacted Tiktok help and their emails ans their account directly but time after time again I got nowhere with a bunch of bs from bots, please properly help the people who use your app instead od sending a bunch of bots with the sane message."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Wow, what a terrible experience. Tried to create an account, got the verification email, but couldn't actually log in with the address. Kept booting me to the phone app, then not accepting the email address I just verified. I assume this is because they want my phone number. Data thieves can go die in a fire."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love watching tiktok and night, but the only thing that keeps me from giving fi e stars is the constant pushing. It keeps trying to change My fyp to mainstream content like weird trends and dancing which I don't want to see, despite clicking not interested. The pushy behavior is the only thing that keeps me from 5 stars."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Hey Tiktok! Please fix the feature that allows users to set a cover image for their videos in their feed. I have gone in and set mine only to have it unset to the first frame on my videos once I post. I love the app. It has helped me connect with a community of people that I resonate with. I just wish it didn't try so hard to suppress my small business. Almost 19k followers and less than 1% of my followers ever see my posts. Frustrating. Tiktok, do better."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is very interesting app. I like it a lot. I spend good time using it. That's why I tell my cousins and friends to use tik tok.It has a great advantage that the video is the same as the mood of the person One can spend a good time watching .every one at a time on Tik Tok Kind of like videos I like it a lot.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm still pretty new with TikTok but, I like watching videos and listening to what's happening in the video! I don't know how to navigate this app yet but, in due time I will! The one thing I can't stand about TikTok are all the sexual, explicit, degrading, videos! I can assume as I click on the app, I always see trashy, uncalled for videos! My daI feel, if you want to see videos like that there should be a certain code, numbers or place in the app for that stuff! That's why I gave you 3 star!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I used to love this app but then when I wanted to open tiktok it wouldn't open and it muted some of my videos worst app ever.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Everything used to be fine until now. For some reason the app refuses to work properly. It lags between videos, stutters, and crashes at random times. My system storage is fine and I've tried deleting unused apps to fix it but nothing has worked."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Even with all permissions on it isn't letting me post videos. The ""Not interested"" button doesn't change my fyp so that's annoying. The ""don't show videos with this audio"" button doesn't do anything either. Otherwise I very much enjoy this app"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The watch live button when watching normal tiktoks just annoys me tiktok always glitches and then I go out of a video and it doesn't work I have to press it multiple times and then it clicks the live button and then I'm stuck watching a live until the x shows in the corner which takes forever and when I try and go off of tiktok the live still plays it's just annoying i prefer when you had to swipe left to view the lives and then click which live you want to watch
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Not sure if my phone was just not up to date but the weird transition effect when going to different dms is really disorientating. Following count needs raised and maybe a scroll bar put in there, and a way to find banned users or deleted accounts so I can remove them. Otherwise it's pretty decent, please listen to your users because we actually love this app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A recnt bug is that a lot of time I will tap on the app on my home screen and it just refuses to open , it will make the animation that its opening but then only flash a white and immediadtely close.this have to restarr my phone just to get to open once other thanon my Android phone marking tiktoks is Completely impossible and the app kept crashing so I just gave up and ony watch.otherwise, l do enjoy the app.good apps tnx tik tok"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,App and adding video is great. However I still cannot get a response from TikTok on my business acceptance. I've uploaded IRS documents and everything requested with zero response or approval in 10 days. Then the request expires. They do spam my inbox with TikTok for business and shop emails. Neither of which can be utilized until someone responds to my issue request.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Each time after update the app it's got frozen & doesn't open. I have to uninstall it and install it back & reenter my account details again. During this year happened 4 or 5 times. It's really annoying.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"TikTok is a pretty good app. But I really hate that when I have my live notification settings set on ""all"" for a person I follow, I don't get any notifications. I don't even get notifications for their posts. Oh, but I do get notifications for some random people that I don't follow but not the people that I do follow. You really gotta fix that TikTok, it's EXTREMELY irritating. I actually had my rating on 4 stars, but now I'm moving it to 3."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great app but there is a bug with my tiktok. So yesterday I wanted to watch tiktok but then all of a sudden tiktok crashed and got me out of the app for no reason. I even tried to repress the app and restarted my phone. (I didn't buy or get a new phone I just refreshed it's memory just incase it had too much pressure from heatness). Please fix this issue thank you.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Usually good except the ridiculous videos that are violated for the exact same thing I see on many videos so would really like to see that change because it is ridiculous and it almost makes me wonder who is really in charge of this app?! otherwise I like it and it's a fun way to pass time.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Whenever the app has an update, it crashes whenever I try to open it. Happened three times, each time I have to uninstall and reinstall, takes me ages to log back in and when I do I lose all the fun things that used to show on my for you page."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Tiktok is an Inspirational app that allows to express myself without feeling the way I would in regular crowds.Tiktok also helps people to show signs of danger and in my opinion that is very safe and makes the world a much safer and better place. This app is also a fun app that I think is a very good social media platform for teenager's without worrying about what your teen is doing on this app.The only and only problem that I have with Tiktok it that they have some very inappropriate content.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It is a very best app for making videos and we can declare our emotions and it is best for everyone who want to enjoy and if you have to be a famous man you create videos on it if you perform good you can viral you can search any video any song which you like or you can search any man whom you like in this world so download it and make videos and fun
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I had a wonderful experience with tiktok over the years. I've never had problems with it until now. Sometime, my videos don't want to upload in my account anymore. I had to deleted the app, and re install it"

Especially during the day ): Just a smidgen too repetitive in my #FYP (ie, a touch too niche-y. I want *some* things I wouldn't normally think of to watch, ykwim? Don't like gettin caught in loops.) Needs better vetting for companies they allow to make ads. Ads should *NOT* be allowed to turn off comments, so customers may interact amd information one another of potential scams. Other than that, great job Tik Tok. 🫶"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I would give it a zero star. My app keeps on crashing, or it will tell me there is a bug or the videos will be a black screen. I even made a report on it like it told me to. No responses at all. Still doing the same thing 🙄"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What the EFF. Never downloaded or installed this Spyware junk. Absolutely insane that one can inadvertently download this via 'pocket dialing', esp since I specifically have my phone set to reduce instances of that. 'Tik tok' indeed - you're wasting you're life with this APPalling time-wasting nonsense."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The App On My Google Pixel 6a will not show the effects on my camera or under the tik tok editor. They are completely gone. I've cleared the cache and reinstalled the app multiple times. The effects are gone. I only have the magic effects
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Recently I have been getting videos from people and tags I have blocked. I don't understand why this is happening. I've uninstalled and reinstalled. I have cleared cache. I have cleared app data. I have changed regions. Nothing is working. I don't have any other complaints other than seeing content I have blocked multiple times.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It really annoys me. You get people doing live swearing threaten to beat people up but keep getting flagged for comments I leave, which are completely harmless. I'm just having a laugh, but because it's just a computer algorithm on just certain words, it hasn't the skills to work out context, and there's no way of explaining to someone as I said it gets really annoying. The other thing is all the fake accounts I get bombarded daily with at least a couple of fake women profiles,"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Take that stupid transition away. It looks like a project a 12 year old does for a PowerPoint. So instead of taking the transition away you added it to a different spot. You have made this app even less enjoyable. Good job.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Love it. Changing to a 3 because every time I press more on captions it freezes. I have to force stop the app every time it does this because the sound won't quit playing and I can't view anything. How this update stops that from happening
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The apps are ok in this case. The problem is that sometimes he always TIktok is cannot responding 😔 How many times did it unstall and install?These apps and if Sometimes I still have a problem, my friends' messages will suddenly disappear and the effects I don't know 🥺"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,TL;DR Not a healthy app. ⚠️ I have seen are the ads that promote body dysmorphia and self hate. Definitely a great way to to let yourself and your kids be a guinea pig for algorithms. I think we should be able to enter the app silently without videos automatically playing. I also think that the app poses great risk to personal privacy. And my biggest concern: Algorithms and tracking as related to my child. this is a straight up hardcore drug for folks that deal with ADHD tendencies.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very good app to use I highly recommend it! But there are sometimes a few glitches and bugs with the app and it can run slow but that's probably why you need to update tiktok but I highly recommend it because you can make friends,maybe a lover?,videos! Who knows maybe you will be famous!🤩"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely HATE when creators of apps and or companies push consumers to download an app to get a full view of something. There should be a law against this. Everytime I hit something on their website, instantaneously it went to the playstore wanting me to download this stupid app. And Im not even gonna use it! It was just a stupid app I had to download for a few minutes to get a full view of something I wanted to see. WTH! This was a waste of extra time and space on my phone!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Update:: Still the same issue!!! When someone sends a link for a video, I click to watch, and it will not let me go to the app. It takes me to play store and gives me the option to update the app. Which I have for several days in a row"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Too much moderation. No easy way to filter foryou pages. If you don't like someone's content you can't just block them easily. If you like the subject and press not interested it assumes you don't like the subject. To block them you have to jump thru hoops. It also heavily pushes liberal political bias. Was not like this until after the hearings in congress in US.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Awesome updates, information, picture 89,% by good Sound background poor. If you are trying to leave a comment or an expression the sound is so loud until you cannot leave a message to party performing The Sound interferes with the message that you're leaving."

Sometimes I feel like you guys are desperate because I swear, everytime I get an ad from this app, I can't exit off the ad. So I have to just exit off the entire app and reload it. Put an x so I can exit off the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The algorithm be off sometimes I don't know what's up with that cuz I noticed when I put effects in after I made the words a certain size for as the size of the font and when I repost it comes out too big and some of the words be cut off from the screen and copywritten material shouldn't be accessible to download

I use it a lot and its really entertaining for me,since i can watch videos that talk about my interests.Sometimes i do get weird or useless videos,but it rarely happens and i just refresh the app.There are tiny bugs that arent that noticeble so it doesnt really annoy me. Overall,recommend this app,really great and fun,has good content depending on your FYP,and i do learn some stuff from there. :D"

You can watch so many cool videos but sometimes I randomly have to remake my account because somehow it disappears. But I love everything else😊👍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is definitely meant for content creators and those who follow such works. It's a definite must-have app that does so much as it entertains, informs, and educates. There's an endless list of possibilities on how one can use this app as a marketing tool for one's business ventures and the likes. As a creative director, it has now become an absolute essential everyday app for generating various ideas as well as learning from others that are on another level."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Trash app , crashed and wouldn't open again even after reset that's pretty fishy. Uses almost 10% of my storage which makes no sense for a 80mb app , can't upload unless I use actual wifi and not my phone service, it's a hassle to post anything, and you striked my own creative content it's a bs trash app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This is ridiculous now. 6 random lives in a row then 2 ads and then one regular videos only to start the process over after that video. It repeats videos a lot like 4 in a row to up to 8 in a row. This is kind of pointless now
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Recently l've had issues with the app crashing and freezing 🥶 my phone unprovoked. Even with fast connection and a new phone w/plenty of space the app with freeze everything and I can't swipe/tap the screen, and the audio from the TikTok continue playing even after I shut the app this platform is going down hill."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"TikTok is a great app for creativity and expression. I can find and follow my favorite creators, and discover new ones. The app is also very user-friendly and has a lot of options. I can edit my videos with filters, effects, and music. TikTok is a cool app"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,What's up with the crazy transitions from screen to screen? Like why is there a need to move up or down to go forward or go back? Those are unnecessary interactions that just mess up the user experience. Can you just ge rid of them?
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am sincerely sorry to be forced to comment like this,,,,I didn't mean to comment badly,,,but what can I do I can't use the app at all.This app is not good.Its out as soon as I enter the app,,,video. Can't edit and post,,,watch two-three-four videos,can't stay on apps for long,,,,automatically brings to home page,,very bad app,,,this was the worst app I have ever used. .😭😭😭😭😭"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Recent update completely broke the app. It just doesn't open and I get this pop-up: ""Tiktok closed because this app has a bug. Try updating this app after its developer provides a fix for this error."" Very annoying. No update is currently available, the most recent one caused this issue."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"when i got a new phone and downloaded tiktok, i had the new repost feature but after closing and refreshing the app it just disappeared. i tried deleting and redownloading it again but it didnt come back. i deleted it again today and redownloaded and another new feature appeared but again, after closing the app it disappeared again. why does this keep happening? please fix this because i really want to use the repost feature."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I've recently started using reels more than tik tok. I watch tik tok to be entertained and it feeds me nothing but left political pages and trans pages. Since it ignores me when I tell the app I'm not interested in this creator and keeps feeding me their pages the only conclusion I can come to is they intentionally are feeding us divisive content that is the opposite of content we'd enjoy. I'm sure the goal is to further divide us. I'm done with it.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is amazing .however I did have come glitches happen while using the app. For example when you press the button to record a video with a sound the sound played while the camera is just stock in a position .and no. On the camera app this has never happened. This glitch has been occurring for about 1 month and a half. Sometimes it works but not often. I herded ever record video anyway but i do however post edited. And it works just fine. So it doesn't really brother me that.......

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is always glitching to the point where it's unusable for the most basic features. The crew reviewing reports on lives, videos and comments is a complete shame. Bigoted, racist, sexist, ableist content always seems to make the cut, but I'm about to lose my account access for calling out horrible people in a sensible manner. I understand that it's unavoidable with such a large platform but to take away access to those of us trying to make it safer is totally ridiculous."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very Fun, Very Useful. But tone it down with the word police. Words like ""Genocide, Hamas, Terrorist, Killing, etc..."" It makes the app too restrictive and prevents it from reaching full potential, when we have to walk on eggshells."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,5 stars if you let us choose where to save videos. Saving them to the camera album gets messy after a while. Most apps make an album and save content there. Tiktok would be better if it did the same!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I personally like tiktok but not so much after i couldn't even record with some filters on cause it will tell me it's not Available in Android its only on iPhone and I feel triggered because of it,I just want to be Available to record a video with a filter.... I wish yall can solve this.... thank you.."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Bad so far. Since I downloaded this app, I had two big problems. 1 the save button wasn't working and 2 the Favorite Playlist is not there. Literally is no there. I contact tech support and they have no respond for 6 day and counting."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It is good but the filters just don't appear or even work. This issue has not been fixed yet and I used a filter not that long ago and now the same filter does not show up anymore. It's like it didn't exit. 3/5 this issue must be fixed
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Main reason for.giving this review is every aigle.time I go to download the app, the app downloads, everything seems fine....then BOOM it says that TikTok is not compatible with this device. So why would it ever even give me the option to download in the first place if my device can't support it? To take up the memory on my home?? Yeah that's about it....I thought so!!! That's sooo nonprofessional too..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Likes and favriotes dont save and dont work when you check them or favriote something to come back to it. The like button works HORRIBLY and won't let you unlike or not even like at all sometimes, also it lets people with your contacts etc see your account and recommend it even if you turn off contacts it will reallow after some time even if you click no. don't get this app it uses all sorts of tricks/scams and works really crappily"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Ive had TikTok for so long and it was one of the best apps ever!!! But for the past 3months it hasn't been working for some reason. Especially after the update the app just stopped working and when it did. It kicked me out every single time
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,tick tock is a very informational app. do not believe what the others say. The content creators are from all over the map right left everything in between and more. You learn direct facts from sources instead of fake media. it is not as censored as other social media apps as far as getting content that the media does not want you to know about. it is also a fun app for decorating or recipes anything like that. once the algorithm knows what you like it really is fantastic.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Pros: Excellent app. Works as expected. Cons: Sentences in the comments don't start with capital letters. Would be nice to lock the buttons. Its too easy to hit a button while holding my phone.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app would be great but at times when am about to upload a video I don't see the high quality upload option, It's shows up some times and later it's no where to be found . And l have alot of friends but my videos get low views not even a quarter of the friends I have 😔😔"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"i really do enjoy this app, but it doesn't let me like people's post and or anymore comment. i had a video posted. picture slide and it got deleted for some reason, it was just flowers.. tiktok needs to do better or something. im going to install, if it's going to continue!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"the repost button. it always constantly disappears for me and it's getting annoying. Edit: been a few months since this, YET AGAIN, they ruined the repost button. it has a white background, which I eventually didn't care about, but the idea was terrible, and they had no reason to but a white back round. now, they removed the feature to comment on your repost, which is even WORSE. this update was absolutely awful."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I started using TikTok two years ago, and had no problem using until recently I had problem login in, and the error message says no internet connection. I tried uninstalling it and reinstall few times and try getting back in it still says no internet connection. This is the first time happening to me, and it is frustrating."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Needs volume leveling. Some videos are extremely low volume and then the next is extremely loud. Volume should be consistent across the platform. Still an issue since initial review posted in September.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app's... fine. I finally caved and got it a few weeks ago. It made my phone lag a bit more than it usually does, but it was bearable. Except for about three days ago, where I go on and am told my account has been permanently banned for continously breaking community guidelines, but I didn't do anything. Anyways, submitted an appeal which hasn't been reviewed yet, guess I'll update this if they finally realize they made a mistake. For now, I'm just gonna assume it was an annoying glitch."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Rewriting cause ever since tiktok SHOPPPP it now feels like a dang shopping app. Can't even scroll on my for you page without seeing videos eligible for commission or tiktop shop linked to it, for what seems to be every other 3 videos. Same for tiktok live now its alot of people just trying to sell things. Don't get me wrong every now & then I do see something I like but that doesn't mean I want my whole dang fyp to be only shopping videos!"

I haven't had a single problem watching tiktok and it's is mostly age appropriate, although there is some bad videos like girls in bikinis and things like that so I think maybe tiktok could ban some of those videos?

Also i dont have some other options as other phones.. please my phone is from 2021 its not that old can you please update that mine phone amd other have new update ?
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,You literally have to scroll through more ads than there are true videos. The amount of content creators peddling products has seriously gotten out of control and makes the entire app quite unenjoyable. It's extremely frustrating and every day TikTok loses another piece of what it originally was intended to be. I always say that greed has ruined our time on earth and I firmly believe it. This is just another unfortunate example of how greed ruins great things 😞

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I'm addicted to watching this app I love all makeup lives and recovery videos . I keep buying to much off this app lol gotta slow down. I plan on being a makeup Artist for Seint and a partner with pomifera so I will have to learn how to use this app and make my own lives so that I can start my own business and sell makeup and skin care hopefully make some extra income also along the way. Also I'd like to find some true crime videos or lives to watch those are very interesting to me.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Tiktok is overall amazing but there is a few problems and errors because when I was going to like a video it resets or just doesn't like the video which really brothers me and also whenever I go to tiktok first video ad then a funny video pops up right after the ad but then the video under the funny video is a ad to much ads and bugs
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My experience with Tiktok is good. tiktok is a great compared to other app i like it very much Hopefully, it will get better"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Don't really use the Tiktok app too much if you have newer oleds. My galaxy s8 had severe screen burn in and its disturbing me. I dont like the fact that the pixels don't move around a little bit or the full screen mode. Now i have a s21 ultra im trying to limit my use so this problem doesn't occur again.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Addicting af, track your every move and turns u into a statistic for the algorithm. Downloaded this app in 2019 and have been using it ever since, because I can't pit it down. It's always in the back of your mind"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app has glitched ever since I downloaded it. I can log in with a browser, but the app tells me too many attempts, despite only trying once every few days. I contacted support several times to no avail. Good luck getting support if anything goes wrong."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Lately there has been a glitch where my entire screen spins clockwise like 5 times every time I hit the back button. It's really annoying and takes a lot of time. And there are still way too many ads!

It would be great if could edit the audio individual and spilce and copy as well, same with the music"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a very fun app once you get your fyp to your liking. great place to find honest personal reviews of products and cooking videos. my only issue with the app is that there's a lot of false information being spread on it, but I suppose that happens with any social media.😅"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good platform, happy to be apart of it. This is my first year ever trying tiktok and I can say I've found a nice way to stay connected to likeminded people and find a sense of community that I never thought was possible on an app, but tiktok continues to surprise me everyday,keeps me occupied and entertained and really if I'm going to be honest is replacing youtube for me. Youtube has changed since I first used it in early 2000's. Tiktok is now my main app used on my phone! Thank you tiktok 💚❤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app so much, there's actually only one issue, that the app crashes alot, its kinda annoying, when I try to open the app, it says that its not working, like why? If its telling me that its not working, tell me why then. If Its because of space, I don't understand then, I have plenty of space. But otherwise It's a really great app and I use it whenever Im bored."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love the app and how it has a option when you get on the app the videos are mute but I don't like how when you record a video you can look up the filters anymore like it will have the search button can you add that back please? And add more things too?
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Pros: I've only been on Tic Tok a few months but I've really enjoyed it. I make videos about comic books and so far it's been really easy to do what I want. There's a small learning curve but it's like that with anything. There's also a lot of platforms to discuss different topics. Another thing I've noticed is they're not big into censorship. Like it's not a dumpster fire like Twitter but not overly sensitive like IG. Cons: Lots of ads but there's cool stuff atleast. Paying for views? nope
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This app is good but the issue is that sound of draft video gets removed automatically if i try to see the draft video in offline so tiktok creators should solve this problem as soon as possible. Thankyou!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Was a good ap for the first 2 weeks I used it, now it will not open and says there is a bug and to wait for the devs to supply an update to fix the bug. I've uninstalled and reinstalled it a few times to no avail. Should just uninstall and be done with it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,You get a one-star until you fix this. What's the point of saving songs if when you trying to use them you can't because it got deleted by Tik-Tok this is a horrible bug that have not yet been fixed I expected better from the Chinese company. And not be so damn American
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I never leave reviews on the Google play store, the new update on the tiktok is horrible, I cannot find a song anymore to add to my tiktok video, now it is commercial sounds. Please revert into having music again tiktok.! Please fix the app.!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I'm new to this app & I'm not one for posting a lot of videos of myself & still learning how to use this app but so far I like it. The Tik Tok shop has a lot of good stuff for pretty good prices & I have found a lot of good pages to follow. The only thing I don't like is the fact that people can make multiple channels that are the same name as someone else's page & you don't really know which one is the real page to follow! So I wish they had some way they could better figure it out
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Very easy to use and get used to but the reason why I made my rating a 3 is because tiktok doesn't check the posts on their which is about to be posted. If you don't know what I mean I'm trying to say that there are LOADS of Innapropiate videos on tiktok and tiktok doesn't ban the person who made the video/slideshow. So I'm hoping tiktok fixes this issue in the future but for now I'm giving tiktok a 3
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Look--all yr parents have heard of tiktok. By now, even your grandparent have! Isn't it getting too old to stay entranced with? Shouldn't you all be flitting off to the next overhyped app with basically the same technical functions for assembling brief & ever more standardized public displays of ditzy egoism? A newer one, geared to a slightly shorter attention span, in a slightly different format, with a few new filters/whatever? If it hasn't yet, that new bandwagon must be rolling out soon?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"As someone that's was anti-TikTok at the start, this platform (and app) have really changed my mind. After getting my personal algorithm set up, I began to see stories and content from some incredible creators. A few weeks later, I was creating my own videos on TikTok and garnering infinitely more views that on other social media platforms. The reason I only give this app 4 stars has to do with the changes which have stalled my videos to 200-300 views and the cavalcade of ads that appear."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love the ease of navigation in creating videos and also as well as the options and different genres available to help create and promote as if you were a trained professional. Great work 👍 Hats off to the person or persons on your team excellent work.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love the app, funny asf and great ways to engage with strangers and friends, share opinions, spread awareness, and be educated about literally anything. My only problem is what happened to the slideshow option?? I tried to make a slideshow just now and its gone. Also if you have a android you dont have access to dark mode for some reason."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is all good but everyone is talking about the new update, tik tok removed the ability to see the date of the repost, it was literally the best thing in the app, and you can't add a comment to your reports it's really annoying and I don't think anyone likes it we want the old version back please!!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Videos are too short, I get caught up watching this app for hours. It feels like an addiction, I don't learn anything useful and the majority of content posted on my fyp is generally unrewarding to watch.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is overall great, but there's a few issues I have every now and then. Sometimes I like a video and when I go to my profile and click the liked videos, suddenly the video I liked isn't there. I have no idea what to do about that and I really angers me because out of nowhere it eliminates them."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm in love with the safe space it has provided, making it a place to be yourself without much judgment. It has also created more opportunities that weren't available when I was growing up to learn, grow, meet new ppl from all walks of life with different information & knowledge. It's a wonderful place to be silly, creative, have a good laugh & still have serious conversations that nurture thinking & researching."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Compared to other media sites, this is the most user-friendly. As a viewer, I find it amazing how the content that I need just automatically finds me. As a creator, it is so easy to use and record videos and edit them, and it rarely freezes. So I find that satisfying"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's fun. Could be better. Don't like how tik tok forces unpopular content on my For you page. Especially when I have blocked 🚫 or dis liked similar content. That should tell you something. And it's sad and unfair that Tik Tok stops hot popular videos from going viral now, because they want us to pay money to get our videos momentum and attention. Not cool. :( Other than that, it's a great outlet for the people."

If there's people trying to make fake accounts, they won't be able to get past the verification process, allowing less (if not all) people to take advantage of the system."

I really like to have fun with this tiktok app. I have been using this app for about 5 years, but until now I have come to this point facing problems like never getting likes and never getting comments. Until now, none of my videos go viral, why is Tiktok why? The video that uses bad words and the body is displayed is the video that will go viral quickly and the simple video that is hated should not be done by the Tiktok team. thank you."

I was wrong. TikTok is one of the most important apps of its time as well as my most preferred social media platform for so many reasons.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Bad algorithms, but better than twitter for creators. I really wish it would stop pausing any background audio like music apps when you open it. Changing permissions and settings doesn't fix it. Live streams are bugged."

However I just came up with an idea that would really help out us who have a ton of friends who send us tiktoks. A friend fyp where you see the videos they sent you in the chat, and that it would be possible to reply to them. For example ""user03929 sent you this video, message here"" or make it so a few of those appear in our regular fyp every once in a while.

It's really hard to find liked tiktoks or Favorites though cuz over time they build up and you have to scroll and scroll to find them, even when we have tabs/pins for the favorites.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I originally rated this as a three-star I would have given it three and a half but there's no way. I have dropped it down to a two-star because they flagged a story of mine for gun safety or something I don't remember and it was literally a picture of my everyday carry and the optic that I have on it. It seems that the not Chinese government-owned Chinese Corporation doesn't like people showing their support of the Second Amendment as well as showing people the safe way to use their firearms

I got it on my Oppo phone and it was great - I really liked the powerful Edit where you can edit various things in the one mode, at various parts of the video (sound tracks, clip trimming, text, etc.). However, after I got a new phone (Samsung), I seem to have what feels like an older experience - the Edit is gone and now everything is separate and there's no longer one UI where you can edit all the different features."

The latest update has caused an issue, though. When opening comments the screen shrinks, which is normal. But closing them the screen stays the same size, and sometimes even smaller, and won't return to proper viewing size. Please reach out to me if you need screenshots and I will provide them for better clarity."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I got this a few months back, and it's a great app! I don't have much complaints, though it gets really glitchy time to time. Sometimes, when I try to post something it just goes to 100% and stops there and deletes the entire video I just worked so hard on, and I have to start from scratch. I haven't pressed anything whatsoever, however I just find it really troublesome having to stress over posting videos PRAYING it won't delete. 1 person found this helpful."

(I've cleared cache, cleared phone from random data, did everything various websites mentioned.) The logo screen appears then swipes itself to the right. Edit to add: It's been doing this for a few months now and It's slowly getting worse."

When you go to languages, it just has you select your preferred language. I watch a lot of Korean content, and I used to be able to long hold the captions on the screen and translate it so I could understand what artists I follow were saying. It's disappointing to get rid of a feature that allows a more widespread audience."

This is really put a damper on the app because it feels like I'm hearing the same 10 songs over and over again.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,it was good for a while but I recently got a thing that said I was permanently banned even though I never even got a warning and I'm very confused because it'll do an allert that says I'm permanently banned and then it'll reload and do it again. I haven't even been able to create a new account please fix this. And my friends can still see my account and watch my videos so I don't know what's wrong or how I can fix this. Please help.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Do not install this app. My website randomly got uncalled traffic from Byte-Spider (I told my friends to Uninstall Tiktok we have a website with each other) don't make the mistake of installing this disgusting application
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Often doesn't load the video of a video ony fyp. But music does start playing. When navigating to the creators page and click on the vid it does work.. so it's not a network issue.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I've had TikTok since 2019 and it was pretty decent. Now I can't even watch anything as the videos lag so much and watching stuff that is sent to me is even more difficult as I need to click on it multiple times for the actual video to open.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pretty consistently good, lately. Sometimes there a issues with sharing tiktoks to Facebook. Or uploading is slow.... But mostly pretty great considering all the things you can do to edit your videos"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,TikTok is a wonderful app. The reason why I rated it a 4 is because your account can get banned just for you showing like really cool knife you got.I also rate it a 4 because ppl can hack you and get all of your info they should have a security fit for that.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It is very annoying when you press the back button, the app plays the next video instead of closing. This is very manipulative and encourages addiction to this app, which is not good. It zombify people."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The option to remove sound isn't there anymore. And people's sounds are popping up when I don't want them.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Only source of truth in the world.. Elon is the greatest asset to humanity I've upgraded to pro Plus and it's open all day. It's brilliant!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It does this thing were the app doesnt open and you have to uninstall it but when you try to install it doesnt let you.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This app is a joke. It is constantly full of bugs. The algorithm is messed up and is showing me things. I have never ever shown interest in like Christian content when I'm very vocally anti-christian. It also constantly says that I've seen every single video and I should go to my FYP except I follow 4000 people and haven't been on the app in 2 days and I only watched three videos. It's truly embarrassing that in 2023 y'all cannot get this together.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing But I am not able to follow anyone. Most of them get followed. If I hit the refersh account, it would not have happened. Please solve this problem as soon as possible. The problem has started since two or three days now. I have multiple accounts and all of them are facing the same problem. Please solve this problem as soon as possible. I hope that my request will be heard."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A Recent bug is that a lot of time I will tap on that app on my home screen and it just refuses to open, it will make that animation that it's opening but then only flash a white Screen and immediately close. I do enjoy that app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I can't get on the filters I used to be able to and I don't understand why I updated the app but still nothing someone help
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app is alright however if you really want a big audience to see it you will have to pay because they limit your plays just to make you pay for promotion. Youtube is better at growing your audience with good content rather than tiktok because tiktok is only after the money. And will not growing your content for people to return to the platform. The app is fun and easy to use however is bad at promoting your content to the right people without paying.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app was fine... until it wasn't. Suddenly won't open for me. My Internet connection is good and strong. I cleared cache and data and restarted. It's up to date. Just no longer opening.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Still no dark mode. Still slow and uses way to much data to the point I've only been using reels for the past year. Still can't block people (annoying when you keep getting recommended stuff you don't want to see especially when it shouldn't be on the app in the first place) also the not interested button stilk doesn't do anything. All these updates to add nothing? Seems like every other large media app that sucks at everything while everyone uses it because it's trendy. Add dark mode and block.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Really good app but it's not letting me follow anyone back I went to report a problem and the steps did NOT work at all!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,latest update is SUPER buggy! its not loading videos anymore and if I click back it goes back to my FYP instead of to the previous page I was on (like my notifications)
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's nice but when I tap on effects the word time isn't there, I also want to make my videos in slow motion"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am very fascinated about seeing and chatting with other people around the world. Tik Tok, gives me that ! THANKS !!! Still feel tha same way.😁👍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I love TIKTOK but not anymore this was so annoying they wouldn't let me change my private account to public. They said I am 11 I am when I am NOT.just because I made one mistake with my birthday does not mean anything.when I signed in it was already in private UGH so annoying I would not recommend.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This is a great feature but I don't have the option of direct message so please TikTok I request that we provide the option of direct message thank you
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"there's much more issues with my gyp either repeating the same videos I've saw in that day or not loading more videos, not to mention the app is slow"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Since UMG removed all good music from tiktok u basicly cant upload anything without it getting muted. that rly is the downfall of tiktok.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"At first it was working Fine. I had network issues and I'm trying to login bny account now it's not going through, I have also tried Forgot password bits not working. Atrbthis point I'm totally disappointed with this app. If not resolved it would be the worst app so far."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Should not get any stars. You have fake profiles and scammers but the people who genuinely want to chat and find a real person gets smacked with a suspended account. Utter BS. And now a second time and I have barely logged on. Deleting this fake s@#$
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's disgusting how often reporting users and comments isn't taken seriously. Several times I've reported underage children, scammers messaging me about winning things, scammers pretending to be other people, threatening comments, ect. Every single time, my report status comes back with ""no violations"" found. I also choose to hide certain ads, or hide TikTok Lives, but am still shown the same ad and live feeds over and over again. Be careful with this app, it is NOT SAFE!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's addictive, mind numbing, and, within 24 hours of me posting my very first video I was hit with a violation (which I never broke the rules) and then hit with a strike immediately afterwards. Ridiculous app ran by even more ridiculous people. 0/10, I hate this app. - edit: oh and free 🍉 (if you know, you know)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Why you keep update every week and when I scroll videos it doesn't show the images or video make it correct?
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"such a time sink... And I know what you're thinking. ""Well don't use it"" ""uninstall it then"" ""have some self control"" But there's so much more than just doing that. It's a form of social activity that a plethora of people use & communicate with one another through. This world is so ""on the web"" & it's hard to find people who aren't. To be relevant with others, it *almost* feels mandatory to use. Don't get me wrong, some content creators post some beautiful stuff. But it's mostly a time sink"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The shop is a complete scam just like the ""customer service"" department. Use your time in something useful. Develop a hobby. Take w walk, don't waste it on this garbage app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love the app on a casual basis, not healthy on a 4-hour basis. Use at discretion. XD I do have one problem with it: A bunch of governments are suspicious of it, so I have no idea how long I can continue to use this video-version, vastly improved cousin of Reddit. Hmmm... Hopefully, our freedom of expression (education & communication) wins out in the private sector. ...but it doesn't work right now... (2023.10.13)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,To many ads. Every third video is an advert just now and the amount of scammers on the app who try and get you to buy content via DMs is shocking
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It's slow never wants to work constantly saying that I have no network I have no internet keeps spitting never wants to play and cuts out in the buffs constantly
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app is good . but i cannot message someone on tiktok. Please solve this problem thankyou😇
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Constantly getting the ""no internet connection"" so the comments and likes aren't showing up! So frustrating!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love this app!!! Don't ban it. I know this probably won't be heard but this app has changed my life for the better. I can make others happy and enjoy myself while doing so. This app has its flaws but it helps us build a positive community.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app has been incredibly helpful and informative. I highly recommend it to Instagram users as the follower reports are vital for social media. I've had a wonderful experience with this app and found the topics to be very interesting.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Honestly i spend 24/7 on tiktok but what i like is it gives me a timer during night telling me to go to bed and recently I've spent less time on it which i like
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app overall, however, I cannot access direct messages. Edit: i can now access direct messages."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"EDIT: I hope this ban happens over here in the U.S., I'm still getting half naked 17 and younger women, from hostile accounts stealing and spamming false contents. Like this is unreal. I just want to watch trucks, trains, history channel stuff that I constantly like, not what I report saying I don't want to see this stuff. Improve please Why is the software code so messed up on this that it only makes your app that much more worse than Myspace. Thanks for adding me to gov't list of pedophiles."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The latest updates have been horrible, fully ruining my experience, with bugs, and removing features that had no purpose of being deleted, as well as adding some unnecessary and useless overall features. I'm not satisfied with the latest TikTok update. Edit: It's gotten a little better, but now the app sometimes randomly crashes."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Taking away, and giving back ability to use interactive slideshow for me must've been looking fun I guess"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Even after I have updated the app it won't connect to the Internet. It pauses every video it keeps saying my internet is unstable even though it is not no matter what Internet I use rather it be mobile data or home Internet and yes I have uninstall reinstalled and cleared the cache it does nothing.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,What the hell is this??? I'm fed up of these irrelevant ads...I have uninstalled this app because of too much ads.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I Love this app but problem is that there is too much attention given on famous content makers and making the starters have very little views. That content maker could be skilled in what they do but they don't get views, others by just posting a simple thing they gat to be famous while the others work hard but don't get noticed. This is the only problem for me, the rest it's amazing 👏"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,App promotes scams in various shapes or forms. There is no real customer support to which you can appeal and refunds requests are reviewed after months and denied.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,A very bad app people make a video then they put a picture of them naked and say did you get that i am very disappointed at tiktok for letting this happen and i hop they will fix it

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's not good it keeps freezing up and it's not my phone i had it checked and it's getting very boring and Way too many scammers
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Imagine getting restricted from sending dms for something that doesn't go against your guidelines and then look up how long you would be restricted for and find out that it's been well beyond that time. Then there's the dumb recommendations when you go to the search bar and half of what's listed isn't what I view and are in fact highly inappropriate. Almost as bad as Instagram.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Literally all that's on it is ads now. I see one actual post and then 4 or 5 in a row all trying to sell something.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,i think ya'll need to remove slideshow it 's boring and people put not good thing's there other than that it's perfekt and the best app in 2024

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Can't report accounts that are impersonating people bc they require you to enter the user name but bring up no search results even if the username is used on tiktok.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I love this app but literally EVERYTHING I say gets reported as offensive when it's not. This app is becoming way too harsh with its reasons for taking comments down. They've even notified me that my account may be taken down if my comments keep getting reported. But like it's the apps fault...
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Used to be a great app but 85% of the videos that I see now are just ads. I'm never gonna use TikTok shop, ever."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Adds are everywhere. It's not social media it's a place for the corporation to skim off the top. No tab or private page is safe. They encourage harassment because view time is money and violence pays.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Love the app, I really do. But I just can't get over the fact I can't use certain features that everyone else can. And it's probably not a phone thing, bc my friend with an android can do things I can't. I just wanna make a slideshow man 😭"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best app in the world, more information than any news outlet, more knowledge than any library, and more welcoming(usually) than any social media.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm not sure what's up with the app lately, but I haven't been able to see my ""just watched"" when I click on profiles. Slightly irritating that I have to search a whole account just to find the second part to a video."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Dude what the hell, the new update has made my app go crazy. On the newest Samsung galaxy anytime you hit the back button the tiktok screen starts spinning for like 3 full seconds. It literally feels like having vertigo and I hate it so much."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Stopped working after the last update and doesn't open at all.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is a fun app, I had it sense 2020/2019 because I had a cousin that had musically and she would sometimes let me in her videos, in 2020 the only hard dance was the renegade, I tried to do it and always failed to, it was a hard dance but I kept trying, and once I got an iPhone I downloaded TikTok again, then I wanted to change my password and once I did that my phone got locked up. So now I have an android because my mom said she not buying me no iPhone. But I really want one."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My first time with this app. So far great news, it is awesome.. Needs a few more days an updated version of this app. Could help it thrive even better"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"No, I don't want to turn on notifications! Stop asking me! And I wish for black theme for comments, it's blinding me in the evening. Do something about ""YOUR SELECTED AD A WINNER"" SPAM accounts!"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's quiet cool but anytime I try to make a template on capcut, the sound removed but if you done editing the video then you come back to TikTok still the sound removes so fix this problem"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It is not working. Wi-Fi is just fine. Internet connection is just fine. Tik Tok is not. Why can't I look at my likes.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Love tiktok, just one thing that really irritates me is that you can only have dark mode on iPhone and not android since it's ""not compatible"". I think this is really dumb due to the fact that not everyone has/owns a iPhone and that we don't get the same features that iPhone uses do, and when we do, we get it months after them. There's nothing wrong with the app, I haven't encountered any bugs. I'd just appreciate if you added dark mode for android, all the other recent updates are pointless."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm amazed that posts from terrorist organizations outright saying that they are going to kill innocent people is ok by tik tock, as well as post that blatantly show people getting killed and mamed. And when reported, tik tock says back, there is nothing wrong with it. I never would have imagined that a platform like this supported these posts. Otherwise it's ok I guess."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Everything is smooth but why my followers number don't go up yet they follow me every day TikTok send notifications every day that someone is following but I'm stuck on 1,402 why???? Yet they follow me!??? Please solve this"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After several updates, the editing functions continually freeze, forcing me to start over with voice-over and any edits I've made. Of course, the algorithms hate when you do things outside of the app, but if I'm going to lose my content/edits each time within the app, I'll have to take the hit. The algorithms hide good content and continually show me irrelevant content. It has been a nightmare for weeks. I'm hoping it's fixed sooner than later. I don't recommend any editing within the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Had this app for years and never had a problem. All of a sudden it just totally stopped working. My phone will no longer let me open it at all. It crashes before it even gets off of the loading screen. Been like this for two days now, tried uninstalling and reinstalling, restarting my phone, updating the app, everything I can think of."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Okay, I have a weird problem. My Wi-Fi strength is excellent! I update the app almost every time it needs updating. I've done multiple trouble shooting steps just in case it's my actual phone that's a problem, which it isn't because I bought it 2 months ago. However, every time I try to watch a ballroom vogue video it takes an awfully long time for it load, or it play for a few seconds THEN it loads again. THEN it's the amount of Ads, now you are play 2 Ads/video????? WTH!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, this is a good app. And I don't struggle much with edits or posting content."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is great, I love being able to save TikTok's and watch them offline or send to a friend. But here's my problem, I heard of Message DM on TT but I have no way at all of using it! Plus I can't do the slideshow as in sliding the images, but my friends can do these things and I can't, I'm frustrated with it and don't understand one fricken bit why I can't use these features......... TikTok..... Love.."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Terrible management... Report system is corrupted. I doubt anyone even manages the appeals and reports at all... I see so much animal abuse being pushed out by the algorithm, and if you try to report it, the response is Oh No ThIs Is ToTaLy LeGiT, nOt AbUsE aT aLl!!!1!1 And that's just one example. Also rampant bullying that goes unmanaged too. ALSO, the app harasses you throughout using the app to alow access to contacts, phone number, facebook etc even if you turn it off in the settings!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When will this app finally open the exact video that someone sent me the link of, instead of opening some random video"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is amazing .however I did have come glitches happen while using the app. For example when you press the button to record a video with a sound the sound played while the camera is just stock in a position .and no. On the camera app this has never happened. This glitch has been occurring for about 1 month and a half. Sometimes it works but not often. I herded ever record video anyway but i do however post edited. And it works just fine. ❤❤❤❤
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Since the update my phone has been glitching. To the point I have to restart it to do anything. Please fix!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I keep losing so many of my drafts because the app suddenly stops working and won't open no matter how many times I restart my phone. I have had to uninstall and install again. It works for a while after reinstallation and then without warning, stops working again. I'm tired of having to start over and creating a ton of drafts after each installation. It also keeps deleting the captions on my pictures after I have posted."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"the app is easy to use, and overall fun to be on, but ive noticed that my updates are well behind. i don't have the favourite or repost button, and i can only favourite slideshows, and only when there's a ""see more"" caption. on the topic of slideshows, i can't seem to make them when i try to upload a picture. i also don't have the photo feature, only video or text. its fun to use, i would just rather have all the updates up to date. if that could be fixed then i would change my rating"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Borderline amazing, very reactive and intuitive. A few points -1 Can't instantly see the date uploaded and number of views right on the page, would be handy, 2 When eg going to Chrome to check links etc. sometimes TikTok resets to the home page instead of staying on the particular video, 3 When searching for videos and reviewing them, it would be handy to see related searches in a more powerful way and to see those choices listed so they could be further looked at; a more 'granular' experience."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the app and use it everyday but like once a week it's been happening that it doesn't let me open the app and I have to uninstall, reinstall and then it works fine until a few days later when it happens again. This only happens with tik tok and isn't a thing happening on all my phone. Appart from that I do adore the app and love to use it, it's format and it's constant updates making it better."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love this app but it's gone downhill in the past year. It constantly lags, freezes up, glitches and buffers while trying to film even on super high speed internet and It freezes up every few seconds while trying to watch videos. I also hate how every new AI Filter is not compatible with my device. What??? Are they just for Apple users or something??? Do we Android Users no longer exist??? It's not fair. Switching to Likee. These problems are ridiculous."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Generally a good app. Could spend hours watching videos. My only problem is that now and then, whenever I need to update it, it goes into some sort of trance where I enter and am immediately kicked off the app and back on my home screen. Fortunately the remedy is uninstalling it and reinstalling it again. I just wish I didn't have to do it for every update. Otherwise no problem."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"the app took every bit of information from my phone before I could even go into the settings and limit sharing. by just downloading, you are instantly uploading all of your personal data, pictures, contacts, movements, browsing and location History and much more. Do not download this app. there are so many other short attention span apps that are funny and entertaining."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It would be nice to be able to import music & other things for posts not all is on here complete song's for example there are some but not all . All in all I'm satisfied.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Took forever to install it . Randomly freezes. Does not whant to work sometimes.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Whoever thought the spinning motion was a good idea was wrong. I am on tiktok a lot but I cannot stand the spinning of the video when I hit the back button. I can't watch anything without it hurting my eyes

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I had tik tok for a few years, and I struggled with depression and anxiety. I had time management issues, was never getting enough sleep, and in general was just having a very bad time with life. As soon as I deleted it, things got so much better for me. My depression and anxiety damn near overnight dissipated, my sleep schedule is back to normal, and my social life has approved immensely. This app is awful for you, and I highly recommend not downloading it and/or deleting it."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like TikTok and the content, but let's be honest, the UI isn't the Best Thing. So please: - Separate Messages Section from Notifications Section. - Make the Home screen more Clear, Minimise Icons or anything else. - Add 1.25 speed or a Custom speed, it would be Nice. - Add Dark Mod - Add more Features. Please consider my review."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app stopped loading after the newest update. It was glitchy as hell before with videos not liking or saving and repeating after a couple of swipes n whatnot, but it's completely broken now."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I finally caved and created an account and the first i thing noticed was that it hounded me with notification and preveneted me from following anyone until i interacted with other users content for a bit. At least i think what is what what I had to do,since Tiktok never said why icouldn,t follow my firends for a week.everythings worked perrry smoothly since the first week of those moderately annoying issues . ilike the video editor andthe interface,s usability . i can see why it,spopular.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"After being on tiktok for 3 years, I can say it's a pretty good app. But, the moderation system is horrendous when it comes to censoring nudity. Otherwise this app is very enjoyable to use!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"huge problem with community guidelines being unfair, always some kind of glitch with this app. gotta update the app like damn near like once a week otherwise it gets slow. there's a lot of bots on the app too, that's pretty annoying. when you first open the app tik tok push an add threw causing my phone to glitch to the point where I got to exit the app, praying I don't get another add ruining my mf phone."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good stuff but, for example. When you type "" Well, well well"" In the comments, you get a warning for ""spamming"" or something like that. And too much people get shadow banned. But otherwise, TikTok is a good app with a lot of different kinds of stuff and all. (Btw why are people soooo down bad for others to use their sounds?)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a great app and it's great that they let us use it but instead of blocking someone's video they should prohibit the person who reports a video from seeing the creator's content anymore which could be done automatically and would cut the workload tremendously. People have the ability to censor their own phones so why should every else be punished for a bunch of Krazy Karen's...
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It appears the app is actively removing my likes, reposts, and favorites from certain types of content. In addition to that, there appears to be censorship that wasn't there a few months ago. This is incredibly disappointing!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The app is otherwise great but there are alot of problems. Like I haven't been able to follow anybody for like a month and now I atleast sometimes can't even like peoples posts. It's no big deal really but it annoys me because I have reported this multiple times and they don't fix the problem.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New problem with posting. Not eligible for the for you feed is broken. I make templates in capcut, and every time I post the same template more than once, this algorithm thinks its stolen content and bans it from fyp. Can I only use the templates I make in capcut once? Does someone in tiktok look at this? It's obviously a mistake, as the template is mine, and I should be able to post it as many times as I wish. Can someone have a look at this, please."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Overall the app has helped me push my creativity to the world through my animation page @Nutzoidstudios.. but the ability to pin comments has been a help to many creators and its a big disappointment that its been taken away. Many of us would want the feature back..
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very informative app I love it one unfortunate thing is that you can't remove the the fake videos especially the ones about the passing of personalities that are not true. Other than that a great app game changer keep it going
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I scroll to another tik tok and the video its just a picture from the last video. I can just hear the sound. Its been like 1 or 2 months that this is happening and the updates didnt even fix that

Im so happy that you have a algorithm but just because I am a male doesn't mean I like any of the things that you're trying to push on me. #socialmediasucks. Thanks for stereotyping me.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I am surprised by those who attack the application under the pretext that it provides corrupt content. It is a wonderful application that provides the follower with what he (follows). if you look for something else you will get it. so everybody should control himself and his selections

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The platform's diverse user base attracts users of all ages, especially younger audiences. Additionally, TikTok's popularity is fueled by its unique short-form video format, easy-to-use editing tools, and engaging content."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's horrible. I guarantee you freedom of speech doesn't exist on this app. You can say or post the most HARMLESS things and they'll take it down for the most false reasons ever I'm convinced tiktok guidelines are controlled by fish! Tiktok is allergic to facts because if you make a factual video and it gets alot of likes especially in a short period of time they'll take it down ‼️ tiktok would make sure your progress is cut! Best believe they won't respond appropriately to your appeals.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I had this app for a while. I was always on it laughing and making videos. but till today my account was temporarily deleted since I wasn't 13 and was only a year younger.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Tiktok was almost always good I loved seeing some of my favorite YouTubers or people on there creating funny continent but sometimes it's really glitchy and it makes me press things I didn't want to press like it will make me like a video when I didn't want to but other than that I think it is well me personally when I make videos I really enjoy reading the comments but also I feel like small creator dosent really get any likes or comments but over all its a good app I recommend for you🥰
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is fun for posting things and liking other peoples posts! Sometimes when I type something in the search bar it doesn't show me what I specifically want and then if I scroll down looking for it it takes me to a whole other side of TikTok.otherwise this app is extremely fun and addictive!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Overall is a good app but don't like people with absolute no videos or they want to share their private photos keep showing up on my feed or like my videos. Tik tok do your job.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I'm not updating this app until these punk kid developers get the glitch fixed that keeps bringing up ads you go and click skip ad and it's constantly showing another one before you get back to the video
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,TikTok frustrates me to a degree i can't handle however it has a addictive taste to it that makes it hard not to think about. I find myself un and re-installing it a lot.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Tiktok needs to fix its technical difficulties when I try to send a video to my other account a lot of times it prevents me from sharing the video and that they need to add the option to block a sound because I hate hearing annoying sounds in tiktok
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I wish that you add a feature that allows the user to go back to the video to which he replied in the TikTok chat, so that he doesn't have to scroll back up every time he replies to one of the videos sent to him."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I love tic but I have to give it a three because they take your music off your live feeds and valolate you when you try to say something positive and they cut your live when you are focusing on something else I love tic tock but they need to stop doing the dum stuff and let people just have fun no matter what they doing except the other things that is in here

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I would have given a higher rating,but the thing I really dislike about TikTok is the whole messager part. You are bombarded with all these people to find out they are either scammers or women asking for money for services that they are providing. All in all it's annoying and very uncomfortable."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,0/5 ⭐ I want to delete a collection. I can't because there is no way to do that on the app and tiktok website. I install and uninstall every time I use this app. Why? Because the app keeps glitching and the algorithm never gives me what I like. I shouldn't have 1000 followers to talk to life coach who can help.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Hmmm... tiktok wants to control how I organize my own phone... it won't allow me to put the tiktok app icon in to a folder where I store all my media apps. Really hate that when companies do that kind of thing. I'll sleep on it but will probably de-install.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It is ok but when I try to follow people it won't let me follow any one so like it's kinda getting annoying for me and hopefully tiktok can see this and like do something about
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I'd love it more if it would stop actively and visibly hacking my phone. I gave TikTok no info about myself but somehow it suggests people I may know. I kinda see why the gov.... anyways. 3 stars

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This has become more of a sales app than an entertainment app. Furthermore restricting users what type of content they post is ridiculous, allow users to post what they want. Also setting the followers to 1k in order for users to go live is ridiculous as well, users should be able to go live instantly. No longer able to save videos I have tried everything with no success."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"That's a very good app There's a lot of stuff that I can do. And there's funny videos, food videos. And I love watching food videos. Because they make me want to get-app-and-go get something like and the animal videos they're so cute."

I'm no techie --- I liked my old account better. Love all the animal pages! Current version is less interesting -- & the separate""search"" button is no longer on my main screen--so I cannot find OR forward any of the shows I love (Meidas Touch; fun animals & dog trainers; private estates in countries that have well-cared-for exotic pets; talk shows, music)"

There is a whole ""family"" of woodworkers on here and we share ideas, projects, how to's, and we even have done sticker swaps. What I don't like about the app is that here lately, there has been a ton more of ads, but it really isn't a big deal cause you can flip right past them. Overall I injoy using the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I used to give this app a 4 star review until I see that there is no protection for people who speak against the system I want to make my own agency and hopefully my friends and I can have protection. The cyber stocking and bullying is crazy.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"likes disappearing even my own likes. This is so frustrating because we work hard on content only for likes to keep changing. Also, the algorithm is fishy. if you start paying for ads, the algorithm will not push your videos out much longer because it starts recognizing you as someone who would pay for vids to be pushed out so it would try to get you to pay all the time by lessening your views. EXAMPLE: Before paid ad 2,000 views Pay ad 5,000 views all vids after without paying 250 views. Also"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is hands down my favourite app I have no problems with it just that there are certain things u can't do on certain device's or certain settings you may not have but all depends on your device other than that it is a wonderful app
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,We've had fun with the App. But they suspended us during Live with no community violations made. Just my 2 youngest and me at the driving range. Total innocent family fun. 2k views total and was over 200 for awhile. Then it slowly died off as I was talking to my daughter who was watching the live at home. Then boom. No appeal option. Just 1hr of content and memories with my kids I can't get back. Shame on you Tiktok. Currently staying other live options instead now. NO COMMUNITY VIOLATIONS!!!!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The in app notifications are annoying. The settings to turn them off dont work. I make one comment, and suddenly I get notified every 30 seconds that someone liked my comment. The number constantly being there is annoying as all hell. Please, fix this. I'll happily change my review if you do. I'm about to stop using the app due to this one issue. It's that bad. I know I can't be the only one wanting this feature to be fixed. Just let us silence them, please!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,At this point I'm tired of tiktok. It's very laggy when I try to watch and the videos keep pausing or loading out of nowhere and I can't even watch anything without it pausing for a second.

I didn't go against community guidelines and still got permanently deleted. I had precious videos and memories on my tik tok of my young son. They are all gone now. You can't trust tik tok. They do not care anymore. The appeal system doenst work anymore. Don't bother downloading, just us Facebook watching or YouTube. YouTube is more professional, curtious, kind, and patient. If 0 was possible that's what I'd rate it. 👎"

One thing I don't like is once you've shopped on TT Shop, most of your FYP is almost all ads or sponsored content or other TT shops. It does get annoying"

To make it worse the app lags and crashes every few videos, the gods forbid you try to send a video to someone without the app restarting. It was good but now it's over run by entitled panty stains and can't even function right."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"We're constantly being bombarded with adds or promos that the app is trying to push. I don't want to have to close 5 different pop up things on the screen before actually getting to the regular videos. You're already close to getting completely shut down in the usa so how about you make the experience fun again instead of being like YouTube with all the adds. Also you have naked women on videos but you are way too harsh on individual comments, giving warnings all cause YOU don't like what's said"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I use to love this app until I realized it's only marketing. Took the fun right out of it. 21k followers with millions on the app and you can't even get 500 views with a post. How is that even possible?

You can have hella likes in a post, but they will say you have no views even though you have likes. U contact support and they give the same auto reply. It's really a flawed app. It's funny how SPECIFIC creators get more viewers than others and that's because the app pushed their stuff to more audiences but not for other creators.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I like TikTok. If it wasn't for their absolute refusal to do anything about all the trolls and bully's on the app it would have far greater potential. TikTok has gotten real buggy lately! Videos don' t load properly! Editing constantly erased! It's like they aren't even trying anymore! Trolls have taken over and are running rampant without any recourse to have them checked! False reports are upheld and innocent creators are being punished for nothing! I know a lot of people that are leaving TT!

There's been some fighting, back stabbing and meanness between some lives. Girls going from one live to another spying and spreading gossip like school girls. I don't like that. A lot of people asking for money. And I was totally shocked at some young girls acting very provocative and openly sexual. I certainly didn't want to see that! Hire someone to watch!!"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's social media done correctly. It still has a few flaws like the audience isn't always genuine but that's happening literally everywhere. It's more contained here like they're on top of it a lot better compared to the oldest of social platforms which one might think would be contrary to a new one like tiktok but that's not the case here. As a newer platform they're up to date and more in touch with today's user base and they just simply do social media how social media should be done.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,still not understanding why this app has been around for years and it's missing basic accessibility features like dark mode for Android and the ability to disable autoplay. y'all take 50% of all gifts given during lives and you can't afford to include disabled people?

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The experience as a Business Account is starting to get really screwy. The last three posts I've tried to do have gotten stuck in the ""loading"" death spiral while saving. Not sure if it's the new ADD SOUND update, or if there's something glitching with the effects? Also, miffed that the most popular Voice Effects are suddenly unvailable for Business Accounts, and the Commercial Music choices? ...some are fine, but utter hell to try to search for. Still hopeful."

First it wouldn't allow me to search. Then it tells me I don't have an internet connection. Then it won't even connect to My Facebook to log in. I give up after uninstalling, reinstalling, clearing cache and restarting my phone multiple times."

I'll spend hours building and moderating my watch history in hopes of getting more relevant content just for ALL of my work to be undone the minute I re-open the app. Plus with almost all music audios gone now it's not even worth using anymore. I may as well get rid of it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I don't like it because it keeps making me sign back in when I'm already logged in and I don't like it because when you edit you can't go back to your edit and they need to fix their language on their because every time I report somebody I get reported back and I'm the one that's getting banned I got bent over 500 times falling with them because of people bending and they're not paying attention to who's bending people. I don't like it

After supporting him on his tiktok I slowly but surely started to use tiktok more. Eventually I started using tiktok more than fb or any of my other favorite apps. It's better than watching tv or just fb feed scolling during my free time. And the challenges and filters are funny and fun to do!

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Despite being one of the most used global social media platforms, some of the policies of this app is lamentable. The unjust censorship of the pro-palestine content is a deplorable example of this. Social media is supposed to be a place where people can express their individual thoughts and beliefs freely. Regrettably it is not used as for its original purpose. I hope that this issue is fixed urgently so that everyone can express themselves freely as before."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Won't give me back my profile even tho I'm over the age limit and banned me for no reason at all. Overall it is a good app. But they should really give me back my account.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I don't have the fotoswipe thing but besides that I feel like it's really good the only reason why it's missing two point is because it has a lot of likes in this and especially like when you can't do stuff I remember when I had it and I couldn't follow people it wouldn't let me so it's okay like it's entertaining and all but it has so much like lags and like problems with that but it's still really entertaining like I use it everyday
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I don't like how yall degraded the repost icon to some weird white background its so ugly 😭 bring back the old look.

Can the limit be increased to 500 words, please? The worst part is that word count while typing is not implemented in Android. I'm not sure about iOS. This is really painful, while typing your beautiful comment. The next thing you get a popup telling you, you have reached the limit. Please increase word limit and also show count while typing a comment. Otherwise the app is great."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I took 2 stars off my original review. TikTok seems to be slipping in a few ways that reminds me of Facebook. I had the 🤢 emoji removed from a comment about eating off the ground. What?! I'm seeing many creators complain about lost or skewed views. Censorship of some content seems politically motivated. I loved TikTok when I first joined because I was able to hear about news events that weren't being broadcast on regular news stations. It's watered down now.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Originally, I was hesitant to get on this app. After receiving many links from friends to random funny, insightful, or informative videos. I finally got the app. I now see why both parties of the USA want to get rid of it. They don't want an empathetic, informed, and cultured masses. Ones capable of critical thinking. They do not want tictok for the same reasons our public schools are underfunded, and the cost of college is so ridiculously high. Informed critically thinking masses question them"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm annoyed that the friends tab keeps disappearing, I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app several times. Updated it, cleared cache and the friends tab still disappears... contacted tt and nothing.. ignorant."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The banning people for no actual true reason sucks. instead of using bot programs to auto ban maybe hire real life people to distinguish if something is truly worth a ban. Maybe also provide live support or contact phone number. I lost an account bc i was eating. In my car. *Performing dangerous acts* yea chips might be dangerous as a snack food but, idc about my weight. Also on accounts where all content was lost you should be able to have it all recovered."

I really hope this gets fixed and I can get them back."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I get good videos, the Algorithm is good. YouTubes is broken so this'll do. I would give this 5 stars if it didn't lag like crazy every time it's opened, and that I can't get rid of Suggested accounts every time I follow someone (or soneonr follows me) and i have to say no, one, at, a, time as there are usually hundreds of accounts it suggests! And the moderators suck too. Update: keeps removing my likes and favorites minutes after liking or favoriteing"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I think its okay that the problem with the app is that they're removing features such as the ""photo mode "" feature and the save feature if you guys could fix this it would easily be a 5/5"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It just goes from one video, to another, then another, in and on. In no particular order, no particular subject. Weird. I'm still learning my way around tiktok, It added my personal information by itself, email ady, name etc. I'm still thinking about deleting it just due to that alone. IDK."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"TikTok is NOT an impartial platform. Deleted my comment for using a basic term like 'buffoonery', yet gives tons of explicit content elsewhere a free pass. Very poor with efficiency for video uploads and audio copyrights (which are approved by everyone else)."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app has extremely biased ""policys"". I posted same video twice once it was in my page but with a warning. But the second the edited and more friendly version of it was taken down. Videos was about the ""Nakhba"" and birth of isreal. Biased extremely biased. Shame on you. It tries muffling voices of people who wants the truth to come out. But guess they chose the wrong side of history. #freepalestine"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, one of my issues are that I can't report people for stealing someone that I like, identity, Because the only options are me, or a celebrity, So they should really add, another tictoker option. Two, they should make it so you can reverse a video in pause, and it stays paused. That's all from me 😁"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It started off with me viewing a couple of videos..... Next minute, I've fallen down the TikTok rabbit hole and I'm spending hours scrolling through videos. Great for discovering fab videos and crafts, with plenty of live content."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I don't really understand the appeal of this app. Maybe I'm just too old. But I don't find it to be intuitive and it doesn't seem to build realationships also too many ads and too many accounts seam to be Bots
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I I absolutely love tik Tok there's videos from across California in the world and so many life hacks that I find useful it's really amazing download it rn but only thing that throws me off is that tick tock shop The tick tock shop looks priceless once you see the products but once you buy it half of your money goes to tax or delivery and it turns out very expensive
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Hi, Tiktok. So I re-downloaded your app and it's pretty good so far. The thing is though, I one day got a system notification saying I got ""age restricted"" meaning I can't do Lives, Coins, and DM. The Lives and Coins aren't what I'm concerned about but it's the DMing. I am old enough for your app, but it age restricted me. I can no longer direct message my friends and I read this only lasted 24-48 hours but it's been longer than that. Please fix this glitch, I don't understand what happened."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall a great app. Sometimes wonky with its uploading of videos, but the one thing that needs to be reviewed is how they moderate certain videos."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The ratio of amateur influencer TikTok Shop ads to actual content is ridiculously high now. The app is trying very hard to push their Shop feature, and it is pushing viewers away from even opening the app. Why try scrolling through videos looking for something entertaining to watch if the majority of your time is spent blocking thousands of accounts dedicated to pushing overpriced knockoff products that will never interest you while TikTok makes their ads the only priority for your feed?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4 stars because i would like an update for me to record 10 mins of video please its verry difficult for me to record 3 min of video as a song is more than 3 mins i had an update it said i could record 10 mins of video yet when i looked at the video time it still said 3 mins of recording time so i would like a 10 min recording time update please and happy easter to you tick tock🙂 Also I'm having a problem with the muting of music weather it be a coversong or accapella.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Just remove this new update, every time I like anyone's video it shows in the notification and message option most annoying update. Please remove that update, old one was way more better in this new system which shows the ""you liked video""."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"TikTok provides entertainment, but lacks effective monitoring. Some content is concerning, featuring inappropriate or harmful material. Additionally, the platform's reward system for spending money on games seems inadequate. It's disheartening to see smaller creators with quality content struggle for recognition, while questionable content gains popularity. The app could benefit from addressing these issues to create a more inclusive and responsible environment."

Started off good, but now it's just showing you what you've said 47 000 times that you don't want to see, plus ads, with lags and stupid videos.

This is an app which does not report or remove the videos of big people and suppresses the videos of small people also. The big people can of course do whatever they want, of course they can show off the real thing or do whatever they want. TikTok shouldn't be like this ?"

This app and the comments, it's a rather toxic app because of certain users. The tik tok comment section sucks. Moving on, there's this problem I'll be having where I'm not interested in certain types of content then eventually it'd show back on my fyp, when I made myself clear that I wasn't interested in it! It's annoying. Not much issues"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Good luck if you're thinking of posting content cos noones going to see it. I'm convinced the algorithm doesn't exist and tiktok picks videos at random to go viral. The SEO doesn't work AT ALL!! let's say your videos about a dog. You mention the word dog 100 times, captions, title, description, hashtags, even after all that, the search bar still comes up blank, or better yet, labels it cat. The whole thing is untrustworthy and unfair."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like the app but a problem I'm having is that their claiming I ""copied"" from someone, in short, an unoriginal video. I do what I like, creating bots and posting them like hundreds of others, so wouldn't that mean we all are copying each other? No, simply inspiration. I reported and appealed this, and I haven't had a single reply. I get that they have a ton of users but if a popular app like Roblox can get a mod to respond to me, then they can too."

Because of that it never seems to let me down. It always has everything I'm looking for whether it's from ASMR to people making stuff creative and I just love the creativity of everybody in and how good the layout of stuff is too , this right here that you're reading is like two years after the first like sentence now I'm addicted to TikTok and I can't sto"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"For some reason whenever i want to open tiktok the app doesn't open, and my phone system says there's a bug? I don't want to uninstall the app because i have a lot of drafts I don't want to lose, and it's definitely not a problem on my phone so idk why that's happening"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Plain and simple, it's an pretty awesome app. I've had tik tok for years and it never fails to entertain me. EDIT: so tiktoks keep on repeating themselves for some reason, even if i like them."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app stopped working 2nd time in 3 months! That's twice I've lost all my faves and bookmarks because I had to uninstall and reinstall it. Not happy about that. Fix you app!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love the premise of the platform. I loathe the inconsistent application of Community Guideline enforcement, the bias of the algorithm, and the failure to recognize mass (false) reporting by various religious, political, and ideological groups. Break up the gangs, already!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Some of the videos are decent but there are some that just don't get to the decent side that pop up on my page and that I'm not really liking that so I have to give only 4 stars on that and as for tik tok shop I've ordered a few things from there and I only received two of the products from them I got two products I didn't order and never got the three I paid for so I will never order from tik tok shop again
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very clunky and buggy. Also, when I post my own original music, TikTok removes the audio every time. Why?? This is my music that I wrote and composed!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"the app was great, but then some of the videos started to get stuck on loading while the music continued to play. I thought that there was an update that I didn't download, but it wasn't that."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Why my post are not going viral?.is it that the app gives preference to only selected people . I would have rate it five stars but I will not do it cuz I am posting beautiful content on the platform but they are not showing it to users. Again everytime they require you to update the app. This has become boring. To have followers again is another big problem
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very bad algorithm. 😡 Suddenly for nothing, you keep bringing my views down. What's wrong with this app? My videos were always getting a high rate of engagement.Out of a sudden,I can't even secure the same views I used to have. I have considered deleting my account and thrashing this app out of my phone.The app is very unpredictable and unrealistic.Today you're gaining so much attention, tomorrow they block you from even getting up to 50 views. 700k to 5o views?😡 Deserves less than 1 star."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This is perhaps the most corrupt app on the planet backed by America's enemies and with a long track record of supressinf free speech and true media of pro-communist and pro-libertarian propaganda. It is the true feelings of myself and many other Americans that this app needs to be shut down or banned.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This latest update has broke tiktok. Now mine has gone from saying I don't have a stable connection to pausing each and every tiktok I scroll to with in the first few seconds. So frustrating.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Needs to be repaired. I have followed several pages, but when I go to see my followed pages, they aren't there. Then when I search the page, it has the button for me to follow. I don't understand the issue."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok is a good app, one think that honestly annoys me is how Tiktok is always banning my lives for no reason so I either change what I'm wearing so it doesn't happen again or just give up on going live completely, now I'm banned for a year, tiktok please fix that. I really enjoy this app, it's really cool but it's just annoying how I'm getting banned every time I go live. Fix this please"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I've neglected my other social media because of tiktok only because it's such a great place to grow personally and through business. Only issue is the going live requirements for someone starting out and can't use that function. So in conclusion.. great app I wish I could engage more
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"this app is annoying me, when I open it, it's not showing anything even if you have enough data.. please work about it a lot of people is complaining about it... Last time I installed it I thought it was my phone space so I warped it but still even now it doing the same please please please 🙏🙏🙏 work about it please please please ... the owner of TikTok what's wrong with this app,its annoying me I'm telling you.i have bundles the network data is stable but the app is not working well why"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,For a fast paced app it seems to not behave as such. Every 1 of 5 accounts I follow or videos I like are actually saved so I can see them again. The only reason it's not a 1 star and uninstalled is the art community on it has to many interesting tips to uninstall.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app keeps telling me I have no network and this stops me liking, search or scrolling. If I want to see a new tiktok, I have to close the app and reopen it. If this is a new way of making me spend less time on tiktok, it's working"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I uploaded some video content, which is very moderate and peaceful, yet they refused to explain why they have denied my promotion of one of the posts, giving some very general automatic feedback. Too much sensorship, compared to other platforms. Otherwise, the platform itself technically is good."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app to look at funny videos and such, but the amount of ads are crazy! Take it down a notch with the amount of ads! Other than that, pretty good."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"As a Deaf person who relies on captions, the option for automatic captions was completely removed from accessibility. I have emailed support repeatedly and received no response. Not okay."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Tik tok is such a wonderful app to share hobbies, memories, and etc. I love this app because there is a lot to discover from the app and that you can make friends, but the only problem I have is that their are a lot of people posting things that are inappropriate."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It constantly says ""Couldn't play Video"" which means I can't watch a lot of videos or even go through my own private videos. update it worked for about 2 weeks and is now worse than before"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The censorship is absurd and truly ignorant, especially for an ""adult"" age group. The algorithm for your for you page is busted as well; I'm always seeing content that I don't want to see. I'll keep scrolling but what is the purpose of the prompts that ask you if you like or dislike the content being shown? Might just delete tik tok."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I like Tiktok overall but I'm giving it a 1 star rating due to it not having a dark mode on Android, even forcing dark mode through developer options does not work. The menus all use a very bright white that is blinding at night."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Was amazing but the ads, shadowbans, shop and the blatant allowing of scams and terroristic ideas have begun to fester and turn it into a Facebook like cesspool. If they continue down this path it will go the way of so many other social media apps, really hope they fix it but so far they have only shown they are more like all the others then not. Bring back the funny videos and the news stories that no mainstream media has the testicular fortitude to discuss."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It allows things like nudity, hate for views, and many wrong things (that I can most definitely list) on the app yet ban someone for ""harassment"" when probably the only thing going on is a small business or big achievement."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have been having trouble with using this app for the past week, it constantly kicks me out. I have tried reseting the app several times and the help center did not assist me in accessing the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"If I could've given 21/2 stars I would, I absolutely do not like the fact that if you have a concern or needed to talk to someone ANYONE! There is absolutely no number to call or even a email address to send a message. I will be deleting my account and go somewhere else. My friends will probably come w/me."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love this app. That was until around a year ago I suddenly got permanently banned for no reason. I walked away to eat dinner and I came back to see a notification that I had been permanently banned saying that I ""violated Tiktok's community guidelines."" I went to submit an appeal and I never got a response back. It made me incredibly sad considering all of the videos I had saved on playlists were now gone. 1 year later I come across a scene from TBATH and I can't watch it bc of the ban"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It is pretty good and entertains me when I have nothing to do and I love sharing my life on it. But there is a few hiccups with it sometimes it won't upload a video for a little while but usually it is fast. Also it randomly logged out some of my family Here is my account but it's private: @hbakee3

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great app honestly for entertainment HOWEVER if I try to write and lengthy comment and say your thoughts on a video you can't write out everything because the character limit is so damn low. And for what? Midway through a sentence I can just stop writing and I have to completely scrap an idea. Please change this in the near future.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love being on the platform and I just switched my account to business. I just wish there wasn't such high demands as far as how many followers, watch time etc to open up opportunities to get monetized and other ways to make money. There is no tool to help someone gain followers. Things are just said like ""just keep putting up content. 10k followers is a bit extreme to expect someone to pull it out of a hat."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I had a decent and curated fyp that I like to prune and keep good for my taste, with animation, curiosities and memes. This until local users started using promotions to forcedly push manele, betting ads and illegal cars, literally forcing the algorithm to just show these contents."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is a really great app I have had it for almost 7 years now and I haven't had one problem with it at all and I really enjoy going on there and watching a lot of amazing videos on there the only problem I have is that the comments disappear but then show right back up on my comments for replies but idk why but other than that u shouldn't listen to all these other haters out here trying to give tik tok a bad name and get this app it's fun
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app is great and all but some problem I'm having with it right now is that when I like a video and then go to my likes videos the videos I like disappeared and I don't know how to fix it (can someone help me fix it )
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Need a search and videos under sound update. When searching for a video When using search it is very inaccurate it will give something completely different and videos under sound will not show you everything for some reason
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Recently got the app, but it's saying I was permanently banned even though I had even uploaded anything yet. The website however allows me to access and says nothing about me having violations. I uninstalled and am reinstalling to see if that will fix this issue. But I'm not happy this has happened."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love tiktok in all but it's also not a very good app cause anything can happen on that app and their is under age kids on this app and their can be some not so kid friendly stuff and teens can search stuff they don't need to see and when it tells the date for when your accounts gonna be deleted and when you can make a new, that's not true, it will just say appeal deadline passed and make you try signing in through Google or something, which doesn't work it kept say something bad happen please"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Very useless app. Videos created on the app are blocked from public views. Its a perfect waste of energy and space. They dont verify info before blocking off videos. 80% of my videos created on the app are closed off. Avoid.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"App became laggy after the latest update, after some time of scrolling the app gets so glitchy that it becomes unuseable. Someone really messed up in the optimisation department."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a very good app and I love the algorithms for one can be watching the contents they want. However, I don't give it a five for a reason that it has upgraded to so much of restrictions of our posts😕"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Highly addictive. #replacefacebook, all still true however to the weak-minded this is str8 brainwashing, just with permission. We pick it and you deliver but sneak in other things here and there to rip at the psyche. I love it. It's hard to break away some days but i have reminders to break the code."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I actually really like it, except the violations of my free speech. Also when I make something, I own it. My phone, my camera, my time, my image. When I'm found in violation, I should still have access to my property! Serious legal ramifications should take place"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The mentality of people on tik tok is broken but unfortunately if you want to be up to date with others you would need tik tok to know the trends. I gave 3 starts cuz sometimes it solves the boredom in some situations. UPDATE: It keeps crashing and I can't enter the app, 1 star."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is good, but it gets laggy real quick. And I have data it's good too, it won't let me see the pictures when I have wifi on and my data. On other apps its good. It's not lagging. But he roast is good."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'd rate a two, too many sponsored ads, when it comes to tiktok you use to be able to see different videos, now they regurgitate everything and u see the same video over and over again."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ever since the recent update, the app has been so glitchy and freezes a good percentage of the time. It was good without the update. Giving a one star due to it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I updated it to the last update and on the top of the screen you can't see the time on your phone or notifications it's black, do you really want us to scroll on tik tok the whole day amd not see the time. Fix this"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok app works great, but this social media is messed up. Users hating each other over nothing in the comments, adult content being posted there and no action will be taken against it because tiktok apparently allows it as long as it does not contain nudity, creators from other platforms have their content stolen without any copyright checks like on youtube. Apart from all that, it is unhealthy to gain so much dopamine in such a short amount of time. I want to uninstall, but I'm addicted."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's got some very entertaining things so it's very easy to use up a lot of time watching tiktok. The downside is all the bogus friend requests!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Huge problem with likes not actually saving. I've logged out and back in, updated the app, even uninstalled then reinstalled twice. My phone is brand new as well, so the issue lies with the app. FIX THIS ISSUE."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"A very good app and has gotten better throughout the years I have had this since 2016!! And still continue to use it because it is great. I said this two years ago,now there are always adds and tiktok deletes lots of my things for me."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I wish i had more organic growth, but so does everybody. I am a creator who doesnt ""follow back"" for followers. If tiktok would help me reach more followers, i feel my follwers would last longer since i create original content with high level illustration/cartooning. I appreciate the opportunity to use your platform and look forward to growing together."

Facebook, let us play music Instagram, too. That's why I won't be on TikTok too much. You take music now that's stupid. More people will buy their records. It's an inspiration thing, thank about it"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,When I open this app it's all black and I can't see anything. I know it's running because I can hear the videos and even scroll down but it doesn't show anything still. It's all black.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,They added this weird animation when you change screens and it goes either up or down diagonally and i don't like it and can't see how to turn it off.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Too many restrictions and not very user friendly. finding that fb and snapchat is better and has less restrictions to users. I do not recommend this app to anyone at least not yet. I've had a lot of friends on fb tell me tictok wasn't worth joining... but wanted to see for myself. As my granddaughter asked me to join.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Lag, lag, lag and more lag. Lives really stink, you get a 5 seconds of video then a 30 second jump. The networking code in this app really sucks. Non-live video is ok."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I contacted support for the text to speech feature and they told me they couldn't fix it because it was for a handful of users.. but the thing is it was working then it wasn't so in my mind is that they disabled it for me..

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I just love tiktok I have learned so much from everyone. I love being able to share my stuff. It's amazing when it comes to getting the word out there about anything.... If I had one thing I would really have a problem with IS HOW F***** MANY SCAM ACCOUNTS are out there. With some A**hole behind them putting bad rep on GOOD PEOPLES name an the GOOD THEY TRULY HONESTLY have done or ARE STILL out there doing the REAL thing. Sorry for the go off I tend to get a little heated when it comes to this

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Tik Tok is one of the most coolest apps I've ever usen in my entire life I never thought that I would be in a app more than games. Isn't that funny in 2018 me playing Minecraft all day long but now in 2023 I'm scrolling in Tik Tok more then playing games like I used to. The best thing bout Tik Tok is learning more and more inspring things like dancing, singing,cooking,playing video games and plus gives you more information of movies that is about to come out. For me Cameron I'll give this app5."

I can't send an appeal because I have no passport, state ID and no drivers license so I have no proof and it's completely out of the blue no warning no time to save all my videos nothing. This app used to be good until I got banned 3 times for no reason. Fix this stupid app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is the best app ever,nothing wrong everything is perfect but the only problem is that is does not have enough filters to add to our videos but brsides that very good But hope you add more filters and effects😁😘👊👏👋"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Seems like when you first start they boost your content then throttle it down, even when the content improves. Other than that it has a lot of neat editing tools."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It used to be ok . Only this week I faced this problem. All lives keep cutting out every 1 minute hangs then plays. Unless I go out of the app and leave it plays on the background then it plays ok 🤷🏻‍♂️
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is fine for shirt videos, but it causes problems on some phones. For example: getting kicked out of apps, slow, not working well. I am a tiktoker, I run tiktok for almost 1 year, UID : @its_me_nadim69"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It seems that if you have used the promotional plan on tiktok once or twice they won't let you grow further generically...your views get suppressed. This does not happen on other platforms...I won't recommend this future to any body...it's amazing that if you pay your content gets distributed to thousands.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,it's pretty nice but it's has it's ups and downs and on my phone is won't let me do slides (I think thats what there calls) But I think that I just needed mess with my settings or something not to sure but yeah after all it's a really good app 👍

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App does not allow me to restrict its background usage. If i do, it doesnt launch, and i have to reinstall. If this is true and not just a bug, i find it malicious."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"After the new update the app instantly crashes. After reinstalling it, it worked for a few minutes, then when I tried to open it again later it started crashing once more."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good idea. Biggest problem is all of the recorded videos being broadcast as live. Similar to the ones just watching people asleep, on a ""Live"" broadcast. Wearing the exact same clothing, exact same lighting, and exact same music in background. Should be a better way to control such obvious abuse."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Over all I have many positive things to say about this social media app. It's origional and functions well. I also enjoy that they continue to make progress with their format for the sake of the users. And I also enjoy that this app is not so heavily tampered with like Facebook or Twitter. The content on this app is allowed to reach many audiences. I have however noticed that many people of color get shadowbanned for speaking on cultural or socioeconomic issues far more than white creators.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,first I live the app when I get bored I just go on there but the thing I hate is that my freinds can all do the photo swipe and I have watched tutorials and tried it my self but it just won't let me. and I really get annoyed by it but overall I think it's a good app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is the best app I have ever downloaded. I never knew how much entertainment it would bring me every day, not many adverts. One advert even influenced me to start an online business which is now growing. Thank you to whoever made tiktok"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is very entertaining. Samoetimes there may be some inappropriate content for certain ages. It is learning experience for certain. It 's at times, trial and error if i am to be honest."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's glitchy most of the time. The report button is useless due to many inappropriate or offensive videos and comments still up or not being seen as an issue. Although, I seen alot of content, that's been reported for no reason when others do the same thing as them, they're accounts are still active. Smh."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My fyp is filled with the same content omg please fix this I thought if maybe I rated 1 star you'd notice this fast but I'll soon update it once the problem is fixed The content does not change and even if i change content preferences after 5 minutes it will repeat the same problem I hope yall see this in time because I'm even thinking of removing my tiktok
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Your app keeps rejecting content suitable even for kids, yet I see constant content of things that are not suitable for content. Now it's not letting me upload any code says I have to change settings yet everything is accessible."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"There are two annoying things about tik tok. First of all you can't put custom thumbnails to your video and second of all, this platform downgrades video quality when you upload it from your phone"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It take up too much data to operate than any other app. You can access music videos better than any other social media app, which is wat I love about it❤️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"But I have to say this app was there when my world was upside down but lost my best friend AKA, my mother. I really didn't know anything about this Tik-Tok, but interesting enough, I've developed some followers, and being an artist by trade, I'm going to provide some content that makes people think and hopefully smile."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"its a fun app to scroll through and make videos but I can't watch my own videos or my friends videos anymore, it just says couldn't play video. I cant make slideshows either."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It is quite fun and entertaining and makes me happy but the camera quality is really bad its definitely not a phone problem or is it bc snap chat and insta gram works just fine it's gives a weird filter to my face and the filters are lagging and not working really well is there a solution
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm using tiktok happily but from yesterday night it's not working when I open it, I came back to home screen, please fix this issue. I can't delete my app because of my drafts. Please fix it as soon as possible."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is trash and super sus. I have 2 accounts, gaming & personal. I went to add my phone # to the personal one and it said my # was already in use. These are my first and only 2 TikTok accounts and I've NEVER added a # to them. On top of that, I've never received a verification code. I ended up finding the account under my# & deleted it. I also get more views than I do followers when my settings for my personal channel are ""Followers Only."" Seems privacy isn't a big concern for TikTok smh"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Watching experience is 5 stars bo question. It is very easy to work with.but I never see this problem with any other account but all 4 of mine.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is really good but some videos are bad. I gave a 4 star review because i really like this app. There are really good tips and motivation in this app. As a student, this app also gives notes . Afterall, this is a really good social media platform which helps us to share our daily life and express ourselves"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Honestly the only problem is the business account. Having analytics is nice but the recomended sounds make it impossible to find new creative audios and they always recommend fhe same 45 sounds that tiktok or someone in affiliation made and they all suck. Hope this helped. Xoxo
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Constantly says there is no internet connection to my phone, so I have to close and reopen the app. My phone is connected lol I'm literally using it right now for this review."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Half of the filters don't work even if you have the newest android and everything has been reset or updated. It's completely washed out with ads and sponsored sales. Hardly feels like a platform for the masses anymore 😕 😪
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Once I open the app, the videos aren't showing. Not like I don't have data or whatsoever, I have a strong connection but it's giving me issues still.."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"it's really great if you don't mind the fyp. Sometimes, it shows you the same trend over and over until you completely ignore it and avoid it to get it off. and if you don't mind the nudes, you will see them and the more you report or comment about it you will probably see more. they take a long time to get taken down to if they even get taken down at all."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It all has been good at first but lately the app shuts down by itself and it won't open. I have to delete it and then re-upload it again therefore I lose the videos that are on draft.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good app unless you have an android, then you have to wait months more for features apple users get immediately. Slideshows have been around forever now but android still doesn't have the option."

I have to scroll through 10 live streams, 10 ""Sponsored Content"" and 10 actual tik tok ads to make it to one sib par video-- before doing it all over again. Tik tok is dead, and we will see that in the next couple of Years. What's next?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The experience is being ruined by commercials. The algorithm is not showing me what i like to watch as often anymore. The app was better in the past.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The only drawback is there's too many scammers on here and they're able to take people's photos and videos if you leave your page public instead of private. I like that no one can message you unless you are following them or friends with them.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Honestly it's very good app. The gets his favorite video of his choice . You can easily upload videos anything. And can easily edit your videos. This app is very helpful.👍🏻

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I love watching videos but as a creator the algorithm makes getting views very difficult unless you have a ton of followers... absolutely love watching other videos though and it's so important to hear other viewpoints and on tiktok you get that...

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"TikTok has removed my posts although no clear violations have been made. TikTok also does not offer the opportunity to appeal. 5 minutes after my post went up, it was removed. I immediately tried to appeal and I received a notice that the time expired even though ONLY 5 MINUTES had passed. At this point I am waiting for another app to come about so we can ALL move away from TikTok, which has obviously been bought out by a super PAC! 😡"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is the best social media app that I have used so far, much better than Facebook and Instagram. The censorship is much less, and it's less biased and one sided like Instagram. I almost stopped using Instagram since I got this. I hope that tik Tok does not change their censorship rules."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Its a good-ish app, very entertaining relatable and useful stuff, its got cooking videos to improve meals and other things. I enjoy the ammount of music and things tgat are being created but tge upload times are a tad too long."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Keep hanging and closing abruptly. Also, heats up my ohone battery immediately I start using it, no other app on my phone heats up my battery. Thirdly, it takes a lifetime to play a video or upload a video despite having a fash internet on my phone"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Its a pretty good app and it used to be AMAZING until they took away repost comments. Repost comments were where you could repost a video that lets say was extremely relatable or targeted towards something, you could comment like "" Me if you even care "" or an initial of the person its targeted towards. I hope this gets fixed. ( ALSO EVERYTIME I HAVE HAD TIKTOK OPEN WHILE PLAYING A GAME OR SOMETHING ELSE AND I GET A NOTIFICATION AS MY NOTIFICATIONS FOR TIKTOK ARE NOT ON IT KICKS ME OUT. PLS FIX!)"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's been logging me out randomly, and now it banned my account without reason, I didn't have a chance to appeal or anything. It just banned me without reason? Every time I try to create a new account or log into an existing account, it will say, ""maximum attempts reached, try again later."" Even after I waited two weeks? Also, every time I try and create a new account, it makes it private and I can't change it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Enjoyed it for so long but recently only coming across horrible antisemetic things and no matter what it's reported as that's allowed to stay up but actual truth is removed. Pushing a very skewed agenda which I cannot support anymore plus my favorite creators are leaving the app anyway so why would I want to be surrounded by a hundred bots and dropshippers.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app keeps giving issues... can't access some effects and capcut templates though my version has been updated and linked to capcut. A solution to this should be provided

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I find this app really intertaining wich is a good thing but you can get really addicted to it and you scroll for Soo long and it's a really bad app where kids can get insulted. even TOUGHT it's 13+ alot of childrens are in this platform just by tapping the authentication button where you can say a fake age ( ex : 1980 ) I'm saying this because I was addicted to TIKTOK but thankfully I stopped and deleted TikTok for good 👍😊
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I get it someone out there wants attention no matter how. I just don't know if 8 hours of sitting at your house and doing regular every day stuff is entertaining. I got the app to see what people were talking about and I've never seen so many people who are just lost in their own worlds and are not living in reality. I don't recommend this.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Like the app. But the ads are getting out of hand. I understand it's free and they need to make money, but literally every 3rd video is an ad. It's getting ridiculous"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Wastes your time and tries to keep you in the app to fill your brain with useless boring garbage with flashy colors, popup text, and sound effects. Don't download unless you want a new addiction thats as bad as vaping."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The price for shipping on the tiktok shop is ABSOLUTELY outrageous I mean u buy two 5$ dollar items and the price is all of a sudden 30$ like? I can shop anywhere else and it's soooo much cheaper but there are things only certain creators sell on the TTshop and I just feel it truly needs to be readjusted before anybody buys anything from there.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Dude, I've granted your app all permissions, but it keeps acting like I haven't. And says I need to go into my settings to grant them, EVEN THOUGH EVERY PERMISSION IS GRANTED. WHYYYYY I just want to upload my pre made videos but I can't because it says I need to grant permission but I already have!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App won't open, says there is a bug that needs to he fixed. I updated and still won't open. I Uninstaller the reinstall and it works until I close it out then have to repeat. Dumb"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Recently I have had issues with the app crashing and freezing my phone unprovot. Even with fast connection and a New phone W/plenty of space the app with freeze everything and I mean Everything 😔😔
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,If I could stay logged in long enough to actually enjoy TIKTOK! Keeps prompting me to close app because TikTok keeps stopping. Uninstall app and re log in just for the same prompt to pop up. Might be a buggy interface 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I will raise my rating when tiktok fixes the glitch that got my live access removed. My live access got permanently uspended four days ago. I appealed it and my live access was given back to me. I went live two times in the last two days with no problems. I go to go live tonight and suddenly my access is revoked again with no chance of appealing it. The live stream that was reported was the one from four days ago. I did not get a notification about this new report and live suspension.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Definitely a risk app. The app has connnected me to people in my private life. I have told TikTok no numerous times about syncing contacts. 2 days have sent messages and they won't reply to me as to how they got the contacts. No option left but to contact authorities if they won't answer. Also, out of every social media site, TikTok has the most amount of women scammers by far, always the same, connect with you then try to get you to another site. Never had spam emails till I joined TokTok 😉"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is so awesome but the only thing is that the beauty section when you want to record it only shows face shape face smooth and eye shape I thought it will have blush and eye shadow and more but that's the only problem.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Far to many update which leads to glitches on the app. Not enough exposure for smaller creators either but plently of drama and exposure for big creators. The app isnt talked about positively like it used to and I believe is on a downwood spiral.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love the app it's amazing I love the 1 hour limit thing I have been all day in it but now I can have a break when I am watching videos. I like making videos here it's amazing I also like the tiktok live thing. For me everything in this app is just the best number one favourite app ever!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love it, it's helpful for what I need. Really funny and entertaining videos, great age restrictions and its fun posting videos and getting bigger in creating and stuff definitely recommend and the disney 100 it's so fun when trying to get the right and enough cards. Definitely Install tiktok now!"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love the whole video making. Quick and easy but only one problem. Why can't we move music into certain parts of a clip that would've been better.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Very one sided censorship. I have many comments removed for ""breaking community guidelines"" yet others say much worse, and get away with it. Also the ""appeal"" instantly comes back as their decision upheld. No contact us option, so that's it full stop. Love the app. And the shop. Pass many a time watching amusing videos. Bought stuff off the shop and all good. But the censorship aspect really annoys me. I suppose that's the trouble with being white British these days 🇬🇧"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love tiktok it is friendly. You can follow all your friends but if you have a private account on tiktok people have to ask to be your friend. It is fun. There is tiktok shop you can buy anything bows,Stanley's, kitchen supplies,fake nails,pillows. And a lot more trust me you also edit your profile and right a bio so it is a really good app and I reacamind it it's so fun. You can learn daces and sing song. To don't have to post everything you have drafts so your good if it's not postwerethe🤍❤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Don't do it, it's all ads. Everything is a ad. Everyone is selling something constantly. It's infuriating when you just want to take a break from the world and just get shoved ads in your face from every single post"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Dear support team i am Facing 2 very serious issues in TikTok 1st. App is not supporting camera selfie mirror feature which is causing issue when we record any product video camera shows whole name and text mirrored which is not readable. 2nd. I am from Pakistan and TikTok is not showing Indian and Pakistan music or songs even search is not able to search relevant songs or musics
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"At this point, I feel like yall want a low rating😭. Your idea of updates is removing the photo slide feature over and over. Give me the slide back, and I will make it 5 star!! please."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Too many creatures sitting in front of a screen begging for money. Disgusting when the apps is full of a young audience. But tiktok allows it because that is what brings in the money. Shame really, as through covid this was an amazing app to have."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Lack on support to false removal of videos, view ratio Limited to certain count , in my case 130-150 view for all videos just because I got only 10 subs. Not using any service to boost folowers . Constant asking for my contacts and to link other social media what I will never allow but it should be like switch,you want or don't, not to bother me every single time I open app. Tiktok vs Meta vs youtube,I like most YouTube that is just me. Sorry Tiktok but but you don't deserve better 😞"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've been apart of the app since it became a thing and I just love it so much. I feel like it's a grate way of showing how much I love to dance. But don't watch it to much you might end up getting addicted to the app like I am. But it's a grate app for ages 13+
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Its really helpful app but my problem is my videos are not getting many views at the same time i can`t use my tiktok with my data bundle unless i use WIFI please i will be happy if you can fix it for me so that i can be able to use my phone data bundle too ✊✊
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"App is nice, but plagued by bots. 90% of public likes on my(admittedly very unpopular) page are obvious bots with cute girl profile picture, suggestive text and scam link in the profile. And reporting them just returns with ""no violations found""."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It is a very useful apps across the world........it connect u with different people from different countries......since I started using tiktok I feel like I'm not alone. I learn what I need to learn and I enjoy together with my friends....thank.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Terrible service. I moved from another country permanently and tiktok won't let me change my region regardless of how many requests I've put forward to change my region. At first I kept getting generic responses from a staff member. When I kept asking then he says its not possible to change it. So what do I do about my followers? Just start anew? Took a while to build up my followers and they expect me to start all over again. Not really happy with the service honestly. I have two accounts. Both
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I like it to a certain extent. I'm trying to get in to one of my accounts but come to realize that they can not assist me with resetting my password or to update my phone number. Ugh! Feeling fed up like I just loss a whole account.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Horrible. App is go glitchy and never worms. Can't access my camera roll due to ""phone settings"" but all my permissions are on. Lots of bugs and app crashes all the time. YouTube shorts is way better."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is very impressive. You can find every video. Every song. Every bit of music. And everything regards to shopping. And it's Very cheap.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"First of all, For me as a users too yeah this app is good and enjoyable that even a single of minute you won't realize the time that you are over using it and addiction eat you up... Though I found peace and happiness to this app but why can't you just stay as the same I mean there's no need to update something like the account you have just log out automatically without even thinking that what if you can't open it anymore and that account is the most liking over all your accounts why❔"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Post the same video from our two different accts. One says it's fine. Other account they say they cannot recommend the video as it's flagged as ""uninteresting content"" lol. This app is completely wonky and just as bad as other social apps if you're trying to promote business related stuff."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The reason why I gave one star, cause everytime I upload a video it always gets muted, and it tells me that someone else owns the original song even though there not the original owner of the song, like really TikTok get your copyrights in order, that's the reason I don't upload any of my content on TikTok I prefer uploading my songs and content on Facebook, at least Facebook has there copyrights in order......"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Don't get me wrong tiktok is a really good app you can go on if your bored. But seriously why have so many community guidelines. I posted a comment just saying ""ew"" and it got tooken down in a couple hours, really? It was a video about food if anything they should've tooken down the video it was worse. This app seriously has to get better community guidelines and not make us slaves technically. Plus the ads are ridiculous, every 2-3 videos you get a ad about hot sauce or something in there shop."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Poor security and app glitches. The app doesn't work anymore. I can't log in. Tried to report problems with no resolutions. Accounts are always getting compromised.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It goes on a wobbler it will not open sometimes my phones topnotch my apps are upto date.. No mater what I do it just takes time to open. It's about 40% it and miss every time I use it...
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"""This promotion is unavailable."" I can't buy something off the store under the new customer pricing. So I removed the coupon, and it still says the same thing. I want to buy something and you won't let me. Either tell me correctly what is wrong or fix this trash."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's just such a fun app that has funny videos creepy videos or whatever you like to watch and if you watch part 1 of a story or something and you go to their channel it will bring you to the video you just watched which is amazing. ❤
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Can someone please explain why I get a loop of the 4 or so videos over and over for 3 or 4 times before I can see something new? It's very aggravating to swipe past something just for it to /keep coming back/ over and over. Legit my only issue with it but so aggravating.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The new update on androids S22's, 23's, and other devices SUCKS!. The constant spinning after you click to open a message to watch a video you were sent is annoying as hell."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Repeated videos from YouTube & desperately trying to advertise everything & anything...Then when you long-press and click ""Not Interested"" it'll still show you the same videos over and over again... might Uninstall soon"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Everyone should be able to go LIVE no.matterbthe amount of followers they have because I don't feel included. Especially with my hearing impairment it would be so good for me to make my own content rather than having to focus so hard on what the hosts are saying.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very nice and good experience with TikTok but there is one issue I am facing. In photo mode after selecting photos slideshow function is not working.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like TikTok there are a lot of good lives 2 watch I love watching TikTok videos people posting I have been recommending this app to family and friends there's something for all ages the only downfalls are banned words like silly ones like the word white overtaking & teenagers getting away with being rude they get away with it but the TikTok teacher gets punished instead like teenagers poking fun at other people for things that are positive. Another than that, it's a great app & I use it a lot"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Constantly get the no internet error even though the internet is working. I have to force close the app then relaunch. It happens quite a lot too.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is a great app I hope he never gets taken down like you're trying to do I started out watching funny things but then figured out that there's so much educational information on our history they lied to us about. There's things on here about natural things growing from the earth that will keep you healthy. There's a lot of information on all the poisons the controllers r putting out there for us to consume and kill us this app is what I use for my news instead of the local news stations whi

It was clear I put the audio name in the video and when I posted it again with a warning in the video and the caption, it was muted again, absolutely furious. Its clear how I put the name of the song IN the video."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is beautiful. Some of the content is crazy, but that describes other apps, as well. My favorite part is watching live content from around the globe and realizing that no matter where we are geographically, we are all of one tribe❤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's so fun to use , with interesting filters with new ones coming out every day ! You can kill time and enjoy yourself with mates or just on your own ! It also has a very welcoming community 😊... but if you type one wrong word the bubble wrap police have a cry and suspend you.. the emotions of some people, if there body was built like their emotions the wind would make them Cry. What ever happened to free speech 💬🤔??"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very entertaining! In more ways than one too. Much better than Vine. My opinion people. Keep up the good work TikTok. I'm not with all the intrusion of privacy, but it's still high quality, and the best platform out there. Please allow us to edit our messages in the future."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Your app takes so much memory. I mean, every time you send an update, you oversize the app. Is it a hint to buy a phone for tiktok and its updates? This is more than I can handle. I am thinking about deleting this app to free my phone memory."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I love tiktok but as of 2 weeks ago it will not load with my wifi at all. I've done everything possible, my connection isn't the problem. I've deleted it many times but it just won't load at all."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I mean it's mid but you can really find anything or something you need and it's here so probably one of my favorites out of the app store even though people do rhings that other people try and it kills them witch really needs to stop because the people that are doing it are experts and some kids don't understand that witch isn't ok some tiktoks are good some not anything else pretty mid but that's my thoughts.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to LOVE this app. But after over a year of use one thing remains a constant annoyance to me. Tik tok has found out i am a man. And as a result it has unleashed a horde of scammers pretending to be ""single women"". It is a legitamate non-stop onslaught of phishing links and scammers. No matter how much i report and block it is a continuous barrage. It would be nice to finally see any social media platform TRY to stop these attempts at stealing identities. But it appears they do not care."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app...it is very entertaining,very addictive and always you to be free and be yourself n finding relatable content , I didn't give it 5 stars because I'm a content creator in this app and TikTok just doesn't promote my content, I tried every strategy and I post amazing content but my account just doesn't get promoted 😕 which results in low self esteem 😔."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a fun app to enjoy but sometimes why even give us things to do with it whenever it doesn't work as in when you're adding a video some of the things don't even work will they work maybe and then when you post a video they don't even work on the video when you post them so and I don't understand most people don't understand what's more important views or likes and are so quick the band people for the silliest things without even knowing the situation so hearsay is a big problem on TikTok.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The biggest reason to NEVER use TikTok: it's owned and run by the Communist Chinese Party. I mean, think about it. Tracking in ways that can be so damaging to the United States alone. One big problem is that too much of this garbage has been let into America over the years. That's a big reason why President Trump wanted to buy it in order to remove the control of globalist communism. Don't be blind. Know where the apps originate and who owns it. I left this warning and uninstalled it right away."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,As an editor i'm disappointed. They deleted so many songs and half of my videos were muted.

Idk how many times I've clicked ""not interested in this live/creator"" and it still pops back up in my feed. Being a creator is just as bad. Random videos will get reported/taken down for vague ""community guidelines violations. Even using certain emojis is violation, just total insanity. The appeal process seems just as arbitrary. I see why many creators have the bio ""Banned at 50K""."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I had it to watch edits and now all the music for my favorite edits is gone. Also TikTok Shop feels like a scam. I ordered the viral dresser and it hasn't shown up and they are literally just stringing me along at this point. Plus they removed the search bar under followed accounts so now it is even more difficult to unfollow the banned ones as instead of searching you have to scroll through the whole list. They are also shadow banning and flat out banning a bunch of content creators for nothing

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The follow button doesn't work, and the app is generally slow and filled with bugs. The fact that videos automatically resume when the app is reopened is incredibly frustrating. This isn't a feature that should exist, and an option to stop this from happening would improve the app."

Some of my issues: Notification are a mess, sometimes i get them sometimes i don't. The Inbox screen is also a mess, loading is extremely slow, the clear display feature is hit & miss idk how it works anymore. Overall this app probably needs a rewrite from the ground up because of how slow and unresponsive it is Ps : add dark mode if you like us android users"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is weird. I downloaded this app for some rewards for a game app that I have been playing for like 3 or 4 months now. And tiktok was one of the choices. And Everytime, I'm trying to link something to tiktok; it keeps reloading back to link account to tiktok or another app that, I use every now and again. Getting the codes from either by text or email tiktok keeps going backwards instead of going forward."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,DO NOT INSTALL THIS APP! It was the worst decision I have EVER made. Addiction is easy and it will rot your brain

And in order to remove that audio, you have to add the private account to remove the audio. I have 3 audios that was made by private accounts that I found so far and I can't remove them. Besides that, I don't have any other problems with it. I would also say the guidelines as well but it hasn't been a problem since last year."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok grew on me! I was reluctant to get on, but I'm finding far more freedom on this app that the other social media apps do not have. The other Nazi apps like FB are out of control with their censorship and controls. I feel like I'm in prison those apps. Tiktok allows for more freedom of expression and it reaches more people than your same 10 friends on FB!"

I've tested this numerous times while gaming and just overall use of my devices. I have a z fold 5 and it shouldnt lag or slow down even the slightest. Everytime I have tiktok on my device it's slowing it down uploading snd downloading data it shouldn't be doing. This app should be banned across NA and other regions.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the app, but for some reason. It's stopping me from reposting. And I would love for tik tok to get back to me and make my account better by letting me repost."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I would give it five stars if it wasn't for the fact that apparently you're only allowed to follow so many people before it prevents you from following more! Very annoying 😞 Also I wish the algorithm was a little better.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm just leaving this to complain that the latest update has left me unable to follow anyone. Other than that the app is what it is and will always continue to be, a highly viable time passer. Edit: Found out apparently shadow bans are real and THAT'S what I'm experiencing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"definitely below one star now. tiktok keeps updating and changing things that were not issues in the first place. in fact, the changes are worse and make the app harder to use and not as enjoyable. for example, slideshows. you can no longer pause them. when you try, it just mutes the audio and opens the comments. but if you want it on mute without the comments, you can't have that. if you try to go back to the slideshow with the audio muted, it automatically unmutes. it sucks honestly."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I appreciate tic toc because they're not like facebook. It's educational inspirational and encouraging. I like that they allow nudity, but that part shouldn't be readily available for kids. I was a tad reluctant in signing up for T. T. but when I did, I was happy that I did. Hopefully T. T. don't sell our personal information like facebook illegally did, because they're watching T. T. closely. I appreciate T. T."

Recently though, the app has just completely stopped when I try opening tiktoks I've been tagged in. I tried going into my settings to report the problem via TikTok, but the app completely stops whenever I open my settings as well. I've tried updating it, uninstalling it & installing it again, no changes. Please help!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app is too slow crashes multiple times it needs a performance update please fix
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like this app! It's pretty easy to navigate and upload content. However, I have filtered keywords to keep some content I don't prefer. They don't work for lives. Every time I accidentally click on the live button (my fault), the same lives show up, but they are specifically the key words I filtered. I continue to press ""not interested,"" but they constantly show up. It's a slight inconvenience."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"[EDITED REVIEW] so, I got this a while back, and at first I loved it, but now that I've had time to have it, there are a few things I wanna point out. It tends to take up a lot of space, and glitch out from time to time. I can't scroll two videos without an ad, and they continuously ""update"" it, in which they'll take away ALL features, before giving them back, with MAYBE one or two adjustments. In all, it's an okay app, and fun, but beware of the ads and glitches. ✌️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It was good at first but after I updated it, it kicked me out and lagged. I tried resetting my phone and that didn't work. I had to uninstall the app and re-install it and I lost all 50+ of my drafts. Totally disappointed. What about this update is so big that it makes tiktok glitch. I'm not the only one who complained about this so I think it should definitely be sorted out immediately 😒"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Fun, but incredibly unstable. TikTok is basically any other social media app, depending on what accounts you follow and interact with, you will have a lot or little to no fun. The problem comes with updates, every time it does so, it stops working properly, crashes and never opens. I always have to uninstall the App and reinstall it, which is... Annoying. I hope you can figure out what may be causing this error, and fix it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"When the app actually works, it's great. Unfortunately, more often than not it fails to connect to your WiFi even when you clearly are. Even after forcing several stops, disconnecting and reconnecting to the WiFi or clearing the cache, it will often be ""disconnected."" If this issue is fixed, it's a great app. Until then, it's just going to be an app that doesn't work half the time"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I rated this 5 stars back in 2021 now it is getting 4 stars as UMG sounds are getting removed. Like isn't the point of the app is to listen to music? How will I survive? 😭
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"As a social media app- it does its job, however there are some large problems with the app. Two most glaring (as a non creator) is that audio is not level between videos (so you have to constantly change your volume) and that the search function is just garbage. You should be able to look at a sound and search a user who used the sound, or only duets to the sound... ect. When switching phones under the same account I lost about 90% of my liked videos and the people I was following. Okay app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Lately, I've been getting an in-app pop-up asking me to enable mobile push notifications. It pops up often, sometimes twice on the same video. Always many times per visit. There's no way to disable the pop-up. When I turned on just 1 type of push notification, it still would appear & ask me to turn on ALL THE OTHER notifications. Unpleasant user experience. Very poor. Not recommended. Plus, the moderation of inappropriate content is sorely lacking."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Dear TikTok, I saw the latest update was around July 20th. This is the same time period my drafts started acting funny. I want to make you aware of this bug. I can't access drafts. It appears to be processing, not loading them. I can select them (or something), but I don't see what I am selecting, as the screen is blank. I thought I was able to delete them all, to start over, but it appears something is still holding the space. I am concerned bc all new drafts, saved, also end up this way."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best app TikTok. Very easy to make video with sound and effect when you tried to tie a sound to video. TikTok had updated the generated captions which is really great. But I don't like it because blocking most of the videos but even if turn the setting off the captain will still shown up. It is very annoying, I hope they fix the problem immediately. And my video ever not going to foryou so please fix this problem. Thanks for ever and never."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm being asked to update the app whenever I open it on my phone, but once I'm redirected to the playstore there's no update button. Just a request to install the app on more devices... weird. I tried to uninstall the app and then reinstall it. Now I can not download the app at all. Looks like the update wiped out many users... Otherwise (when able to use) it's a great app. Very entertaining. Definitely a time thief."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Hi, so ive had this app since 2018 when it first switched to tiktok and it's one of my favorite apps however theres a few things that can and should be fixed 1 there should be a way to hide/close the caption when you watch the video like adding a pull up caption on the bottom 2 there should be a box that appears every time you try and refresh asking ""are you sure you want to refresh [yes] [no] "" 3 add a watched/viewed place so that I can see videos I liked but forgot to save. Thanks :)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a dicey app for me. On one hand, it's a marvelous app, with relatable and accurately recommended videos, but then it also brings things that I do not find relevant or interesting whatsoever. This is something I have come across quite often, and while not everything can be perfect, it has really took away from the experience. I hope its algorith improves, in all else, it is a great app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"it's pretty cool, but i have lots of issues trying to edit a video. the text wont move from the center and i cant delete it, the search function for stickers is stuck on the results from the first time i used it, and i can't delete footage without discarding the whole video. no problems when viewing/interacting with other users and other user's videos."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really like the app,its cool how you can make videos of people making dances and lip synching to songs. But my problem is that I cant enjoy that without having to delete everything on my phone, even after I do, I have no storage at all, I had to delete this and it took up 10% of my space. I would definitely download this again if the amount of storage it takes up went down"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoy this app. Have for a couple of years now, but the last few weeks, my follow page is gone, I only have a for you page, and I hate it! I would like to see the my following page come back for more than an hour after uninstalling and reinstalling the app. This happened when he shop page appeared at the bottom of the app. Please fix this! Bring back my following page, and I could care less about the shops, I can save videos with shops I'm interested in."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I legit enjoy this app, and it is generally a mental break from the stress of Facebook. One challenge I'm having is with uploading my videos - for some reason, the option to add closed captioning is gone, and doesn't work for me, which sucks. I can't find where it is even listed as a feature to turn on and off. Also, my only other gripe is the amount of racists and crazies allowed to proliferate on this app. It takes away from my enjoyment. Otherwise, I love the way it allows people to connect."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is good to share fun things, however recently I have realized a change in the algorithm. I now get a lot of toxic videos such as videos promoting eating disorders and fake chain mail junk. I have recently taken a break from tiktok, and I feel free. I feel a lot more confident, I don't spend as much time on my phone now, and I feel much less stressed and sad. This app is ok, as long as of they can get rid of all of this toxic content."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing .If you want to get more people watching until the end of the video, you can include captions that say things like 'wait for it' or keep watching'. you can also use captions to explain what's happening in the video to people who are watching Tiktok without sound. I was finally ready to do a video, the 10minoption is gon. I have this off for a Reason. There's been a few different examples of this the pop -up is the most frequent. It changes your settings."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like the app, I think it's entertaining and easy to use. My biggest complaint are the static buttons that area visible while scrolling, especially the white ones (+, like, share,...). They got burned into my last phone screen, so now I'm afraid to use TikTok on my new device. They should definitely adjust the home screen so this isn't a problem."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a great rabbit hole to stumble down. This has kept me entertained at the most inappropriate times! Lately there has been an issue with audio files playing ontop of other audio. When I switch from one to to another, especially if I go from live to 'for you' I will hear the audio from the first reel as well as see and hear the second reel. I can't seem to find help for this issue?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'll start by saying, I love TikTok. Never had issues with it, but within this last week or so I can't even get through one video without it freezing, then I get the pop-up that the app isn't responding. It freezes any time I try to do anything on the app lately. Even just liking a video makes it freeze. I've never had this issue before so I don't know why now all of a sudden it's messing up. It's not my wifi or my phone."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The idea of the app is great, but execution not so much. Glitchy. Frequently app restarts while in the middle of viewing things, and no history to get back to things it cuts you off in the middle of. FYP refreshes randomly while viewing videos, and you can't get back to what you were viewing. Doesn't work well with android for recording.. glitchy, freezes, doesn't save drafts. Obviously made for Iphone and little to no care for other users. Disappointing overall. Developers show some effort pls"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've spent more time on this app than I should, but it makes it easy to find content you love, learn new things, and the algorithm pick up on stuff you like (based on interaction and watchtime) and helps you to find more videos like it. it's even allowed me to keep in contact with old friends that don't live close anymore, and it's easy to prevent from seeing content you don't like."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is good. The problem is that it is causing burn in in my screen. When im using other apps, i can see for you letters, the plus icon, home icon embedded on the screen which is causing a lot of viewing issues. Its a shame that it has not been fixed since the issue on amoled devices in 2021. Because of this i had to get the screen changed just because if an app!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Never experienced problems with this app, and how it works highly depends on your phone model. My last phone ran the app fine, however if storage was low, it could crash. With my current phone, I can't film like I used to because the back camera can't focus while in the app, but overall I enjoy the app. I think there's content for everyone on TikTok and I genuiely have fun on here. My one thing is that I'd love to be able to upload audios so I can use my own sounds without sperate video software"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is very difficult to use. They got rid of the powers Change the speed to 10X and crop frames. You try to a Voiceover, but you don't know how long it takes. By the time you've recorded the sounds... but after you're done Once the recording is done, you can't go back and trim the video Adequate your words without erasing The whole thing and restart. You can't just upload Either your own audio track. In this it is almost useless. point And my videos are not even liked my video Almasgill47"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"If I don't pay for my videos to get views. They simply won't. Tiktok should promote small accounts more, in my opinion. But I do like it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app, I met most of my close friends through this platform. Great structure, unique establishment, and good vibes all around. Although, whenever I decide to watch someone's live, it always glitches for me. Now, I'm not sure if it's just my android (being an android), or if the app is having malfunction issues. (Anyone having this problem??)"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There's an ugly zoom in every of the videos that appear on my FYP or in general, which means the videos are halfcut and I can't appreciate them entirely, it looks terrible. It's been months and I haven't been able to watch a tiktok properly on the app because of it. I can't get rid of the zoom, it's not something I can fix by just pinching the screen with two fingers; I've tried everything, deleting the data, uninstalling and installing again and nothing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I try to make a video, but the ""finished product"" is frozen/it starts halfway through the video. it ruins my videos, and they dont make sense after. please fix this. Also, when trying to make a caption, everytime I delete a letter or word it deletes some other word or letter. bad app. Another thing: Whenever I try to make an original sound, it sounds really messed up and its all high pitched and sireny."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This used to be fine, but lately it's crashing all the time. I open the app, it looks normal, then it refreshes and the videos are zoomed in, i can't search, the font gets huge, i can't look at profiles, and it won't let me close the app - i have to try to swipe it away several times. It's unusable at this point. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, I've cleared the cache, I've cleared the storage - i give up. Until there's a new version to try, i won't be using TikTok."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's good and fun. But I think it should have an option to see which videos other users have been tagged on, and when users' videos have been used to make duets by others. Also, when I search videos by hashtags or songs, it'd be nice to be able to filter the results in ways such as upload time. Otherwise I keep seeing the same results over and over."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Look, I love this app to death, it's great for posting cosplay videos but I've been having some really aggravating problems. I have a samsung, and whenever I flip the camera to take a video of a picture, the camera is blurry and you have to click the screen in order for it not to be blurry, but it will last a couple seconds. For iPhone users, their cameras don't need to adjust. When I'm on my normal camera, it's fine and doesn't have to adjust like that. Can you please fix this?? Make it fair?!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Tik tok has been interesting. However the tools need to be enhanced. If I go to load a photo and choose a song from the app, it will not play the song 4 more than 15 sec. This happens every time.. It doesn't matter if I choose 1,3 or a 10 min. upload. If the song selected is for 1 minute, the app only allows 15 sec. Cust service in the app is an issue. To find prev messages from cust serv.to respond to is a problem. You're forced to reach out again, start over & repeat your inquiry."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The concept is great but the way its being handled is horrible. It takes so long for the videos to load, really easy to accidently refresh the page when in the middle of the video (literally an upwards swipe) and your overwhelmed with controls and options which makes it really hard to use them and understand them, are just some of the issues I've been encountering on a daily basis on tik tok."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app and it's really fun to watch during my free time. Sometimes I even meet online friends which have the same interest as me! There are some things I wish could be added 1. A way to edit your video after posting, because I have always had last minute changes and have to repost the whole thing 2. Extend the time limit. I would like for there to be a 3min video so I don't have to wait for part twos, or need to break up videos Either then that this is an amazing app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is amazing .however did have come glitches happen while using the app. For example when you press the button to record a video with a sound the sound played while the camera is just stock in a position .and no. On the camera app this has never happened. This glitch has been occurring for about 1 month and a half. Sometimes it works but not often. I herded ever record video anyway but i do however post edited. And it works just fine. So it doesn't really brother me that.........❤️❤️😍
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't like that Tik Tok advertises so much and it interferes with a lot of things I'm trying to get or do on my pages. For instance, when I'm in Remini photo site, Tik Tok practically takes over and it takes three times the amount of time for my photos to finish. I wish I could get it OFF completely. I think it's very inconsiderate for Tik Tok to just up and block what your trying to see, get, or who you're trying to communicate with!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Look man, the app is great, but when I scroll and like, favorite, or whatever on the app for not even an hour, and I get the ""you're tapping too fast, take a break"" message pops up and persists for a full 24 hour day, come on man, that's ridiculous. Even more so when you get to know that I take breaks, several hours long each time to prevent this, and it still happens. Godsend though, the ""you've been on a while, go outside"" message has since stopped. Thank you. A^^^^^^ 1 person found this help"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's a good app. However if I have it on my phone for some reason my volume acts odd and starts turning itself down. It literally started when I put the app on my phone and stopped when I removed it. I tested it multiple times. And it happens when I am using different apps. Like I will listen to YouTube and the volume will lower itself. Again never did it before downloading the app and it stopped as soon as I removed the app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Sick of the constant updates and changes to the UI. I've never seen any other social media app make this many changes in such a short amount of time. And if the updates actually made sense, and we're good it wouldn't be a problem. But no, they suck, if it's not broken then don't fix it. Also, with the amount of updates they churn out, you would think the Android version would be on par but it's STILL missing a lot of key features."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app could be great, it's good for right now, but please do something to make it less laggy. The lag is the 100% worst part of this whole operation. Maybe add something so people can choose the quality and maybe swipe to make all of the icons, descriptions, and things similar to that so it can look more like if you downloaded the videos. This is not hate, but more of things to make tik toc more appealing and for hopes that these problems may get corrected. Tlhank you for the consideration."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"As of late, all my friends on tiktok accounts stop showing up, they'll have no problem however their account for me says ""only friends can send messages"". I've ran into this exact problem twice now and in order to fix it, I have to uninstall and reinstall the app. I'm generally sick of this because I have to go through a lot of loops to simply send and respond messages. I hope this won't be a problem in the near future."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The biggest problem for me is that I sometimes I have to delete this app and then reinstall it. But see when I do so, all my drafts are gone. Some of them were really important and I was waiting for the right time to finish them up and post them. But instead they all get deleted. For example, if I am wanting to post a video that has a transition from my old room to my new room but I have not moved *yet*, then how am I suppose to do it if I have to reinstall it because of problems that keep on happening? Please fix this problem ASAP."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am also experiencing the same problem as some other users and have submitted a report a few days ago and have heard NOTHING back. When I go to use a sound, I can hear the sound just fine playing a video, but when I go to record, there is no sound. But if I post the video, the sound plays. This error makes it IMPOSSIBLE to sync up to the sound and produce any quality content. Tiktok, please listen to your users and address this issue now."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a good app I've had TikTok for pretty lang, but recently there was another update (which is normal). TikTok had update the generated captions which is actually really great! But not for me, i don't like the captains on my screen blocking most of the video. I know how to take the captains off but even if i turn the setting off, the captains will still show up. This is Very annoying. hope they fix the problem"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's fine. But poorly optimised for android devices. Examples include, but not limited to, the lack of voice filters as seen on Apple devices, inconsistent frame rate when using the camera and, not exclusively to android, the UI could be better functionality wise. Overall, it does the job, but with some flaws which inhibits android users to have a better experience."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is good overall. I just have a suggestion: take a page from Instagram's book and add a collections feature for saved videos, audios, filters, etc. Thanks! Update: I've recently been experiencing issues with videos where they'd glitch or randomly stop playing for no reason. I don't know what caused it, but it never happened before last night. person found this helpful"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is great! So many tiktokers, videos, and the sounds/music?! Oh my gosh, they make me just wanna jump out of bed and dance! I hum them all the time around the house, but I have one note. Some people are deaf and need subtitles. They aren't added in all the videos, only some. It would be nice if we could have a switch for subtitles. Other than the subtitles everything is great to me! This app brightens my day! Keep it up tiktok!💕"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Close to perfect, as a regular viewer it's perfect, of you want videos and a good background algorithm that gives you the content you want, this is the app for you. As a content creator, I feel that there is a learning curve for usage of the app that should really have some kind of inbuilt manual for ease of use. Also, certain features seem to be missing on the android version, such as being able to post video-comments."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The songs are nice, but all sound like a broken record. For those old enough to remember the old lp records, sounds like a bad scratch. For those who are young, a pause with words missing. I was only looking for a ringtone of a particular song, not a lot of personal videos, so this is of no use to me with the song being chopped to pieces."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"PHOTOSENSITIVE PEOPLE: RUN Worst social media I've tried. The app itself is designed to overstimulate, confuse, and exploit. Despite how obvious this is, many artists need to be on it to keep up with engagement. It's gotten to the point that I finally tried it again, only to find that a current trend is flickering light videos that are literally painful for me to look at. I tried muting this trend, which appears to have no effect at all. Another one came up within minutes."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This a platform for all to show ur hidden talent. I like it. But some features should be changed. 1. video play one after another automatically 2. video should be arranged according to no. of likes. Always highest likes video in the first place. 3. ur unseen video should appear in first . After that seen video start. u can go direct to the list of seen video with the help of other button.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Generally, a well thought out app. With plenty of predecessors' fails to structure itself from. Lots of ads, tho, and the algorithm for your personalized viewing experience is a bit too quick on the uptake sometimes. However, the adds are easily skipped and more on the side of fairly entertaining than most similar apps. Also, seems pretty free-speech oriented. Which is always great to see."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm giving tiktok a 4 stars because it is literally the only app I use all day every day and it is super reliable. it has basically changed my life. one thing though, I have updated it as much as there is to update, and I still cannot do the photo swipe feature. it just comes up with a video and I want it to make it so ypu can swipe through photos. I see other people doing tutorials and I don't have any of the features they do. I also don't have story mode anymore. I only have camera. pls fix it"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I am going to give you a three. Everyone has the ""Text-To-Speech"" except for me. Before you think it's the one that says your own text for you, it isn't that. It's the overlapping speech voice. I have not a clue why this is happening, but I suggest you get it fixed. Also all the updates get to IOS phones before Android which is phoneist. Otherwise your app is magnificent! Thank you."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've liked it a lot so far, but I got some weird audio syncing issues with one of the videos I was editing. Like I recorded something and the audio was delayed by at LEAST 3 seconds. I thought ""No problem! I'll just cut the clip and reshoot it."" But when I cut the clip, it cut the audio for the ENTIRE video. It was frustrating because now that tiktok is in Limbo because there's no way to troubleshoot IN the app. I wish it let us edit a bit more than the options you already have. Contact me Dev!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The algorithm was once so beautiful..... Now not so much. My fyp is now just 4 types of videos: clips of movies or shows split screen with gameplay, artists promoting their music/craft, meandering storytimes complaining about something, or standup comedy clips (also being promoted). The only reason I see anything enjoyable is that I built a good 'following' page in the before times."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Short cute videos, plenty of adorable animals, and some interesting facts and people. Some of them do get repetitive like the cliche girl with waist length hair in booty shorts doing the same dance everyone else is doing. WAYYYY too many trends. That's why I'm glad there's a ""for you"" page so it just shows you stuff similar to what you like instead of just showing you everything."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app used to be great with a lot of really interesting high quality videos showing all kinds of art, talents, travel & more. Now it's full of people posting blurry, bad & banal ""story times"", facts & repetitive copycats. Definitely disappointed with the lack of originality, effort & experience. Do not waste your time unless you truly want to walk away with worse than nothing: boredom!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I would love to see more anime-type effects on there for superheroes, Dragon Ball Anime, etc. It's a great app. Also, the ability to change whether or not you have the TikTok logo on there floating around your videos would be great. You can leave the ending part alone. Besides that, it's a great app. Oh, one more thing. Bring back the ability to speed up or slow down the music."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing , however I did have some glitches happen while using the app . For example , when you press the button to record a video with a sound , the sound plays while the camera is just stuck in a position , and no , on the camera app this has never happend . This glitch has been occurring for about 1 month and a half . Sometimes it works but not often . I hardly ever record videos anyways , but I do however post edits , and it works just fine , so it doesn't really bother me that"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"For the past three days... I got logged out of my former account, I couldn't get it back and I opened a new one. Now I get logged out everytime and I can't follow more than 16 people,my fyp is disorganized everytime. The whole app is very buggy for real and it's getting annoying. I can't save videos, I can't share, I send or receive messages and videos. It's becoming really annoying. Worst of all, the search bar is always telling me ""no internet connection"". There are just so many bugs. Pleasee."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"[EDITED REVIEW] so, I got this a while back, and at first I loved it, but now that I've had time to have it, there are a few things I wanna point out. It tends to take up a lot of space, and glitch out from time to time. I can't scroll two videos without an ad, and they continuously ""update"" it, in which they'll take away ALL features, before giving them back, with MAYBE one or two adjustments. In all, it's an okay app, and fun, but beware of the ads and glitches. 💪✌️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app itself is wonderful, but this newest update made it so that when coming across a slideshow (photo mode) and you pause it, it causes the comments to scroll up. I preferred it the way they had it before (when you paused it, you could still look through the photos but not hear the sound and without the bio and comments taking up the screen.)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"A little difficult to get the hang of if you want to make videos, but this app makes for an extremely good time sink. I just wish that they'd manufacture a solution to the audio lag that happens when you record a duet w someone while wearing bluetooth earbuds. It makes magical musical duets really difficult, especially with a phone that doesn't have an aux port to plug wired headphones into to help remove the lag."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"NO ADS! I never wanted to use TiKToK and always watched on Facebook. The ads on Facebook have become so bad, I decided to get the TT app. The only add I encounter is when I first open it and I can skip right away, or the occasional ad video that I can CHOOSE to scroll on by whenever if I so choose. I know the average American can be easily manipulated but if I see an ad and it MAKES me watch it, I can guarantee I will never use or buy that product. Either way, don't EVER change."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is amazing. The the two refresh buttons are really annoying. I can't tell you how many amazing video's I have skipped because I accidentally pressed one of the refresh buttons. Also, why is there no auto-scroll option? Sometimes I just want to watch tiktoks hands-free (when it's cold, while eating) but i can't because I have to scroll every few seconds, please fix that."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok used to work pretty well for me. But, I'm suddenly having all kinds of issues. The ""not interested"", ""hide videos by this user"", and ""hide videos with this sound"" buttons no longer work. The same videos will continue to show up over and over, forcing me to block to user in order to stop seeing their content. In general, the app is becoming very buggy. Audio no longer syncs with videos, it has trouble loading comments, etc. It's incredibly frustrating"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Not bad theres a lot of ads and it wont let me open the app! Its telling me to update it which i did but it still wont work🙄 but i do like the rest. So tiktok, fix it!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Its a great app, i am literally addicited. Although i would say it requires a few more updates. Like having and option to see every one that duets a video. And being able to put your favorites in different folders to find videos easier. Also it should have an option like ""are you sure you want to refresh?"" Because i always refresh by accident and lose the video i was watching."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is pretty good nothing wrong with it, but I still have many features and updates that didn't show but my friends features came in early.please fix this and add new features. I sent multiple requests and emails and never replied. user is monsterzzz just add the features. Everything nothing new just like the slideshow and full screen and auto scroll I don't have any of them."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Unresponsive, won't pause. It let me pause one video, otherwise it just wouldn't respond while a video is playing. Then it jumps to another annoying video while I'm still trying to pause the first one. I'm not a boomer, just an impatient millennial, but I like to have more control over my media. Maybe I'll try again later to see if it's better."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm digging the favorites menu, but I'd love for it to be a playlist situation, i.e. you can select to make it private, friends only, or public, so people can see what you're adding to each playlist, and it would be cool if I could add a video to more than one favorite folder. It also makes very little sense that you can only message people if they follow you and you follow them, just give us a chance to reject or accept the message like messenger does instead pls??"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like the app in general. But there are 2 main things that bug me the most. The ads are very annoying, although I already got used to deal with ads on social media over the years, Tik Tok doesn't really seem to recognize my preferences, so when it shows me ads with ppl dancing or whatever, it's very annoying. And the other thing that I don't like is that they go through my contacts and messaging other ppl through the app is not private, meaning that they can see the messages I send my friends."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app isn't bad, I enjoy using the audios for edits and cosplay but really when it comes to the management aspect it's difficult. Accidently posted a draft? Rip put it on private and reshoot, you've lost it. Typo in the caption? You can't edit it, just repost it. Need support? Non existent, well appeal taken down videos but we won't put them back up There's a lot of things that need to be fixed before this app can truly be what it's capable of being but honestly I'm not too hopeful 2 ☆"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I'll give you 5star when you give us the Search🔍 for music function. I'm wasting a lot of time by scrolling up and down when browsing music to attach on the video from my phone. Instead of just typing the name of the song. The search function is only available when you adding music from online and it's not available when you adding music from the local storage. Thx
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"i enjoy this app and the people on it; however, there are some faults. after scrolling for a while, there is a glitch where the whole screen turns white so i have to close the app and open it again to restore it. the messaging function is also very bad. i wish i could delete messages, send pictures, and see if the person i sent messages to has seen them via read receipts. it would be very nice if you would fix these. thank you."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app like so many others tries it's best to allow for short media content creation and viewing. It excels honestly in both regards to other comparable apps. The UI for content creation is smooth and easy to learn while allowing for complexity. While the viewing send to be widely dispersed and highly discoverable. The reason I give 4 starts is because I think there is more that can be improved upon although being far ahead.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's OK but I don't like that they took my slide option away.and they suspended my account for no reason and won't let me know why. this is a huge let down.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Ever since the most recent update, I've been having trouble with duets. Either the audio of the video I'm dueting is completely out of sync or it starts out normal but, when I press the record button again, there is a slight delay. I've tried everything. I've tried restarting my device, uninstalling the app and then reinstalling it, and updating, none of which has worked. I reported it to the help center but they haven't even gotten back to me."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Hi tiktok. I'm so frustrated with this buggy app. Not sure if it's just me but for a while now I've been experiencing repetitive bugs such as mentions in comments not going through to the user, notifications not going through to me, and my friend being unable to follow me meaning I am unable to send videos to them. It is unfortunate that this glitch is happening and honestly I request this to be fixed at once. I've deleted the app multiple times, force stopped it and yet nothing has fixed it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love the app. Although there are problems that are frustrating. In July, I switched from an IPhone 8+ to a Samsung s20. Even with the older version IPhone, it still has more options than my newer Samsung. The duets don't have a mic option for me to use my own sound because its said they pick and choose who they send thag out too, and some of the filters don't work correctly. I've messaged and i hope to get some answers. Also, I've already reported a problem twice about a week ago."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I get to laughfs out and learn from the app, very nice to have the experience then, I can share the videos if I like the video enough and share with people that take similar interests, thank you tic tok.I love this app. so much and recommend it to all."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"TikTok is actually a pretty good app, I like to use it for motivation and ideas. However, there should be an option to turn off lives showing up on your for you page. Also, it won't let me delete or change the names of my favorited collections. Other people have also been saying that they can't even use the collection feature. I also keep getting kicked off the app and it won't let me back in unless I restart my phone."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really like TikTok!! It's editing features are top notch, and I like how easy it is just to open the app and use it! Though there is only one problem: It takes lots of data and it downloads slow. It was at sixteen percent and the next minute, it stays at 88%. Overall, the app is still enjoyable and fun. I look forward to the new updates."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is great for watching really entertaining videos with it's visually appealing and easy to understand interface. However, this afternoon I was disturbed to find out that it had used up 1.47 GB of mobile data (3/4 of my total available data) in less than a month, just in the background - not even while I was using the app. I have since disabled it's ability to do that but the fact that it is using so much data while the app is closed is frankly disturbing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It can be a fun app once you get past all the stupid stuff you don't want to see. But my main problem is the entire app is based on using audios that are provided and yet when you attach the audio to give them credit it doesn't allow it (it removes it) in a recent update. Then my video I worked hard on is processing for hours. Sometimes never to be posted. I put the credit in the comments too and it won't allow you to pin comments. PLEASE bring back pinned comments. Thanks so much. 🙏🏻
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's my new addiction.... I like it and there are people on there I have met that are just amazing. It does take up alot of space on my phone though. It is more of my phone issue over the app issue there though. I also dont have duet layouts and I am not entirely sure why. I would like to be able to search through my likes videos with a search bar, cause it's sometimes hard to find a specific video I was talking about and that would narrow it a bit. But other then that I really enjoy the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have issueS that prevent me from using the app for its intended purpose. I have attempted to submit a complaint MULTIPLE times, but every time I hit submit, it says I have no network connection. So now I have completely failed at everything TikTok, and have nowhere to go but here. I have a newer phone and reliable WiFi. I have photos of my complaints (including WiFi and cellular at working) and nowhere to send them. 2 stars is very generous at this point."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I never ever use this type of a brilliant social network application in my life... It was a awesome app you launched, real great👍🏻 thanking you for asking me my rewiew🙏"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is most intertaining and so many interesting . also aknowledging in short videos .
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Sucked. The app wouldn't stay on for more than 2 seconds, then crashed to the home screen. Eventually, on my third try, it crashed my phone completely and I had to restart it. It seems you need to have a really nice fancy phone for it to actually work, as some of the other people describing my problem also have low quality, cheaper phones."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The only thing bad so far. The app will delete a video you were half way though finishing, while working on it. No idea if it's a bug or my phone. But it gets irritating sometimes. Notice it happens less with better phones. Still fun, still a great place to post interesting things. Could do with less social media in my life, but so can everyone. Best of luck to people working on this app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Fantastic app! It helps so many people to out content, it's very easy to make a nice video. There is so much content on everything and anything it's amazing! The only two things that stop me to put a 5 ⭐: _ If a video is longer than the maximum length and it's in multiple parts, you waste so much time scrolling through the user upload to find the next part! Annoying, it should take you straight to the video you watched in their profile. _ The ""tik tok trap"" spend hours on it..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Audio bleeds over from one video to the next. There is almost always a error message in the middle of the screen that says ""sorry, this video isn't available"" even though the video is playing. The clear mode is not nearly as smooth as the previous version. On the older version if you selected it on the video you were watching you would instantly get the clear mode on it. It doesn't happen on this latest version. The next video will be clear and the clear mode stays on. Not happy with this."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok really needs to learn how to make filters available to all devices. If it can download it, it could be able to have all access. Also, when I make a video now, the end of the audio is cut off or can't be recorded if I try to make a cut there, and the sound when recording is always slowed and pitched down. I have a samsung S10. Pretty new, pretty good. There's no reason this should be happening. The social aspect if this is great, but the creator aspect of this is terrible......"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"pretty good app. the algorithm could be better, i sometimes get suggested videos that are no where near what kind of content i usually interact with. pretty simple to use. very addicting, and that can make it difficult to stop watching/making videos. also, the app is much worse for androids, for example camera quality. overall, i enjoy tiktok besides the negatives i talked about."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have been using this app alot until I discovered that the app opened on its own. Whenever I go to sleep i remove every app from the phone tab. When I woke up I used to see tiktok opened. I think this app is spying on people. Another thing is that when swiping up to see the opened apps, tiktok wasn't there. Why? Maybe because they don't want you to see that it opens by itself, without you clicking it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Takes forever to load and watching live feeds are always a problem because they freeze too much! Every time that I make a comment on a live the app freezes. It won't let me tap and like the video without kicking me out of the room! I'm trying to watch a live show now and it just keeps buffering. It buffers way too much and for too long!!! IT'S IRRITATING!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I had an email that said I had 3 new contacts, tik tok made me download the app just to find out that I did not have any notifications or contacts. This app is for useless people. I immediately Uninstaller the app because Google already knows everything and tik tok is for 5 year Olds who only care about themselves."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I would have given it even less than 1 star. in fact for you there should be a negative rating system. in beginning I was liking it, but then. I used the inbuilt messaging software to communicate with my friends. and that has a lot of bugs, why dont you fix them! it has some keywords if those words are there in the text then the text does not appear on the friends screen. and the messages are received after so long. that messaging experience ruined the whole fun of using this app!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's the TikToks! Massive short attention theater at scale. Consumption is great of that's all you're here for, but for creators editing capabilities are clumsy and limiting. They've improved but still it would be nice if you could recut to music better being able to split like video, importing 1080+ clip would be awesome, basics like cropping and resizing, speed ramping (yes you can slow mo). Overall I tend to edit outside the app due to all the limitations which is frustrating."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Tik Tok is a fantastic app for a lot of things. Unfortunately there are a lot of people that try to cause problems with it especially racist individuals and the United States government. But whatever app they make after this we will definitely look forward to using, it's an app that definitely helps an individual have a voice whether it's a good voice or bad voice is to be determined."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Nvidia Shield doesn't allow for any type of video engagement. No ability to move the video forward, or backwards. No ability for comments (which should be possible with a Bluetooth keyboard, as the Nvidia Shield does work with Bluetooth accessories). Also the audio/video becoming unsynchronized is incredibly annoying. Mostly just disappointed that I can't rewind for fast forward for the bits of video that are difficult to hear, or contain information I'd like to write down (like book titles)."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Can't access my inbox from Chromebook, which is why I installed it. Not only is it missing that feature, but this build of the app is actually LESS functional than the existing web interface. What's even the point? Literally only two buttons: home and discover. I can't even upload like I can from web. Also it crashes every time I try playing a video. Response: if I could keep the app running for longer than three seconds before it starts autoplaying a video and crashes, I might be able to. :P"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This app is very entertaining. Sometimes there may be some inapropriete content for certain ages. I've also recently had a problem while scrolling through tiktok a video freezes and the previous audio plays but I just swipe up and down then a couple minutes later it happens again I'm not sure what the reason is since everything has been just fine until this point.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's not very easy to find the popular audio in order to use it, you can only find music when searching in the ""sounds"" unless you know the name of the exact audio you need (all the voiceovers, for example) Then there's the matter of the caption/hashtag/profile button/comment button/share button all sitting on top of the video. They can't be hidden which makes videos with text inside them really inconvenient to watch because you're trying to be able to read the words through obstructions."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The only small improvement I can really think of is when I swipe over or click on a tiktoker's profile to watch more of their videos (cause they're in parts usually put together in order to make up one huge clip), I think it would be cool if you could find a way to give an option to go to that specific video. Like if swiping left takes me to that video on their page, but clicking their profile button takes me to their main page."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"the algorithm used to be very accurate, but after the last few updates the ""Not Interested"" mechanic doesn't seem to work anymore, and you can only block up to 100 video tags that barely exclude anything that you can't ignore. This has left me with having to block hundreds of profiles in their entirety in order to avoid unwanted content, and even that doesn't help much. 1/30/23 - ""Not Interested"" and ""Hide videos with this sound"" still not working. no point in having these options"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really fun! I really enjoy making videos even though I'm not that cool XD but either way it's great but I've switched phones a couple times (old family phones.) And I get switched abilities. Like on my old Android I couldn't go live. Now I can. And I couldn't use the green screen filter thing on my old Android (same as before) and now it works fine. I think it depends on model and size though. Anyways, amazing app! 😁"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Can you please give your users the option to remove or turn off the double ""tap again to exit"" feature. I like this platform a lot, but I don't like that it makes me feel trapped. I never accidentally close the app, if that is what you're ""trying"" to insinuate with this feature. When I want to close the app, I actually want to close the app. I don't think it's healthy for kids, which most of your consumers are, if I (a 28y old) keep getting sucked back in to scrolling into the abyss. Thank you."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's nice for the entertainment value. But, it is a massive resource hog! Watching shorts, etc., is okay-ish. However, watching lives will drain the battery very quickly. Upon installing it, make sure to remove all permissions, alerts, notifications, and disable background data unless you want to have loud alerts play even when the phone is silenced as well as eating up your data plan!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You cannot discuss neurodivergence without having videos suppressed or muted. The app tracks the info you input into your phone on other apps (which it states in its privacy policy) for advertising, and moderation is nearly non-existent. There are many great creators with excellent ideas and unique voices, but it often feels like you need to actively fight to find them because content is shown to you strictly algorithmically. While useful, it is exhausting and invasive."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like the app in general, but recently after using the feature once, the Connect LIVE to PC/Mac option has disappeared from my list of live streaming options. I can't seem to find any resolutions online and I've already submitted two reports that haven't received any response. I can't even find a way to re-apply for the feature. My rating will sit at 3 stars until this issue is resolved."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app. Only thing that bugs me is when i use my own audio, like talking in a video, the sound is really low, its not my phone because every other video app is fine and have normal levels of audio. For some reason its at a low level. That needs to be fixed. Or there must be a solution im not aware of that raises the audio to my videos when i speak."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Don't bother trying to contact support. They won't answer at all. Two things I really hate about this app without getting a chance to even try other features: 1 videos auto play (at max volume). I'd rather have the option to decide whether I want to hear the video or not. 2 I was told my username was taken. Yet when I searched for the user who had it not a single profile came up. It's a unique name that's never been taken on any other social media site.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really like this app but there are really annoying things as a non iphone user. First of all, my camera quality it's really good but in the moment I open TikTok it seems like I'm using a 2006 phone. Second, most of the filters are not available? Like simple filters as ""date"" or ""brown hair"" or ""blue eyes"". I'm 100% sure my phone can support that type of filters but I still can't use them. These two problems really ruin the experience. Please do something."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great platform. Amazing algorithm and great user data protection. Easy to use and configure. Very few ads, and the ones I do see are relevant. I use TT to learn about all sorts of things...home repairs, exercises, health tips. And of course it's entertaining in other ways without being irritating or one dimensional. The mix of posts is just right, and I like that I can consume vids without creating them."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok provides a great experience, with an algorithm that tailors to what you want to see. You'll find some of the most unbiased information possible, and delivered in easy to digest bits. The only thing I find lacking is some of the features and settings are locked behind device model and/or region. On the plus side, at least they don't steal your info like *some* companies..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Idk if it was some update or not but when sharing videos through messenger instead of opening in the app when clicked, like every other platform does, it takes us to a inappropriate looking site to play the video. The video plays and then a inappropriate video will play almost immediately afterwards. If you want to like or share the video it will then open the app to do these items. I wish it would just go back to normal. I have a lot of friends overseas and we communicate only via messenger."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Since the last update. The text to speech feature is gone and other features as well. I had try to contact support about this issue and i had no response at all. I use this feature for all of my videos. Needless to say it had been a major setback. For the rest i love the app, I'm willing to fix the reviews after the issues with last update are fix."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! There's barely any problems i have all of which are very minor and can be solved with an easy fix. One being the just watched feature, whenever i click the button it either loads for a minute if that isn't what it does, it will take me down to the video and then take me back up. It gets quite annoying but it's easy to manage most the time. Other than that and other things i don't care much about this app is great! Keep it up."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I got a new phone and it worked for a hot second. And then suddenly I had been logged out. After I logged back in, I couldn't see any of my videos or my followed. I couldn't make videos either. And I filed a problem and haven't gotten any feedback, so... I'm so really done with this app. And the worst thing is that I was really getting the hang of and making somewhat decent content, then you freaking delete it.😤😠"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I confidently/strongly suggest there should be an option to block audios. I've always enjoyed tiktok as a way to lounge after a long day, but at this point I can only spend not even a few minute's on there anymore. The newest trend always attaches to a specific sound, on my page every other video. Sometimes the sound get's so overused, so repetitive, I genuinely find myself wanting to delete the app. If I could block audios, I would enjoy using what used to be my favorite app, again."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app and an even more wonderful community. However, if you are open to suggestion for future updates, it would be nice to see other people's duets through the original post. Endless scrolling through the 'sound' takes forever when I just want to see my original content creator. We can scroll backwards in a duet, but i cant find an efficient way to find other versions of duets with the original."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best media platform ever, there's so many different things to make and do and watch, you can do lip syncing, dancing,funny videos and more!! Plus you can customize what you'll like to see on your for you page (you'll see) very easy to see what's trending. I do not recommend this app for anybody under 13, because you can text random people, and there is some bad things in videos on the fyp such as cuss words but it's good ツ👍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"While the new updates and features are cool and much needed, I think they came at the cost of glitches and bugs. It takes multiple tries to pause a video, view new notifications, open a message in your inbox, like a video, and to actually use the new ""just watched"" feature when you go to someone's page. I also wish there was a way to turn off the in app notifications from TikTok about events, lives, etc."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's great, but every couple minutes, it lags and crashes. This problem has been happening more and more often. Reloading doesn't work, relaunching doesn't work, and now my only option is to delete it and then redownload it. Hopefully that works. Update: It didn't work. Now every vid I scroll to turns the screen entirely white, and when I view a page that isn't my own, the fyp goes completely black. When the vids aren't glitchy, the sound is. This app has become a bona fida shitshow. I'd give 0⭐"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I don't know why, but I've been having problems with the audio, not the ones I upload, but with the ones that show up in my for you page, or basically every video in general. I've tried multiply times to fix it by uninstalling the app and installing it again, which did work for a very short time until I exited the app. Even with my voulme on, it still doesn't work. Please try to figure it out and fix it, because without the audios it's really boring.."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Really liked it the first time I used it. Which is good because that is the only time the app would let me use it. It keeps telling me I have no network connection even though all my other apps are working fine. Tried all the fixes on the web and YouTube with no luck. Sent a message to TikTok using the ""Report A Problem"" feature and haven't heard a word even acknowledging that they received the message, let alone anything like a solution. Too bad. I really wanted to get into this platform."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a perfect application, with the ability to post and see other people's skit posts. The only problem is storage! I got it when you posted, it takes storage, but I don't post! I think it needs to be fixed. Secondly, I've blocked some people and I can still watch their videos and still DM me. Without it, this is a great app !!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app, but after a while it started glitching. I don't know how to fix it, but when I try to post I edit my clips but when I press next, the screen goes black, I've restarted my phone multiple times, unitstalled and reinstalled the app, but nothing works. If someone could help me fix this, that would be great, but in the meantime, someone should look into this."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"First off, this app is amazing. There's so many pros to this app. Like, you could find any video you might like, make friends, post your thoughts and express yourself through short clips, etc. But, however there are a couple problems aswell. Starting off with, if there's something im trying to get off my fyp ill ignore it, delete it, whatever. But it keeps showing up. Also, I believe this is a problem with my phone not the app but its like there is a filter or something. Its a bit blurry and bad"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"app used to be entertaining, now it's just angering. can't try filters in peace without a message popping up in the middle of the screen ""microphone is off when a sound is added"". ok, one time is fine, but EVERYTIME i want to try a different filter? sigh. the photo posts where you can't even pause because it shows you the caption in a weird format, like, no one asked for that! we were fine reading long captions just the way it was before. so many more things, but i'm running out of characters."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Well I enjoy the app and all of the funny creatures. But I've been noticing that the music doesnt always play when the video plays.. like the music will start but half way it stops.. but it fits the video.. I hope they fix that. However.. I have not had any problems with it.. I always watching videos from here.. even if they aren't a minute long. I am hoping that they might add a few more long times setting bc there's so many stories that people tell but only with 60 sec? More time sets plz.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Please integrate a feature that we can watch the videos with whatever sounds that are included like talking but the ability to remove the songs. For example. When you tap on the audio and it's that awful oh no sound... I can be taken to the page like it is now, BUT I'm able to turn it off and NEVER hear it in another video ever again. That. Would. Be. AMAZING 👏"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love Tik tok and the platform, it's a beautiful place to express oneself. Though I have a complaint. It has taken me over 24hours & not still been able to post just one video because my dance moves isn't in sync with the music . I keep editing it and after editing everything will be ok but immediately I click 'save, the video scatters again, I keep repeating the whole process and it's becoming too tiring. This happened in my previous videos. It took me doing it repeatedly before I could post"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a great app. Don't get me wrong I love the videos and things and ads aren't a problem. The reason I give this a 4 instead of 5 is for a few things. I would like to see a bump in the max video size. 60 secs is a little short but I get it if it has something to do with server managent. Finally you should make a system where videos people publish if they made it is under their copyright so if someone re uploads it the owner can take action. Overall an amazing experience!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Love this app. But lately it won't open. When I open it just shuts down but after opening three times it asked to clear history then it works for a while but when I close it then try to open it again it doesn't work. You guys really need to fix this please. I will update my rating when it's fixed. I tried to email them and it comes back as undeliverable. I'm fixing to delete the app permanently. Can someone please respond! Still no response! Really no one going to answer my messages! 😡😡😡😡
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I joined a few months ago, so far it's been pretty easy to figure out. It's been fun watching other people's videos and posting mine. I did however lose my magnifying glass for searching new filters, trending filters, etc.,. it eventually was restored, and then yesterday it disappeared again. I cleared the cache in the app and on my phone, installed and reinstalled the app, nothing works. Please fix my ability to search filters."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Look man, the app is great, but when I scroll and like, favorite, or whatever on the app for not even an hour, and I get the ""you're tapping too fast, take a break"" message pops up and persists for a full 24 hour day, come on man, that's ridiculous. Even more so when you get to know that I take breaks, several hours long each time to prevent this, and it still happens. Godsend though, the ""you've been on a while, go outside"" message has since stopped. Thank you. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I think this is a very good app but one thing that bugs me is the texting. It's not like Messager where you can see when people are active if you're trying to text someone you don't know when they will text back and it'll probably take like 30 minutes for someone to respond and you might be busy then and it'll take more hours trying to text that person who you want to talk to. Over all this app is good for videos and music.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So. It turns out tiktok made this relaunch app thing and it basically makes the app less fun. You can't comment on videos, you can't search anything cause there is no search bar. You can't even change the settings because they removed the settings button. All I wanted was to be able to search up the kind of sound and dance. That's all😭 I don't like this app at all."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's great...But it has many issues. There are full on videos out there that are very obviously bad, inappropriate, need to be taken down. It's come to the point people mass report over and over and over till something is FINALLY done about it. Filters don't always work and it can be very buggy. Also no one likes the new notification system layout. Also just all the issues cosplayer go through, the lies, scams, etc. it's so bad!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is very entertaining . Sometimes there may be some inapropriete content for certain ages . I've also recently had a problem while scrolling through tiktok a video freezes and the previous audio plays but I just swipe up and down then a couple minutes later it happens again I'm not sure what the reason is since everything has been just fine until this point .
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm having an issue with adding music to photos which has never happened before until recently. When you select music for your photo(s), it's only playing 15 seconds of the song when it's supposed to be 1 minute long. I've tried editing, different songs, contacted support and I still can't get it to work. No offense, but Instagram has far superior music editing. There are way more songs available and you can choose up to 90 seconds of songs to play on your photos etc. Regards, Steve😉"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app truly. However, I'm giving it 2 stars because photo mode keeps getting taken away from me. I haven't had it for a month and a half now. I have tried reporting it as a problem multiple times, but I keep getting the same response that they are working on rolling it out to all the users. I think, i stead of giving us updates every month that change the layout and appearance of the app, they should work on making sure every user gets access to the same features."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, it's a good app. And I don't struggle too much posting edits or content. The only issue is though is that, recently, I've been struggling to even get in the app! Everytime I try and open it, it crashes! Sometimes it will tell me ""Tiktok is working due to misconfigureations, please press this to fix them"" and then it crashes again!! I have to uninstall and reinstall just to have 1 session of watching it! Really, really annoying."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"so, tiktok is a decent app, but with a few downsides. First off, if you have an AMOLED display, be very cautious. it can give you a burn in, and it will. i am speaking from experience. take all recommended pre cautions to avoid one. two, you can and will lose track of time, if you're watching it. it can be very addictive and seriously change the way your brain functions. could be better but it could be worse. i personally have no problems with much else."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing ,however i did have some glitches happen while using this app .for example , when you press the button to record a video with a sound,the sound plays while the camera is just stuck in a position, and no, on the camera app this have naver happend.this glitch has been occouring about for 1 month and a half. Sometimes it works but no often. I hardly ever record videos anyways , but I do however post edits , it works just fine, so it doesn't really bother me that"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Ticktok became very buggy lately. I really loved the app and used it a lot. But the editor doesn't save my edits like adding text. And it was mixing and matching sounds and the image in the not correct way. I really hope that you will solve those problems because they become major issue for me. Please return the good innovative tiktok. Also I'm creating educational content and my videos are removed from some violation that isn't even right, and it's frustrating."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't know what happened but my For You page is horrible. It keeps showing me videos that I don't like, or Tik Toks from the same people. I've tried everything, clicking the ""Not Interested"" button, interacting with videos I like, but I'm stuck with these horrible videos I don't want to see. It's frustrating, I just want to have a good time in this app, but it's only stressing me out."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Certainly addictive with their algorithm selecting videos you like. However user controls, both in video editing and watching, could be heavily improved. One flagship item, the looping video, should be a user selectable user setting. I would turn it off in a heartbeat. I really prefer my video to play and stop at the end. As for video editing, there is almost too much to mention. Arbitrary time selection of stitched video clips is hard to grasp."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Keeps saying unstable internet connection when it's not unstable. This is a common issue that never gets fixed, can't use the app when it says this. Tried everything and then it deleted all my drafts trying to reinstall it, which still didn't fix it. No point using it now that I've lost everything. Not that I can use it anyways. Worked fine every time I tried it, now when I'm trying to actually record and post something, it won't work. Of course."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It works fine but sometimes when I've been updating my other apps the app just will not open. No matter how many times I restart my phone it just won't open! It keeps showing the blacks screen with the tiktok logo but after 2 seconds it closes itself. I don't know if it's something I'm doing or it's just the app but this is so annoying when it happens.. Not only that, when it glitches out like this it will also make other apps freeze or crash!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's fun, but inexplicably, when I speak while recording, the sound doesn't play back on the video unless I've recorded with Bluetooth earbuds or speaker connected, which puts audio out of sync. It's annoying and I can't find anything online saying whether others have experienced the same thing and how they fixed it. The app is basically unusable for making videos like this."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Too many sponsored tiktoks, the video editing is laggy, and it changes your settings. I don't use the messages, because i get too much spam. I always get a pop-up of: ""We've changed it so that you can talk to everyone!"" even though I've MULTIPLE TIMES changed it so that I don't have my messages on. I have this off for a REASON. There's been a few different examples of this, but that pop-up is the most frequent."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app that picked up where Vine left off, mostly anyways. I'm enjoying it a lot so far, super easy to use. Just one issue though: Can't edit videos after they have been posted. Like right after you hit submit you forgot something and you can't go back and change it(The description for example). It's unforgiving to mistakes."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Okay, I love this app and I highly recommend it but there is something that drives me crazy about it that NEEDS to be fixed! when you type a comment and go to backspace it moves to the left before each backspace. meaning it is impossible to correct mistyping without going to another video and then back and typing slower so you don't mistype and have to start over again. I've had this problem since i started taking it months ago, I keep hoping you'll fix it and you never do. 5 stars when fixed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"When you make a certain video as uninterested and it gives you the little ""we'll make sure to show you less of this content"" it doesn't actually do that. I've had to do this multiple times. I could care less if there's a trend going on, if I don't want to see certain topics/videos and I put the filter option on that I don't want to see something, I shouldn't see videos relating to that topic. It turns your ""for you page"" into a ""not for you page"" since it continuously keeps showing unwanted vids"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is amazing. I came Errors occur while using the app. for the For example when you press the button to record. Video with sound when the sound plays. The camera is only stock in one position .no more. On A camera app has never been like this. This The error is happening for about 1 month. And a half. Sometimes it works but not often. I Anyway record video anytime but I do. However post edited. And it works fine. So It's not really me bro. viral my videos 📝 thanks
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great app transition is smooth throughout as well as being able to learn and understand how to navigate through it. The section that recommend videos based on the user's history has not disappointed myself with something that isn't my taste or forte to indulge in. overall the app's functionality and operations compliment each other so well that you are able to enjoy your time watching videos without stress or wait times. Thank you.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm truly not the kind of person to leave a bad review but I am entirely fed up with the bugs this app has. There is never a time when I cannot find a bug. My recorded tik toks are slowed at the begin. Clips always end in a glitch making transitions impossible. Reusing the sound makes it mute. After going to the record screen then back to the fyp, the videos turn black. This app has gone so down hill. Very disappointed. Not worth downloading."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like the app. The main issue I have with it would be the notifications. Every time I go on my phone, I’ll get a notification like “*username* liked a video you reposted”, but when I enter the app, it won’t appear in the inbox no matter how many times I refresh it. Also, one thing I’m sure a lot of people would appreciate in a “go to bottom” button the favourites. I have a lot of videos in my favourites that I would look for, but they’re all at the bottom, and it takes some time to scroll there."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I loved how functional the app was and don't get me wrong it still is but the ads have ruined it. I know it provides money, however you have to relate to the viewers side. It has an ad after every 6 to 8 videos. For people who sit there and scroll through the app, it's just gets in the way and it gets a little annoying after a while. I still love the app but I wish the ads were around every 15 to 20 videos. Thank you."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I was skeptical about the concept at first but it's actually real fun! I would love to have collections when I add videos to my favourites though. To be able to classify those videos and find them more easily in the future. They also need to fix the text duration. If you have several clips and you trim them, then the text duration doesn't sync properly with the video."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I recommend this app 80%. It's a very good app and it helps people get creative. Just sometimes it's very slow and it shows ads way too quickly. I also don't like is when Tiktok violates my video when there was nothing wrong with it. If you could just fix these suggestions, that will be splendid. Also, another think that bugs me is the iOS has way better qualities of the app than an android. Then, I like that on the app it does not take a lot of battery of your phone. Okay, could you please fix these bugs and that would great. Thank you!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like the app, I think it's entertaining and easy to use. My biggest complaint are the static buttons that area visible while scrolling, especially the white ones (+, like, share,...). They got burned into my last phone screen, so now I'm afraid to use TikTok on my new device. They should definitely adjust the home screen so this isn't a problem."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This Is a perfectly functioning app, with the ability to post and see other peoples skits. The only issue is the storage! I get that when you post, it takes storage, but I dont even post! I think that this needs to be fixed. Second, I have blocked some people and I still see their videos and still can DM me. Other than that, this is a great app!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The editing experience could be a lot better. While you can, of course, get a video editor and create anything you want, a simple addition like changing the duration of pictures would be great! Moreover, effects are simply put on a stack, with no means of selecting anything inbetween, so you're left using undo a lot. If we could select a certain transition, for example to change its length or delete it, that would help a lot with fine-tuning effects and transitions. (I may of course be a noob)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Constantly crashing, the app itself is what it is. And im happy they put in the feature where you can see past videos. But the app crashes Constantly. Either you will be watching somthing and the video will stop and it will refresh. Or you will be searching for a topic and the app freezes and crashes. Think there is a bug in the app and should be looked at. 🤔"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really love the app, but I have a complaint about a possible bug. I can't watch a full video, it always stops about half way through as if it's loading. When it does let me watch a full video, it won't let me rewatch it. This happens bigger matter where I am or the strength of my internet. It is highly inconvenient and very annoying."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is okay and all, but an bug i recently encountered is that whenever i press and hold the screen to bring up the menu to add the video to favorites and others doesn't appear. Once that happens I can't exit out of it, neither does switching to ""following"" or ""for you"" fixes the issue I have to close the app and open it back up. I'm not sure if anyone else encountered this issue but please fix it in the next update."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love TikTok to watch videos and to post, however, the most recent updates on the app are not the greatest. When we choose videos and photos from our phone to create a video on TikTok we can't really do many changes to the clips. Before we were able to press on each clip and trim them. Before it was so much easier and now it's not the same.. Unfortunately, the app doesn't let me do sequential videos anymore, i save it to drafts and try to continue the video but all the clips somehow delete."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pretty great, however I wish there was an edit feature. As an artist it takes tons of time to complete a drawing, so I'd like a feature where you could save your video, come back to it and continue. **Update: they have added this feature however, I noticed my captions has disappeared and I no longer have to option to turn them on or off. The option is simply gone."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. Its a place to make videos and speak to your friends. You can learn dances easily and know all the words by the end. Its also good that you can have an option of a private account when you can choose who follows you. There's always new filters, trends and dances to take a look at. Overall this app is great! Hope this review was helpful!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"it is slow when your favorite musers stream. i have had problems with it and my wifi and network is full bars. i misted out on what they said and did which got me kind of mad. if you dont mind slowness then this app will be great but my experience with the lack of quality and speed it is a decent rating. although the app is slow it is fun to do on spare time. i have made ""tik tok's"" since i was very young back when it was musical.ly."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's really good video and a lot of things to do with cooking, funny, horrible, everything else to. But when I swipe left the screen just stop and froze, so I wait for 1 minute and it kick me out when I go back & do again same happened again. I reset my phone to see if work and nope still doing it. I checked update on tiktok or my phone and no updates."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Can't upload pics with a video. After I make a short vid the only option is share or next which leads you to post. There are no effects at the bottom .nor can I flip the camera while making a video. I could not do the teenage dirtbag trend. I had to turn my phone around to pics on the couch. Again after releasing your finger from a video the only option is next or share. I watched my friend do it with their iPhone. My Samsung Galaxy won't do the same. Those options are not there.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's an awesome app, just sometimes inappropriate videos do slip through. I know the team is working hard at tik Tok to stop it, but it still does happen from time to time. But aside from that it's a great app and has a section for everything. Health, art, knowledge and an infinite amount of other stuff. The fyp is a bit dumb in the beginning, but after maybe a week of using the app it's the best. Caution, you will get addicted"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"TikTok has many great features and the amount of Christian study programmes, comedy, information, services, products on it are excellent. However, the sounds that people quite often use on the short clips can be annoying and distracting. This is something to watch out for. The reason it can be annoying is that it spoils a good video. Overall though, it can be a nice to sit back and enjoy the time on it. The best features on it are : Biblical studies, language, mathematics, comedy and chat."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I love this app but the video stay stuck while the audio goes. Also when you're recording it kind of glitches a little like it gets stuck. This is only happening since the new update. The tick tock update. The old musically worked perfectly well for me anyways yes I love some of the new features yes I will continue to use this and yes I will just have to grit my teeth and deal with it. But it makes it very difficult to make a good video
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is fun, but when you're trying to film a video, it does not save the video, so you could finish it, the editing is not that bad, but it's not that great either. But overall, its good to entertain yourself and look at your phone for a couple hours, and you're never get bored. And take talk also needs to make sure that the content is appropriate for kids to watch too. But I really love this app.and also tiktok, you need to upload new edits and new filters and sounds."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Don't get me wrong. I love TikTok, it has great content and also something to pass the time with. But lately it keeps logging me out of my account and I constantly keep having to log back in but then like five minutes or less I have to log in again. Eventually after logging back in a few times it doesn't let me log in anymore. Then I have to reset my password and it happens all over again. I have tried reinstalling the app, and my phone, clearing up some storage and nothing, pls fix this issue."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I do enjoy Tiktok, the communities I've found on there are a ton of fun, but I don't like how updated are rolled out. They'll roll out a feature that quickly becomes popular, like photo mode or the new voice changers, then leave users who didn't get it initially hanging. I want to join in on trends that simply aren't available to me because of some arbitrary choice. It's an unfair system which doesn't promote growth equally. There seems to be an Apple priority too, which further proves my point."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It used to be rather easy for me to navigate and use, but all of the sudden the format of the app has been randomly changing for me throughout the day. At times, the app won't let me repost or upload stories to my account, and completely hides those features from me. And at other times it will randomly grant me access to those functions. I have no warnings or strikes on my account. It's become extremely aggravating for me to use now because it's switching back and forth from being out of date.."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Edit 2. After 2 Used primarily on tablet. Now it will not stay on landscape mode. I will update it to good or 5 stars once I am able to use it again. Fixed and some features added. For a time wasting app, this was great. Easy to use, easy to just look at videos and have a good time. Content for everyone no matter your likes. I gotta say I was impressed with the cheer amount of silly and funny videos."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love the app, it's amazing and inspiring but things are getting annoying because of the new updates, like not allowing us to use our own audio and taking away some filters. And also the app has been crashing for five days, it won't log in, please fix the problem. EDIT:why do I suddenly have Israelis in my following page??? I DON'T FOLLOW THEM!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is exquisite, the only problem I have is dueting, whenever I duet, it get's to a point and the music doesn't play anylonger, yet the video hasn't finished. Two, when I make videos, the result comes out slower than actual even when the speed is normal. Lastly, it consumes a heck of data, with or without the data saver of the app. Please, I really love tiktok and I'll like if you can fix these bugs as quick as possible. Aside from the things listed above, the app is okay. Thank you."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love communities I've found on the app ,but the user experience could use some improvement .For example ,the editing tool can be glitchy . I had a draft I was working on all year ,but when I would go in the edit and replace clips,it would completely replace different clips with my new recording, deleting my progress. Instead of updating the look of the interface, I wish the developers would prioritize usability and universal design principles."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall, the app is very good, but it should give you the option to change what page it opens on, since not everyone wants to start on the For You page. It should also have a button or something that temporarily hides the UI when watching videos, because while there *is* a feature that lets you watch the video without the UI, it'll probably result in part of your hand covering the screen. Additionally, some features are only available in certain regions, which is just awful imo."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really like this app, but I hate waiting for new features. For example. I have an android, and I am stuck waiting for a Playlist option. It is just not available for me....at all... It is frustrating to me, but honestly that may just be my ASD/ADHD brain looking to organize my video better... Everything else has been good so far. And before anyone asks yes, my app is up to date, and the beta program is full so if it is a new feature that is not available to everyone just yet, then stop theads."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The aap is very addictive and interesting. Some time there may be some in appropriate content for certain ages. I've also recently had a problem while scrolling through tik Tom a video freejess and the previous a audio plays but I just wipe up and wown then a couple minutes later it happens again I'm not sure what the reason is since every thing has been jus fine until this point.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Edit: My experience with this app is just getting worse and worse, not only are the filters usability questionable by the day, but lately I can't get through the majority of the skits, vids, and compilations (no matter the length) without locking up and freezing. While other times, there is no problems. This is getting ridiculous. Please fix your app. Not to mention, sometimes my phone will flicker until I have to restart."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hey developers, please bring back the 10 min videos. Also, you have some issues with the captions. The last update was great. This update I have to change my text and font every single line! That's annoying and takes forever. Other than that, this app is fun and very educational. It's easy to use, and with capcut, you can make great content."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The content on tik tok is ok but there are a lot of functional problems with the app itself. Firstly, the coments and captions on videos have a character limit that is too small. Second, there is no way to find out when a video was posted unless you look at the comments. Third, the for you page will sometimes reload and there is no way to find videos you havent liked. Fourth, the message ""youre tapping too fast. Slow down!"" appears when I try to like a video no matter how long I have been online"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I have always love this app. I've been on it for maybe 2 or 3 years. It certainly made covid lockins a lot more bearable! However as of recent the lagg on the lives and audio issues while recording a video thru the app are almost unbearable. The voice doesn't line up with the live I'm watching now. There's like. 3 to 5 second delay between the sound and their lips a lot! Please please fix this. 😕 My ADD can't take it
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is really adicting in all honesty. I've found some of my personal favourite songs and some good friends because of it. The only bad thing about it is that at random times it gets REALLY laggy and the ""video"" stops working for a bit, but you can fix that by closing the app and opening it back up! (Sorry for any misspelled words)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The new vine! Overall I love this app. Fun, addicting, great user experience. One bit of feedback about the new update. The new effects set up is awful. Much harder to tell which effect is which. The new slider makes it next to impossible to get the effects timed in the right spot, to see where it's at in the time line & the effects are now laggy & glitchy in the video which kind of ruins your vid & makes them not worth the hassle"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"No privacy whatsoever!! TOOK MY CONTACTS WITHOUT PERMISSION AND RECOMMENDS THEM TO EVERYONE, THAT'S UNACCAPTABLE! disgusting! - - - - MINOR: links crash into feed, back button just switches to previous video, sometimes when i leave (and close the app) it keeps playing audio, this is terrible when i am in public, switching off the screen doesn't help, i need to manually enter into the app again and close it through active apps menu."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"As a TalkBack user, and a blind listener at these videos, I really like it. However, there does need to be some accessibility workarounds. A lot of the buttons are unlabeled, so if you can work on that, I would very well appreciate it. The app is good though, but it's four stars for accessibility. Keep doing what you're doing, and I do like the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love the communities I've found on this app, but the user experience could use some improvement.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Wonderfully addicting. Update: After a long time using this app, I realized that when duetting someone with Bluetooth headphones, there's a delay in your microphone. I don't know if this happens for anyone else but it happens for me every single time I try to do it. And I believe to fix it the creators or developers should add a feature when you can manually adjust the timing of your audio, that would be amazing. But that's it, thanks for reading."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Well, you might have your own reasons why you removed the option to select our OWN choice of music from our music library, or maybe I'm finding it hard to navigate the app. But either way, it's pretty useless to me if I cannot use my own favorite music, I can't use the same music being used by everybody (rolls eyes), I guess it's hard luck for me. Great app though, but not for me anymore. I miss the old musically."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really like this app and I feel like there's something here for everybody. Especially since this app seems to be based on an algorithm so it makes finding videos you like extremely easy. I have a couple of issues with it though. Specifically, I feel like certain features could be added to the app that would make it easier to manuver around. Features like a playlist function, or an ""episode"" function that would make it that a creator can link multiple videos together if there's multiple parts."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app has a good platform and a great associated community! There’s a decent selection of fillers and effects, and remixing videos is simple. However, there are a few technical problems. There are almost no absolute timestamps for videos and comments. What’s worst is how difficult it is to type in comment and description boxes. I’m not sure what causes this, but my caret easily gets misaligned with the text that I’m editing. This leads to parts of the text becoming frustratingly uneditable."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! There's barely any problems I have, all of which are very minor and can be solved with an easy fix. One being the 'just watched' feature, whenever I click the button it either loads for a minute. If that isn't what it does, it will take me down to the video and then take me back up. It gets quite annoying but it's easy to manage most the time. Other than that and other things I don't care much about, this app is great! Keep it up ^^"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love tiktok, but since 2 weeks it makes my phone bug. When I open the app, it stays on the menu (just Tiktok is wrote) and then when I switch off my screen, I can't access my phone back again. Even if I restart my phone, I still can't access my phone! I've been trying to fix this issue by myself by uninstalling the app and install it again but it actually doesn't work. Please help me to fix this issue, it's really annoying"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This App would've been given a 5/5 from me by now, but for some reason they keep reverting back to the old editing software. One minute you can't clip videos, then you can. One minute you're able to remove sound from different clips, then you can't. At least ""go back"" to letting us clip videos together and edit the sound when and where we need to."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I really enjoy using tick toc but there is a few buts.. 1. Going live- why is it that you need so many followers to go live that number should be cut down in half to a hundred and there should be themes to so everyone can participate. 2. Editing. Why can't I edit the video after I finished it 😒I think that you should be able to edit it afterwards. 3.editing parts - sometimes I'll be making a video and the ending messes up but the beginning was really well put together and sometimes it's really hard to get that perfect shot again. Why can't we edit parts of our video before and after it's finished ordering even. I made a video today and I wasn't able to complete it because the ending got messed up and I couldn't keep the beginning so I had to restart the whole thing. It's very discouraging. 4.. Music - why is there not alot variety..
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Like the app very much. The only problem I have with it , is it's storing a ton of temporary data on my phone, that I have to constantly clear out. Some things that I wish were improved, is the interface, I wish I could get rid of all the writing that covers the video while I watch it. Along with the option to select a sort of ""genre"" to load for videos for you specific tastes for the 'for you' page. Instead of it going by which videos you watch and react to."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The past experience with tik tok has been great, but lately for some unknown reason: the little icons of where you like, comment and such dissappear for the first few videos. After they reappear, the videos don't even play and are just blank. Everytime this happened, I had to reinstall tik tok to get it to work, and when I got back on it would do the same thing again! Please, fix this!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is the best app for dubbing...just that all our liked videos are being saved... It will be convenient if there are two separate options for ""SAVING"" and ""LIKING""...I'd like many videos but not want to save them all for later use... Since all the liked videos are getting saved I've actually stopped liking(pressing the heart symbol) all the videos I actually like which they deserve... I like only those videos I want to do later... Please have two separate options like instagram (sorry for comparing but that option is too good and it will be easy for you to understand) ....it let's us like and save..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The algorithm is good and I have no problems watching content, but creating my own content is where there's issues. The voice effects weren't available to me until far after those trends died out. ""Photo mode"" for slideshows is completely unavailable to me. I have reported problems to tiktok and they basically told me that some users just can't use certain features, so I'm just SOL. The app is still usable, just makes me not want to make content."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Editing my review after two years of use. The app has made some strange changes. It now cuts off audio at the end of the video, or will glitch and freeze when trying to film the end of one. They made a strange change, so now you have to record for minimum of 1 second, which makes transitions difficult. The worst part is that they want you to pay for views. If you don't, you can expect for no one to see your posts. Videos that used to average 2k views, now get 1-200. It's frustrating."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app but it would be super awesome if we could edit the name of a sound or other thing that we favorite (at least in our own view, so it doesn't take away the credit to the creator). Sometimes I save them to go back and make videos later and it's really hard to find the right one. It would also be cool if we could block certain people or tags from showing up because there's some parts of TikTok I just don't want to see when I scroll."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I don't know why the update is too much difficult.It has been good so far. But I think it got updated. And after that I can't see trending videos and sounds. Like on the former TikTok, there is a place where one can find trending sounds, videos and dances but it no longer have it. Can I get it back please. Every other thing works perfectly fine"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The updates made everything change. Before the updates, the app was good and everything worked perfectly fine. Once the update happened though, the functions wouldn't work that well, at all. For example, I put a video as favorite and later on decide to unfavorite it it won't, same with the likes and following. When I try to share, duet, or switch, the app crashes. I also can't change any of the settings or anything involved with my account."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Don't know if it's just me, other people, a glitch, or probably a license kind of thing, but whenever I click on the sound to see other videos that used it, some of them would say ""Sound Not Working."" But if I search the sound physically instead of clicking on it from a video, the page pops up perfectly fine and I can listen from there. Some work, and some don't. Can you please fix this? Great app btw, too bad it's getting deleted eventually..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app overall. The UI Overlay is really annoying sometimes though. If there would be an option to make it transparent temporaryly that would be great. Sometimes the most important parts of a video are hidden because of that, in the previous iteration of the app it kind of worked. Long pressing on the video used to pop up a small box in the middle of the screen, that made the description and the right side toolbar vanish. I'm really not sure why you got rid of it. Everyone hates it.Reverse it"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app for entertainment purposes is great. However, if you try creating content you might not have the same experience. My video editing features did not receive the update despite numerous troubling shooting and having once had it (somehow reverted?). I've had an open ticket with the support team since November with no resolution in sight. Can be extremely frustrating if you ever are in need of help and can't find an answer from other users"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The only thing I dont like are the amount of ads I have watch to get into what I'm trying to do, for example.... coloring I have to watch one to open it, tons during it, another when I finish it pic, them another one to start a new one and so forth.... there's just so dang many! The app says it's free but then they get you by putting all those apps in there and try to get you to upgrade/ purchase an options for no ads. However, I am unemployed due to health issues and I'm not on disability yet."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love tiktok it's creative and a wonderful app these are my positive thoughts. But I also have negative thoughts, it doesn't happen to all people but sometimes I go on the app and when I click on one of the videos it hangs and then the audio still plays then it glitches. And sometimes when I'm trying to use a sound/audio it says ""This sound isn't available in your country"" fixing these problems would be appreciated! But overall it's a great app and I recommend it!"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Though it is a great way for people to share vid clips it is lacking on one (maybe two) basic need(s). I have had many great laughs watching the varied clips but it goes down hill when I get to the mail tray. There seems to be no way to delete the official Tik Tok notices (mail). Since the inevidable is that my box will fill up I am concidering deleting my account and app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The ads get very annoying after a while. A lot of the time, I open the app and the first thing that pops up is an ad. 2 or 3 of my accounts have gotten banned for unnecessary reasons, and for some reason whenever I like and favorite a video, after scrolling a bit further down, the like on the video gets removed. I've also had problems with it glitching out and the screen turning black/white and closing me out of the app completely after no longer than 10 seconds."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, it's a hellscape of content being shoved down your throat, with an archaic algorithm, and buggy video editing. However, it is much better than the video editing that I already have ( which is none) and honestly, I have a good time with it, so long as I remember to search for things that I like, rather than use the for you page That automatically comes up."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I do like looking through this app once in awhile. It can be a little Annoying until you customize it and start to get things you like but once you're there it's another source of entertainment. After a few laughs I turned it off. turn off notifications for new videos because it gets annoying very fast. You don't need to know every time someone posted some stupid video. I myself don't actively display content. that might change someday. Thank you for staying on my SD card.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I spend too much time on this app, and I've noticed that they removed the slideshow feature for some tiktok creators, myself included. It's very frustrating, especially since sometimes I just want to create a slideshow that other people swipe through. It's completely unfair, and then tiktok has a tendency to gatekeeper features from creators until they're 'popular' or 'trending'. The algorithm is great, but there's no incentive for me to create and share, which is a big part of the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"My experience with TikTok so far is great, I had it for 2 years before and I do recommend using this app if you want to extend your business to other users or just in general, since this is one of the most used apps on the play store. But, the option for text-to-speech is suddenly not available, and a solution is not present online anywhere! There has been no announcement about the removal of this option on certain operating systems, ages, languages, etc. and I am very confused."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Some issues are there : 1. More data requires to run a video, if in a slow network it doesn't work properly I mean lagging are there. 2. Battery consumption is more than other apps. 3. Please add an option to pause video creation, it may help to pause while creating a video and resume the work whenever need if it is a long term project. So that the project would get more perfection."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app, amazing algorithm. I just wish we could have an auto scrolling option. It's really frustrating to have to scroll down at the end of a video, when one just wants to view the next one. If you could have an option that makes it easy to switch between automatic scrolling and manual scrolling, the experience would be even greater."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very disappointed with the recent update of the app. The drafts, sometimes the apps doesn't want to open and you loose all your drafts because you have to uninstalled it. Like why? You can't rerecord later in the editing process, making it hard if you want to change customs. The stories sounded like a good idea at first but now if you are trying to save as draft and you accidentally pressed the stories button, goodbye. And what's the point of the feature? You can't shared them. Ugh."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is good, but only as long as I don't want to see my personal messages from friends. I click the personal messages button, I see a list of people who sent me something, I click on the chat with the person and that's it, the app freezes, stops responding to touch, and after a few seconds it crashes to the desktop. Developers, please fix this bug."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A match made in heaven. I can control 3 servers from one station. Organize, arrange, decorate and embellish my thoughts and ideas through a schematic that I see fit. In a nutshell; I deem it worthy, necessary, relevant, powerful and effective. It allows you to make impact with little to no effort. It combines the everyday semantics and numbers and adds the scenery for more flavor, then integrates them with other sources to provide a better surfing experience. One that joins Insta and Fb. ALL"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's a garbage app that functions poorly. I signed up, and made sure to verify my email. Then I was unable to follow anyone and unable to receive messages. I only wanted to sign up cause my roommate has it and is constantly sending videos and tiktok is always begging me to use the app 'For a better experience'. This is what they call a better experience? That's laughable. They need to fix their stuff before claiming a 'Better Experience'."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There is a significant audio delay (more than one or two video frames), both during and after the creation of a post, but the audio is definitely not out-of-sync in my original video. I've searched the internet and found that I am far from the only person having this problem and it has been a problem for years. An easy solution is to allow users to manually adjust their own audio/video delay during drafting by adding a small audio control widget such as ---> Audio [-1 frame | +1 frame]."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love tiktok, don't get me wrong but I've been having this issue for a while now. Whenever I film a video, it lags at the beginning. Every. Single. Time. I thought ""Oh, maybe it was just a one time thing"" but as a I said, it's been happening for a while now. Now, if I were to lipsync to a sound, it lags behind. It's very annoying and there's nothing I can do about. There's no update avaliable, it's not just a filter I've been using, it happens every single video. Please fix this, tiktok. Yes No"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love the app, especially once you've been on for a while and have a ""for you"" page which is actually content you enjoy. However, the app is plagued with bugs. For one, I cannot stay logged in, meaning that if I close the app even for a few seconds, I have to reautgenticate. It seems that every other update the app breaks, forcing you to clear cache, reinstall it sometimes just wait for a fix to get pushed. The app itself seems to frequently get bigger down and freeze even when it is working."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It can get toxic sometimes, but the very supportive side makes up for it! Overall the app is great, but if you could, could you maybe add a feature where I can delete multiple TikTok videos I've made at the same time? I really don't wanna go over 83+ videos to delete, plus the embarrassment so it'd be super helpful. If not it's not a big deal, I still enjoy this app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"App has had alot of glitches lately. Particularly when it comes to sound. Most recently, sou d is out of synch with the person talking. You can see their lips saying something different than what the audio is. Audio for duet videos is bring cut. You can't get any sound from the video you duet not matter what. The option to use the original audio is grayed out and muted. These problems have been around for months. Despite updates they still haven't been fixed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've had TikTok for pretty long, but recently there was another update (which is normal). Tik Tok had updated the generated captions which is actually really great! But not for me, I don't like the captions on my screen blocking most of the video. I know how to take the captions off but even if I turn the setting off, the captions will still show up. This is VERY annoying, hope they fix the problem soon :)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Editing on this app is terrible! When editing a video & trying to set the duration for each clip, when I go to play, it will skip right over certain parts of the video. It lags so I have a hard time keeping the timing in sync with the music. I hate that there is not ""edit"" button for your caption once it's posted, what happens if I misspell a word or my predictive text changes a word for me that I didn't want?! Changes needed ASAP, it's so frustrating.I'm trying not to give it up all together!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a nice and fun app. But my feed seems to always be filled with popular things I don't want instead of the people I follow or similar content. Also, it would be nice if the app allowed you to block sounds. Given that the experience is very largely based on sound, being unable to avoid unpleasant sounds and songs ruins the experience."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Unfortunately, there are too many bugs, likes keep dissappearing, and saved videos as well. I like the app, but the customer support team is unfortunately absent most of the time, closing tickets without a resolution, and don't let me get started on the effects that are always missing with every update, even tho they mention adding those features. It needs a lot more attention from my point of view"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is so hard to use. They got rid of the options to change speed 10X and crop frames. You try to do a voiceover, but you don't know how long it needs to be until after you've recorded the vocals... But after you're done recording, you can't go back and trim the video to the proper length to match your words without erasing the whole thing and starting over. You can't just upload your own audio track either. It's almost useless at this point."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Real people being real funny. App itself is pretty good, but could use a couple features. If they could combine the some of the web app features into this app also, it would be MUCH better. After 3 days, I did start seeing ads, but it's only every 4 or 5 videos maybe. It would be better if it was easier to tell the difference between ads & videos. (They are marked, but most times you're too busy giggling at the previous video to realize the next one's an ad. Just a bit more noticeable)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love it the features and funny effects on it. I'm not sure if anyone else has this problem but the ads that pop up, are sometimes really long. Let's say a skin care add, is like 2 minutes long. Sometimes it won't let me scroll up on the adds and when I restart TikTok. I get the add again. I had to restart my phone multiple times for the add to go away. Sometimes the adds can be like 10 seconds. That's my only problem. After all great app I recommend it. 🙂"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I was considering increasing my rating as the performance and issues have been gradually improving. But the thing is I KEEP having to deal with issue after issue that pop up all the time. The latest is that now bookmarking videos just doesn't work any more and likely hasn't for weeks without me noticing. On top of the audio/visual glitches, the random freezing and crashing, and getting temporarily BANNED without warning or reason just to be restored unceremoniously the next day, it's ridiculous."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Can you please fix the bugs with being able to use our favorite sounds with new uploads?! I have 179 saved and can only access like 10 of them. Everytime I click on ""use this sound"" and try to upload a video, the sound goes away and I can't use it. I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it and its still doing it. Help!! I'll change my stars when you guys fix the problem. Thanks."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the app, it teaches me some cool life hacks and it's amazing to have whenever you're bored. However, it's the only app where full screen mode on my A80 won't actually be full screen. For example, some Android phones have the option to fully remove the navigation bar and enables you to navigate by swiping, Tik Tok however shows a little white line at the bottom of the screen which is quite annoying and unattractive as the app's navigation is black in itself."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App is great, but recently for some reason its not letting me switch my images to photo mode, the button that's supposed to be on the bottom middle of the screen doesn't show up, so I can't upload the photos I want to, I've tried everything I know, unistalling, reinstalling, checking for updates, litrslly everything yet for some reason its just not showing up, and other people have the same issue as me. Can you fix this?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing, however I did have some glitches happen while using the app. For example, when you press the button to record a video with a sound, the sound plays while the camera is just stuck in a position, and no, on the camera app this has never happend. This glitch has been occurring for about 1 month and a half. Sometimes it works but not often. I hardly ever record videos anyways, but I do however post edits, and it works just fine, so it doesn't really bother me that much."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's okay, but I wish I could use longer parts of songs, or, at least, upload the whole song in bits. Ex, I love theatre, but when I try to make a video with a song, I can only use a little part, or not the climax or the part I want to use. I know, copywrite, but still. Sometimes, also, I will search for music that was VISIBLY ON THERE A FEW MINUTES AGO but just isn't on there anymore. And this is when I search for anything, even if it's popular. Thank you in advance."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is great for when you need to he cheered up, but there's a problem I have. When I am recording, sometimes I stop in the middle of recording the video and save it to drafts so I can continue recording later. Recently TikTok has not been letting me go back and continue shooting the video, so I have to start all over. This is especially difficult if you wanted to film a makeup/outfit transformation video, because the clip of you before the changed look is gone. Please fix this!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Can't finish recording a video! I love using the app, but now it glitches out so badly. When I'm recording a video, I pause to do a transition. Yet when I resume the recording, it doesnt record even when there's about 8 seconds left over and it freezes up not letting me finish my video recording. I've tried to refresh/restart the app, but it still doesn't work. Anyone else dealing with the same problem? I'll rate it better when these issues are fixed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Currently two stars because I can't get in now. I have two accounts and TikTok won't let me in. Whenever I open the app, it freezes on the ""log in with Google, Facebook, etc"" screen. My phone doesn't freeze at all, but the app does and I can't get in. No matter where I push on the screen, it won't do anything. My wifi is great and I've uninstalled and reinstalled it over and over. I've done everything I can think of to fix this. Please fix it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've had no issue with the app until recently. Everything works fine, except for my sounds, as similar with other users. I can still save sounds, but I can no longer listen to them in my favourites, as they simply have no sound sometimes, pause halfway through or do not repeat anymore? I tend to listen to my sounds all the way through before using them to make sure they are the correct ones, and the recent issues are preventing that."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I tried updating, deleted and installed tiktok on my device and I've gotten none of the new features I see others talk about. Everyone else has the new voice changing filters. Any time a new ""cool update"" comes out I always get them months after. All I've gotten is a buggy freezing screen any time I'm editing a video on the app. Update: Not only do I still not have the voice changers but now I can no longer edit my recorded videos in the app at all. I cant split, speed up, or duplicate."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I do recommend this app. The comment made previously states you can't use your own songs. But you can! I do it a lot. 1: download sounds from apps (I recommend Zedge) into audio folders 2: it will show up when you go to ""my sounds"" below the search and category rows in the ""pick a sound"" section. It's on the far right. 3. Make sure it's an MP3 file. It'll only work that way. (note: sometimes, it'll only allow you to film for 15 seconds.)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok is pretty good but I have a couple complaints. 1. Sometimes my tiktok freezes and I have to turn off my phone and turn it back on, which is weird because it doesn't happen on other apps. 2. Tiktok sometimes doesn't give your certain features like the Jessie filter for no reason, I had it once, then it disappeared. 3. Holy the moderation sucks, I seen gore on the app multiple times but you can't swear in the caption. It doesn't make sense. My rating would be lower but I like this app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Don't believe the news!!! You can absolutely control what this App does and doesn't have access to on your phone. They don't have to have your precise location or access to your contacts and such to work effectively. You can view vids and post vids without giving this app all the premssions it requests. The permissions it asks for is to give you a better (more streamlined) experience. If you choose to grant the app permissions you can change that at any time within the settings.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love tik tok, there's just a few problems though. I won't get certain notifications, like when people upload videos and when people follow me. that is not a big issue though I wish there was a recommend section for sounds. I can't find a lot of songs on it and it only shows 30 seconds. I'd appreciate it if we could have the whole song to choose from and more of a variety for sounds. Preferably, I'd want more vocaloid, but the recommend section is all I want. Please put into consideration."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"honestly i really love this app, i really do. its addicting, i can reconnect with my friends and others. but after all these updates lately, the app seems to not work as well. i have a pretty good phone which im disappointed about. when i record a video, specifically a lip sync, the audio is delayed or my recording is too fast. for example the beginning of the video would be slowed down. and currently when i record, it freezes at the beginning. i hope you guys fix this."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"My previous review detailed an issue with the spam filter locking my account and since then, this seems to have resolved! There's lots of talk about new issues with the algorithm and the ability to block certain sounds/creators/trends, but I don't seem to be having any problems in that regard at this time, thankfully. Aside from the occasional temporary connection error with no explanation, I'm not experiencing any significant issues. Good stuff :)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"So many things I could say. Obviously its a social media app focusing on quick video clips, so not healthy. The algorithm is by far the most accurate of all the apps. They are very biased and descrininatory about certain types of people, they remove videos with little to no explanation and just don't respond to appeals to get the content back. Sometimes when I post a video from drafts the audio & video will be off sync even though it was fine when I made it. Fun app but could be improved."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There should be a feature or a button in saved videos where we can search the name of the collection when saving another video. I have LOTS of saved videos and collections in my account and when saving a new video, it's harder to scroll through all the collections to find the collection where my newly-saved video will be put. It's more convenient if it has a searching button. Thank you."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app for passing time. Recently though I've had some problems and I dont know if it's because I'm on android or what. 1 the watch history opinion always disappears and reappears at random and its frustrating. 2 there was a faster way to share videos by holding down the middle of the screen and it would send the tiktok instantly, but now it does the same thing as pressing the share button"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When I tried to shoot with a sound it had 0% on the screen and then it sent me back on to the home page. Also when I went on to my account page where it tells you all your details it said 'Unfortunately this app has stopped' please fix it. One last thing is that you can only do a live stream if you have 100 fans or over, that's a little unfair."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"TikTok is a good app, it has good editing behind it, but lately I've been having an issue. Whenever I film a video, there is an audio bug. It will pick up background noise and when you go to get a preview of the video, you can hear it. The app is fully updated so, I dont know if it is because I have an andriod or not, but TikTok you need to fix this."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's been several days now that Tiktok freezes up completely on me. I cannot swipe or press any other option. If it doesn't freeze, it stays stuck on an endless loop of buffering clips. If it does work, the audio will play with no clip. Sometimes, the audio continues to play even after closing the app, so the only way to make the audio stop, is to force stop it completely through settings. I've cleared cache, Uninstalled and reinstalled several times. On data or wifi, issues persist."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"With tik tok joining, the app became worse. I check it daily and everyday it crashes. You can't see who did a duet with you anymore unless you're tagged. The reporting system is causing many many videos that follow community guide lines to be deleted. You can't look for sounds based off of genre anymore. It lags a lot more. It's a good app with it's ups and downs. I miss the qualities of the old musical.ly."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I don't like it one little bit, when tik tok, automatically puts soundtracks to videos I've made, W/O my permission because it's always contemporary, inappropriate and almost always some female vocalist with warbling tones, describing something which has NOTHING whatsoever, to do with the visual subject matter. But, the format, effects and some of the lenses are fantastic! And the privilege of being able to make semi- processed, amateur video clips, is something that , like cell phones.. hav"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I hate this app. It plays ads without having any other apps open. I want it to stop but it won't. I've deleted all the apps I have downloaded to try to get rid of it, but nothing works. The ad opens and playd while I'm on phone calls also. The craziest thing is, I didn't even download this stupid app... ever! I'm very unhappy and just want the barrage of ads to stop!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, I'm 100% fine with the app, I'm just experiencing an issue that as far as I can tell is nowhere else. Whenever I use a filter- any filter- even if I don't take a video, all videos stop loading. Just the video bits, the sounds load perfectly. This isn't like, a bandwidth problem- no longer how long I wait, the video portion and not the sound portion is broken. Just in case they use a filter to check for these, it's a bug/glitch/issue/error etc etc"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Edit: Down to one because it's incredibly glitchy. Fix the update. The algorithm sucks; I see the same 4 people over and over again despite trying to ""fix"" it. The search bar across the top of the screen is annoying and just takes up more space. The new draft page layout is irritating because you can't make another video with the same audio like you used to be able to right from the draft; now you've got to search for the audio that you were using every time you want to do a new take."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Yes it's great for memes. But uploading your own audio doesn't exist without extra steps, making a tik tok is 60 seconds, but uploading a video as one is only 59 seconds. From a creator's perspective, it'd be nice to have a more flexible and easier to understand editing user interface. Adding timed captions to match the audio can be hassle. Simple edits are easy. But to a novice who wants to make fun edits, it becomes finicky, time consuming, and frustrating."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love it. I've got a conversation going on geopolitics, and it's really cool having all information we need in short, amusing videos. Tik Tok is easy to use, intuitive and biased-free. One only thing you should keep in mind, though: It doesn't like pejorative words on #, so avoid using them lest you get your video flagged. Also, it considers nipples to be indecent, no matter if it's a man's or woman's."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"So, I love this app, trust me. Love finding new creators and seeing all the diversity across the wholw app. What I DON'T like, is the fact that all of a sudden when I'm filming a video, I hear NO SOUND whatsoever from the app. No playback from my voice, no added sound, AND the option for text-to-speech is just GONE. Weirder yet, if I actually POST the video, the sound is all there, just not when making it. All permissions are set up, I know it's not my phone... What do I do?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Tik tok is a great platform. Initially I thought it was only young girls dancing. However, there's a ton of other content: political views, sport, how to stuff, comedy, conversation starters, art. Such a variety. The app itself could have more features or be more intuitive on how to use it. I find what you can do with it a little limiting. But it's totally worth having and very entertaining."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I genuinely enjoy this app but the editing for videos for android users is practically impossible. I tried making a video recently and everytime I would try to edit the clips (make them shorter, or crop out certain sections) it wouldn't let me save the progress, or it would flat out crash. Meaning I would have to start all over. My partner, who also uses android, has had to delete the app and reinstall several times just to upload. The editor use to be so nice and convenient, but not anymore."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"SO FRUSTRATING!!! I'm trying to make a new post and the app is forcing music over my videos. It does not give me the option to not have audio, when I do try to just pick my own audio and try to edit it it has this other sound that's playing over it and I cannot get it to stop. I don't even know where the sound is coming from, and if I try to upload two different clips that I want in the same post it forces music over it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"ive had the app for a good while, and its been pretty fun, and not many problems. recently tiktok updated for me, and now the search bar only lets me look up users/sounds/tags. its frustrating, and not easy to use the app without being able to look up filters and videos. ive heard about a lot of people with this problem, but not many solutions, even after reporting the problem multiple times. everything is up to date on my side, so its a problem with tiktok. I almost don't want to use it"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's fine. I'm neutral on TikTok I've had no problems. I enjoy the straightforward GUI. I have no complaints. I would give it a higher rating but I simply choose other social media apps. I link with tiktok but it is just not my number one. although there's nothing wrong with it. it's A grade just my personal preference isn't tiktok RIGHT NOW. Might change. Many great features. Please try it ..
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Overall a good experience. I do have a lot of fun with it and I love seeing all the videos however Im a little fed up with the videos constantly freezing-doesn't matter if you close and re open the app, use WiFi or data,or uninstall and reinstall it still does it. Also I cannot get it to let me upload videos or sounds from my phone without crashing, gets to 23% and the whole app crashes. Needs better comment management. Seems like this app is starting to get very buggy."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall great! It's tik tok, I get my daily dose of small LGBTQ+ creators, D&D and more and I enjoy it. But a lot of the times I'll be watching a tik tok and when I get close the the end it just buffers, and I don't get to see the end. It keeps happening and is insanely annoying, cause I have to rewatch the whole thing after I restart the app or video. It's ruined my experience several times."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok is addicting. Highly addicting, but I love it. I've met so many great people on this app and learned a lot about random topics and myself. However, they don't make it clear on how to access certain features and the monetization is literally pennies. I would like to be able to create a playlist as well as have a stream key to go live on my laptop. I have reached out numerous of times and they keep saying ""be on the lookout"" without any follow up. Other than those gripes, it's a good app"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app is very fun but it is kind of problematic. It seems to kill your battery off. Even with power saver. As well as when trying to use an audio and it just doesn't. Lastly I tried putting a video that I didn't record with tiktok up but it was always out of sync. The video was slower than the audio. Apart from that the way if picking stuff for fyp is awesome and generally love the app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I love Tik Tok and have had it for a long time but now it glitches and lags a lot for me. It's frustrating when you're trying to film a video and it glitches in the middle of filming causing a delay in the finished product. It freezes for a good 5 seconds while scrolling through the For You Page too. I love this app but I just wish the glitches and lags could be fixed.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I normally love tiktok, but after the most recent update I can no longer go back to drafts and re-record clips. It just doesn't play the sound I chose at all, so I can't lipsync to any parts of videos I meant to come back to and re-record. I used to use this feature all the time by clicking on the ""adjust clips"" button, but now that's changed and the new feature is obviously buggy. Please fix this!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Just a quick question. I was trying to edit a video and found that the text to speech option comes and goes . I have the text to speech I just don't have the option to change the voice . And I've made sure the app is up to date so i just don't know why its not working. Oh and also it would be nice if everyone had the same editing features. Allowing them on some phones but not others gets really annoying. I'm just talking about tiktok's editing not getting other apps to edit clips .
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Until now I haven't had any serious issues with this app. However, currently it is asking me to update but upon closer look it is asking for financial information,my location,contacts,email addresses & many more personal information. It will not let me skip over the update either. I've had my share of viruses,malware & spyware in my day & this reeks of it. So with that user beware & always read the fine print!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Stupidly designed app! You open it, and it starts playing without warning!... At full volume! It constantly tries to guess what I would like but all I want is to not have it automatically play when opened. I hate this app and most of the content on the site. I only installed it to watch 1 video 1 time that a friend sent me. Don't waste your time on this, the interface is terrible! Less than 1 star if I could."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Previously would have rated a four or five stars but after the recent update, I lost the feature to favorite videos. I had entire playlists and videos favorited that I wanted to remember (some of which I had put there months ago) and now I'll not be able to find them again because they're buried in my liked videos. I could have lived with this if it wasn't that the feature isn't there at all and I can't even favorite videos anymore at all. Update: After a couple months the issue was fixed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like this app. However, I have an issue with favoriting videos. Whenever I try to organize my videos and put them into folders, the only option for me to do so is to unfavorite the video and favorite it again. This is where the issue comes and I've been taken to the way top of my favorites and would have to scroll all the way down again and repeat that process. It would be nice if you can hold down multiple videos and just place them in a folder you want."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Content is what you'd expect from a zombified Vine app. My biggest issue is the user interface/usability of the app. The video progress bar is so close to the home button that most of the time when you go to restart a video it refreshes the page and you never see that video again, it is honestly the most frustrating thing about using this app. Once you post a video you can't edit the captions at all, your only option is to delete the video and repost it. Needs work that's for sure 😂"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Try to make a TikTok and the sound I'm trying to use doesn't match up when I record. I've restarted my phone, cleared my cache, forced a stop, and have logged out and logged back in. It's frustrating when you go to use a sound and it starts playing super slow and you didn't slow down the sound. And then when it plays back it is so far off from your motions. I've tried with multiple sounds and it's doing the same thing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've never had a problem with Tik Tok until today. For some reason I can't access the sounds and videos I've put on favorite. The app keeps freezing and kicking me out. Also, every now and again when I click on profiles, I'm not able to see their followers or videos. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app multiple times now and these issue are still happening - it's extremely annoying."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Honestly it's a pretty nice platform but there are so many things that could improve it. Like the drafts not being deleted if you Uninstaller the app or use it on a different device. When editing drafts, it should keep you in the same place you saw the video in drafts. Being able to turn captions on and off at will. Stuff like that. Unless you're someone who doesn't are videos ig it doesn't matter. But there's just so many improvements that could be made in my opinion."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm not sure if this is a widespread issue or not. But apparently I'm experiencing a possible bug that when as soon as I would open up the app. It would just freeze up, no videos would start. i can scroll and interact with the platform, just can't watch any videos for whatever reason. No wifi issues or anything on my end. So I concluded that this may be a bug, and I hope this will get fixed soon."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app was working fine until 2 updates ago. Now, the screen is zoomed in too far, cropping a lot of the videos, and making the icons waaay too big. Glitches when trying to close app, takes many attempts to. The zoom even carries into my phone's desktop icons for a few seconds when the app finally closes. Frequently getting no internet connection error. Something is seriously wrong with it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love Tiktok. It's a great enough platform that despite some glitches I will keep it and continue to utilize it. However, we should still address these glitches. One being, I absolutely cannot save drafts. I can't even exit out of the app, go to another app for a few seconds then go back to Tiktok and keep a video. It will delete it, or say 'something went wrong.' I've lost many excellent videos in-production that just disappear. Two, my duets are always in slow motion. PLEASE UPDATE THE APP."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Tiktok will suddenly zoom in the UI on my Google Pixel 6 Pro and all of the icons/interface will become larger and it becomes hard to swipe up to close the app and read any subtitles or text on videos. It also makes the UI of the icons/clock at the top of my phone large as well. Started happening 2 days ago and it's ruining the experience.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Use the app everyday, always something interesting! Update. Tiktok, your response rate needs to be better. I have tried fixing the age which has somehow been input wrong and have been unable to to so. I have also reach out multiple time to address this, the way you've told me to reach out and address the issue, and still nothing has changed. This has also affected my experience and interaction on the app, which is a great let down. Here's to hoping that the problem is resolved..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Too many sponsored tiktoks, the video editing is laggy, and it changes your settings. I don't use the messages, because I get too much spam. I always get a pop-up of: ""We've changed it so that you can talk to everyone!"" even though I've MULTIPLE TIMES changed it so that I don't have my messages on. I have this off for a reason. There's been a few different examples of this, but that pop-up is the most frequent."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've had Tik Tok for pretty long, but recently there was another update (which is normal). TikTok had updated the generated captions which is actually really great! But not for me, I don't like the captions on my screen blocking most of the video. I know how to take the captions off but even if I turn the setting off, the captions will still show up. This is VERY annoying. hope they fix the problem"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Inability to change the download folder or to have it changed is a big culprit. Every app with vids or pictures saves in their own folder, but not TikTok, which puts everything in the camera folder. This is a pain and brings problems with automatic picture backup. Years and years people complain about this problem, but the devs don't seem to care."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Spyware. Uses advanced fingerprinting technology. My phone battery was always boiling. Extremely slow for something that plays mini video clips. It's doing a million things in the background. It's not free. It has ads to purchase ""stuff"". The minimum requirements are way off. Latest version still crashes my phone completely. THIS APP needs a 1000$ cell phone. 3GB of RAM is not nearly enough and Android 4.4 phones came with 1 maybe 2 GB (32 bit low end even back then)."

I'm still getting notifications for people I don't follow, things where I've hit ' not interested ', and things they've already sent me. Small creators have no chance on this app, unless you search them up, they barely get recognition. Edit: after having the app for almost a year, I can say I was wrong about it. Trying to navigate the settings is confusing for me, but I figured it out. My fyp is finally to my liking (the gay) but it still has some down sides. 1 to a 4"

I'm not sure if its just me that has this problem but tiktoks that I watch rarely ever fully load, and yet I am able to save the entirety of the video onto my phone within seconds? I just don't understand how its easier for the tiktok to be downloaded and saved onto my phone than it is to simply watch using the app. I'm tired of having to download a video just to watch the last 10 seconds that refuse to load. This must be fixed asap."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app was good until I couldn't post anymore due to the community guidelines. I was just using the outfit rating filter and I couldn't post anymore. Then a few days later I couldn't like anything. At the top a grey rectangle will say ""You're tapping to fast. Take a break! "". I thought that was completely fine at first. I stopped liking for a while and when I tried to like another video, it would say the same thing! I tried restarting my phone but that still wouldn't work! Tiktok, fix this."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok app has brought light to many home and creators round the world. The most amazing part of it is that it's user friendly, even the less experienced person can easily navigate and start exploring through the platform. And It's ability to record and then edit a particular video without looking for an external video editor or a professional to do it makes it more exceptional to every other social platform. I will love it if the management can add more effects and features in future."

Sharing and saving are two completely different actions and should not be part of the same menu, some of the most awful design out of any app I've ever used. UPDATE: I can't believe after literal months that this is still an issue, on top of that the auto generated captions setting is broke"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"TikTok is easily my favorite app, but there has been a problem that has developed over the past few months. The first second of a video almost always replays itself and it sounds like a CD skipping. Audio also falls out of sync easily in longer videos along with captions the further in you get. This isn't a device specific problem either, people from all over are having this problem."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Sound isn't syncing, it's completely off by a noticeable amount of seconds. So I can't create my own videos without it sounding/looking off. Plz fix. I have a Samsung s21 ultra, it was working great up until now. Watching videos aren't a problem they are syncing. Also the sound is slowed down/different pitch when recording, after the recording it sounds normal."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I really liked this app when I first started using it. I was able to upload videos then one day the videos stopped uploading. I tried contacting someone but it keeps telling me there's network issues try again later. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app several times and restarting my phone as well and I still can't upload videos. I'm starting to hate this app!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's alright. Pretty easy to use, and simple. The editing g is great, except you can't trim the videos within the app and need to download another editing app and reupload it. Another HUGE downfall is there is no way to see most recently added videos, so you're stuck watching outdated videos that have already received attention. I find it dull when you're trying to find users to interact with and duets, and makes it insanely difficult for new people trying to get attention."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I noticed that when I've been scrolling on my ""for you"" page for 30mins to 1hr or longer, all of a sudden, I'm not able to scroll/slide down anymore. It tends to happen at random times. When I try to scroll to the next video, the screen will buffer/load from the bottom of the video then it'll slide back to the current video that I was scrolling away from. This isn't the 1st time this occurred. It used to happen alot a couple months ago, but it stopped. Now, it's starting again. How do I fix it?"

But after you're done recording you can't go back and trime the video to proper to match you world 🌎 without erasing the whole thing and starting over. (1) proson found this helpful .

Honestly, though, ever since it became Tik Tok, it takes WAY too long to load, AND (!) sends me about 1000 notifications EVERY DAY!! I literally cannot deal with the CONSTANT vinrates and rings the app gives me, and not to mention the app is TERRIBLE about getting new viewers. Basically if you are a nobody with 0 Followers (like me), you are going to stay that way FOREVER. Don't get this app if you hast wasring time on notifications."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is great, i love it personally but it has sucked since the last update for one reason. Sometimes creators put word boxes on, and it's where the hashtags and @'s are, when you'd hold the screen to bookmark or save before, there used to be a box so you could still read what the words said in the video, but since the last update you cant. It's rather annoying and I've had to skip over many videos because I can't read it. Please fix this."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's really good, a great app to share videos with originals or editing. Also it has awesome tools for editing. One things it's too much slow, irritating when you really need to do something real quick. It seems like too many bugs, and it's bad for that. Otherwise Everything is fine, still gonna rethink before recommending it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is amazing .however I did have come glitches happen while using the app. For example when you press the button to record a video with a sound .the sound played while the camera is just stock in a position .and no. On the camera app this has never happened. This glitch has been occurring for about 1 month and a half. Sometimes it works but not often. I herded ever record video anyway but i do however post edited . And it works just fine. So it doesn't really brother me that........ I❤
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"For some reason random music will play over videos on my FYP and will continue playing if I pause the video. It does go away after a while but it's very annoying since it comes up so often. Also audio will delay when putting up a green-screen video. I've seen other people saying it happens as well, so we'd all appreciate it if these two issues could be fixed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok has repeatedly had issues with giving my front facing camera a blue screen for months. I usually end up deleting the app or clearing the cache, and it will work properly again, but this time, I can't log in. On the home screen, it won't let me click on anything. Then, when I try to get help on the tiktok support page, it just tries to send me to the app that I can't even get into."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very frusturated. Not Android friendly. I get so many ideas and get all excited! But when I get to record, it's not in sync and it keeps freezing the video. Don't get me started on how much it drains my battery. it's gone from 100 to 65 in 10 minutes just from me scrolling through it while walking to work. ugh. about to give up on this app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"TikTok has a very appealing concept and I like the short videos, but ... Fix your UI. The symbols burn into your screen, because every modern phone uses OLED. Why can't you move the UI a little bit over time, so the users won't notice, but also this doesn't happen. The content can be good, but you have to use this app for a long time. The live streams are 90% trashy clickbait. I would recommend using this app, if you do not use it often and want some simple content."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The one thing I really liked about the app features is the captions. They help me be focused and watch the videos without getting frustrated. Lately all I've been is frustrated because NONE of the videos on my fyp have captions, and I'm supposedly able to turn them on myself, but I don't have that function! I can't watch tiktoks for longer than a couple mins without getting a headache without the captions, please fix!"

Everytime I try to record a video either The timer, the record button or the filters stop working after 2 minutes of recording and working. I use a lot of transitions so I'm unable to record any videos. And every time I close the draft and try to edit it again(yk the good old turn off, turn on method) the sound is gone.

I restart my phone, turn it on and off, disconnect completely from the internet and then connect again and still, the app won't open. The only solution I can find is to uninstall the app and to install it again. As you may imagine, this is not very pleasant. Please fix this, TikTok."

However, its rather infuriating when you accidentally press ""do not reccomend"" when you're trying to send a friend a tiktok, it would be fantastic if there was an added feature to undo these remove/show less of these reccomendations. As at the time of writing this there is an issue where trying to select friends to send videos to will not have the ""send to"" red rectangular box and just a few times now I've un-reccomend videos I enjoy."

Although when sign out all your saved drafts are deleted all your hard work. And also you can't store videos you tool on the app in your phone unless you upload the video, which I find manipulative. Also becareful it's highly addictive"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Very addictive and would be a fantastic app if 98% of the content wasn't trash. Honestly, there are some very good content creators on here with some great/creative videos but they are overshadowed by the mass amount of bs videos that provide nothing more than cheap thrills (if it can even be called that). I've used this app for a long time but now it's time to leave all those trashy pointless videos behind."

I had to check my partners phone and watch the same videos to make sure, but on their device the captions show up and on mine they don't.

That was until I noticed it was constantly running in the background, even if I forced it to stop it would just open again. Which lead to serious battery usage on a relatively new phone.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Idk how this app got on my phone. I only discovered that it was installed as I was experiencing a rather high volume of adware -only of ""tik tok"" ads. These ads would pop up -AND PLAY AUDIO- while using the internet, using other apps, on my home screen, while texting, AND DURING PHONE CALLS!!! Funny, because it wasn't listed under installed/recent apps, and after some investigating and workarounds, was I finally able to uninstall it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Unistalled due to fake notifications from the app. If you swipe to close it, it opens up the App. This increases or adds value to their DAU (daily active users). These are fake messages, they're not from users. The thumbnail of the women are actually real users. They are usually the top user in the feed at the time the notification was sent. If there is one thing I hate, is aggressive adware from intrusive apps."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App has a major issue. After an unspecified period it tends to automatically lock out users for unknown reason(s) and delete their account(s) entirely only permitting them to establish a new account in Private setting. Indeed, this happened to me yesterday (06/23/2022). This is somewhat irritating and I advise to think carefully before risking an experience similar to or exactly like mine."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The android version of this app lacks many things the iPhone version has. Some filters/video effects don't work, dark mode and the ability to toggle captions on/off is gone. Captions used to be able to be toggled but that changed after an update. I don't understand why but it's very annoying. It's clear that tiktok doesn't even try to fix the Android version of their app. Pathetic. There's no excuse for high-end androids to not have the same features as iPhones."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok is a lot of fun actually. At first I didn't get it, but love the videos and the algorithm to find what you like. The only problem is making videos. I'd like to be able to splice certain parts of a video so I don't have to go and do it in another app. It would also be nice if the songs or sounds weren't just 9 sec, 11 sec, 15, sec, etc. I'd like more to a song because my video is longer, but it doesn't want to be like that so it is just frustrating. It's nice, just fix the editing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"In the past two weeks, when I try to duet or use a sound, the audio is either playing slower while recording, which unsyncs my video, or it plays at normal speed but when playing back to review, my video starts to slow down towards the end causing it to unsync. I have cleared my cash, Force stop, and reinstalled the app twice. Nothing improves it and so I'm left with not creating any videos at all because it's too frustrating."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have a galaxy s10, I know it's not the newest of phones by far but there are still so many things I cannot use on this app due to it being unsupported. It could be the simplest of things too, but I honestly believe it's because alot of them are created on IOS so that does probably make a difference. My auto captions also fail to work everytime there's a new update and that's a bit bothersome. Otherwise the app isn't too bad"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I cannot back out of the app cleanly. My sister will text me multiple tik tok links, and the only way to open them is with the tik tok app. Even then, sometimes it gives you a totally different Tik Tok before the one linked. When I try to back out and get back to the messages app, Tik Tok just gives me another Tik Tok. It's a scummy way to try to force users into engagement and boost watch time. I'm surprised this kind of ""feature"" is allowed on apps in the Play store."

I'm trying to like some videos, but it keeps telling me, ""You're tapping too fast. Take a break!""

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Like the app, but pissed that they took away the option to add your own music from your music library. The song selection that users are now forced to choose from isn't the best, so the developers have effectively blunted the usefulness and enjoyability of this app by stripping out a really convenient feature. Otherwise, the app is fine."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I really love tiktok as a platform to share and connect but these audio issues and glitches are a huge problem that never seems to get resolved. I mostly do music duets and the audio delay and sound level issues are absolutely ridiculous. I have reported this issue many times with no results, and the only thing that helps is to uninstall then reinstall the app - this only works for the first couple of duets, then it goes back to the issues! Also you should remove the auto volume adjustment."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"So you updated the app but didn't add a fade away feature for the onscreen controls/buttons? They should fade out like after a few seconds so that I have the whole screen for viewing without impediments... They are constantly in the way of the content I'm trying to view. A lot of the times they block out portions of what I'm supposed to be seeing. Also, the app needs a specialized volume control so that I can mute or turn down the audio for the app and not my entire device."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This apps pretty good for the most part, I just don't like it when I spend 2 hours putting cosplay makeup on just for tik tok to remove it. I put in the captions that its just makeup, but it doesn't matter. If one person gets offended by your video and they report it, then it will be removed. And sometimes the app can be really slow and laggy oof but overall its a good app"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My previous review detailed an issue with the spam filter locking my account and since then, this seems to have resolved! There's lots of talk about new issues with the algorithm and the ability to block certain sounds/creators/trends, but I don't seem to be having any problems in that regard at this time, thankfully. Aside from the occasional temporary connection error with no explanation, I'm not experiencing any significant issues. Good stuff :)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app, does exactly what it's supposed to! HOWEVER. I kept getting a little popup on my notification screen, no logo, just an empty block. when i tried to swipe it away it stayed there. Upon further investigation (pressing down on the notif for a few seconds) i found out it was from tik tok, i uninstalled the app out of a suspision tik tok could MONITOR what i was viewing/consuming to ""better my content"". No apps, especially one with loads of young people, should have any kind of monitoring."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. But I wrote a review not too long ago talking about how whenever I try to send a TikTok video to Snapchat, it won't let me send a video longer than 10 seconds as a snap. I was actually able to send any video, regardless of length, as a snap for a while and I was so stoked about that. But this last update, it went back to doing that and it's so annoying. I don't know if this is on your end or on Snapchat's end, but it's still annoying as hell. Please fix this! 😁"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So, all of the sudden, 1 lost all the enhanced video editing. All I can do is the basics like it used to be. I tried a reinstall, nada. I don't know if it's due to my new Galaxy ultra 23 the recent updates, but it is superbly frustrating. Dropped to 1 star for not letting me change the displayed name. I DO NOT want my real name plastered all over tiktok. Make it optional!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"first i would like to start off with i have an android and it works great. to all those complaining about lag on android, most apps in the play store run in back ground to help open apps faster. that takes away from your phone's processing RAM. secondly the camera issue is not based on app as the camera is a totally different function of your phone all together. third not all platforms are created equally. if they were an xbox game could work on a playstation. prime example fallout all of them."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"App otherwise works fine, but for the past few days whenever I like a video it immediately disappears from my likes. Clearing cache, reinstalling, restarting phone, etc have not fixed this. Seems to be a long standing issue as when searched online, numerous other people have complained about the same issue for over a year. Doesn't look like an issue on the user end, but on the servers end."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love the app, but all of a sudden I not longer have the text to speech option, I used to have it and did a few videos with it before but now it's gone. I've updated and reinstalled and cleared cache but it doesn't work. I did do it with a different phone than I have now but it was an upgrade not a downgrade so you'd think it'd work with a newer phone...I have the galaxy s22 ultra. Any suggestions or help? This also makes it so I don't get any of the fun voice changers. I'd love to use them."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"While it might seem enticing at first, after a while the content becomes repetitive and boring. The algorithm, similarly to YouTube, learns over time what you like and what you hate and keeps proposing content from both side of the spectrum as after all engagement is engagement, doesn't matter if positive or negative. What the algorithm doesn't understand is that people like different things in different moments and seeing the same type of content over and over just becomes boring."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Whatever new ""edit clips"" option they put in is absolute garbage. I do like the easier GUI, but everytime I try to edit clips or move around the sound, it glitches and won't save properly. This glitch is also a really big problem with editing text. Everytime I go to change the duration of a text in the new interface and hit save the text ends up being off the screen and there's two copies of it for some reason. I can see that it tried to copy capcut but it needs to be way better."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The ability to connect and communication is great. Though the app has loads of bugs that would be easy to fix, if they cared. TikTok has the worst customer service I ve ever seen in my life. They ignore most support requests, and those that they do respond to they mess with you over and over again, to try to get it you to give up asking for support that you are owed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Half the time, it won't let me connect. Keeps telling me to retry. Sometimes when I shut it off, the audio continues to play. I have friends with the same issues, so its not on my end. Even with the app fully shut down and off it keeps running. Have to power my phone down to disconnect completely. Makes you wonder what all is really going on in the app...information stealling??? I mean I turn it off and it continues to run..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love your app! It's helped me filter in more fans for my work. My only complaint is storage options! I use an Android and have an SD card inserted. I illustrate a lot. When I make videos, they take up a lot of space. You should consider making it available to change storage options, as some apps like gif makers and ""youcut"" have done! I don't mind manually moving my videos, but having that option would be easier!"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I love the app and it is so much fun. but it gets really frustrating when I am rewatching my drafts and I have to click cancel at least 10 times. or when I try and click anything I have to click it multiple time in order to get it to work. most the time it doesn't work at all. I don't like writing bad reviews but when I have used this app for years and never had this problem until recently. it really bugs me. idk if the whole system is down or just me.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The only things I hope they change is the voice changer so it works the same way as adding the visual effects in editing that you can choose when it happens & make it dip in & out (for if you want to have multiple different sounding people having a conversation). Also have a contact lense effect that you can just choose the colour & it stays cus the waving hand/blinking ones can be super annoying to maintain for long videos (needs more colours!) Other then that, the updates have been great!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I spend most of my day on this app, and it's great. I have 2 issues. First one is dark mode. I've tried everything. Nothing works. Secondly, I get none of the new features for weeks. The thing where you hold 2 fingers on the screen for the UI to dissappear is a good example. It did not work for months after it was released. I checked my app store everyday until I got it. And it wasn't my phone, my sister has the same one and she got it way sooner than I did."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Fun concept, but the search function is so bad! it's a nightmare to try to find anything new. the app is a fun concept, but it should be more user friendly. it would be great if there was more customisation of the ""for you"" feed possible such as being able to turn off recommendations based on location. trust me, the locals here are not funny or interesting, please stop showing me their videos. i click ""not interested"" on all of them but they keep showing up :/ i'm only here for cosplay"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"ADDICTIVE APP!!! New feature idea, can you make it where we can scroll through the videos we've been sent in the app and not miss the ACTUAL text messages that are in between? My husband sends me a ton of tiktoks in the app itself and sometimes sends a message along with them but when I'm scrolling through them en masse, I miss the messages because the app doesn't stop for them while I'm scrolling through the videos. Please fix? Thanks! 🥰"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The first few minutes of this app are fun. As the algorithm gets more accustomed to what you like. But from there, it's a way to spiral. I used to have to physically pry my phone away so I wasn't sucked into more videos. It's a dangerous app which can waste your time. I know it isn't a fault of the app necessarily, but the fact that short based content has even taken over YouTube is a little bit scary. I just hate the format."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm a regular content creator with a decent following. I love making videos, but lately I've had a technical issue with the app. Everytime I record audio there's a cracking/static noise at the end of the clip. Then even when I try to cut out the cracking noise at the end of the clip when I add a sound for the background, it starts to distort the audio at random times. It makes recording and editing videos frustrating when this app issue compromises the quality of your video content."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoy this app, a lot. But when I put my videos into their folders/playlisy thing and the video is removed or taken down by the creator, it leaves a grey picture saying the video has been removed, and it stays there, and it won't let me click more than one to take them out of my folder. Instead it makes me click each on individually to delete it then makes me go all the way back to delete the other ones. Which is annoying."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Please just request a quick question.I was trying to edit a video and I found out that there is no option to change text to speech only audio. A l've made sure the app is up to date so I don't know why it's not working. Oh and it would also be nice if everyone had the same editing features. Allowing them on one phone but not other gets really annoying. I am only talking about TikTok editing which other apps can't find to edit clips. My account @aftab.mahar786
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is the highest I can rate tiktok right now. Why? Because of the amount of lag whenever u create a video. For example: I just got out of Twitter (X) and I went to tiktok and create a video about it. Tiktok literally closes the app completely till my screen is fully black. Or sometimes if that doesn't happen, it lags so badly that u can barely use the app. Even when u repost videos it doesn't show all the videos you've reposted. No matter how much you've reopened the app doesn't work."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I give it two stars. One for the effects like reality ripple and one for the ai effect. But, It has problems... I tried using the studio feature to make a short video, first I spent hours learning how to edit, add effects, then it froze up. I lost all my work. Gave it another chance, spent so much time on adding effects to my minute long clip, and went to save it as a draft, it went to video limbo. NEVER SAVED IT!!! Boo hiss!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I seem to have a lot of lagging. It pops up and says i have no internet... even though i do! No matter if its on 5G or wifi. I find this to be uber annoying. And im tired of seeing ads! And i wish it actually listened when i clicked ""not interested"" It bugs when the same junk keeps popping up. Id also like it if after 2 plays to the video it automatically scrolls to the next one or at least pauses and doesnt continue to play the same thing after a couple watches. Aside from this, its a fun app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Audio doubles when you go to upload a video and the app doesn't sync properly. I don't get notifications for all comments, i don't get notifications for most likes. On desktop there's a different number of followers and likes than mobile. The desktop version syncs better, but even so...you can't upload on desktop anymore. There's always a problem when it comes to being a creator."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This is a great app where you can express yourself & have fun!! However, there's 2 problems I've had recently. When I make a video w/ multiple clips, it looks normal & fine when I'm editing it but once it's posted, I see that it lags rlly badly. So the video goes good for the first few seconds then it freezes & when the sound ends, the clips start to show up but instead, they are sped up. Plz fix this issue. I've had it happen w/ 3 tiktoks already:/ That rlly upsets me:("
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a really good app, but with some odd limitations, which kind of need to be fixed. 1: You cant trim your videos, sure there's a timer, but there's almost no way you can count out the exact amount of seconds you're going to need, it would be easier with trim. 2: If you see a video that says, ""duetthis"" you can't see if anyone has duetted it, and you cant search for a specific video, only hashtags. 3: you can't see when a video was posted."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Personally, I think this app is great. The algorithm figures out what you like and dislike so you end up with videos that will interest you. You can use the app for just entertainment purposes or you can create content and make a lifestyle out of the app. There are different sides of tiktok from books, cooking, dance, football and much more! There are some downfalls to the app including the fact that you may end up looking track of time. Overall really recommend the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's good app to use and I'm having great experience using it, but tiktok putting my videos on ""this video is not eligible for foryou page"" I'm a digital creator and been making videos for every platform using copyright free content from certain websites and there is nothing wrong with it in any other social media platforms but I'm having this issue that tiktok algorithm thinks that I'm not using original footages and videos please sort this out . thank you."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"LIITERALLY THE SAME ISSUE STARTED OFF WELL. . .So, basically, I can't sign up or anything because when I load up the app and I'm met with a screen asking ke to log in or create an account, no matter where I tap on my screen, it won't register. I've restarted the app, my phone, uninstalled and re-downloaded it, nothing works. I literaly can't tap on anything, no other app has this problem, and I personally have never seen anything like this. So yeah, 1 star because it is quite literally unusable."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love tiktok so much even though I waste so much time herex) it does has a bad reputation especially in my country but there is so much useful content here, and it's just that people don't understand that it's all about algorithms and the content that pops up is based on your own interests. Over all I prefer it more than other social media apps."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I didn't have any issues with this app. Audio would work great, and I didn't have any issues, until the update happened. Once the update happened, the audios are slowed down when you go to record a video, and the video that you just did, isn't in sync with the audio. I can't record videos without this issue happening. I have even uninstalled it and reinstalled it, and it still didn't fix it. Please fix this issue!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I think its one of the best apps in terms of entertainment, but its got two flaws that are driving me crazy: 1. The ads are completely irrelevant to me. For example, I was getting makeup ads for like 3 weeks straight. No idea why since I don't follow any beauty brands or creators. 2. Everytime I close it, I get a message from my phone saying ""Tik Tok is draining your battery"", so I have to Force Close it. This seems shady (why is it still running?) & drains my battery."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's great and stuff but it keeps on freezing the videos near the end. I cleared cash and data, unistalled and Reinstalled, check if it had the latest update, skipped the video and then go back and nope, it freezes agian at the same time/ moment it did last time. and it's annoying having to do this multiple times and watching a long video only to have it freeze, do all of that, and watch it aall over and it still freezes. And it happens to other videos! What do I do?!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"So I enjoy the app - it's entertaining but I don't like that I don't have the same editing features as iPhones. Adding voice effects over videos I'm editing? Don't have that feature. When I try to use a sound using multiple videos that I didn't record through the app, I can't edit the amount of time each video clip plays over the sound without using the auto sync. Overall good app, but it would be better if iphones and Androids didn't have different features."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app worked great, until recently. Can't update it, can't record videos without the app lagging, can't add text without it dissapearing, went do uninstall and reinstall so it would auto update and now I can't install the app again. One of my accounts dissapeared and I can't change the connected phone number without having the phone. But if I had the connected phone, I wouldn't need to change it. So many bugs and crashes and nothing to do about it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I dont know the proper words for it, but the icons for the home button and the + in the center have burned into my screen.. I was reading on a off white screen and thought it was part of the book but after looking and thinking about how if TVs or monitors are left on blue or anything too long it can keep a faded image. I'm unsure if this is because of particular colors or what, but it's worth keeping note of. Right now they are a faint red that I can only see on light colors but yeah.. sucks."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is great and all, but that was till I got a new phone(Samsung 22+). It always says I'm offline and need so many tries to like, comment, or even just scroll. I've checked other apps, but this is the one one having problems 😒 I have disconnected from the wifi and turned it back on, deleted the app(just gets worst everytime), and reinstall, as well as my use my data. However, nothing works. Not to mention, the recording doesn't always work. I'd love it if someone has a solution to fix this"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"App has had alot of glitches lately. Particularly when it comes to sound. Most recently, sou d is out of synch with the person talking. You can see their lips saying something different than what the audio is. Audio for duet videos is bring cut. You can't get any sound from the video you duet not matter what. The option to use the original audio is grayed out and muted. These problems have been around for months. Despite updates they still haven't been fixe"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I love the app! Spend hours on it. One issue I'm having is when I'm recording and lip syncing to a song. The lip sync is laggy n foesnt line up with the words. I find it better to use my camera on my actual phone and then upload the lip sync video that way. I tried clearing the cache n updating the app and my device. Nothing has worked so it must be an in-app issue besides that i lobe this app! I just can't post much because of that glitch and lag
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing, however l did some glitches happen while using the app . For example, when you press the button to record a video with a sound plays while the camera is just stuck in a position, and no, on the camera app this has never happened. This glitch has been occurring for about 1 month and a half. Sometimes it works but I do however post edits, and it works just fine, so it doesn't really bother me that 1 person found this helpful"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,honestly TikTok used to be really good but now it's just trash. it won't load my notifications at all. I've even tried restarting my phone and deleting and reinstalling the app but it doesn't work. it also won't let me post anything anymore and it freezes all the time. when it does freeze and I go out of the app the sound keeps playing and it doesn't stop for a few minutes. I'm actually really disappointed by this. please fix it.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is absolutely terrible. Whenever I open a link to a tik tok video I have to push the back button an average of 10 times before I get to the video I actually clicked on. I turned off all notifications but still receive at least 5 a day. Reported this problem, got a message back requesting screenshots, however after opening this message once it was nowhere to be found again so I could not send them the screenshots. Have just deleted the app after receiving *yet again* notifications."

Can I please get somebody from your team to look at the issue ASAP. I would highly appreciate it!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's brilliant. Once you start liking and engaging the algorithm works better and better. Micro video has been around for years but tik tok and it' algorithm are really entertaining. Great experience and I've been enjoying it a lot. I'm 31 and told my girlfriend she was a teenager for using it before I gave it a go. But it is genuinely entertaining. Update: 3 years later. I am now single because of Tik Tok.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Beware Burn-in! This is an app with overall highly enjoyable and addictive content. It is very easy to spend hours watching video after video, but this can and will lead to screen burn-in that is often not covered by your device warranty. TikTok, you lost two stars for not allowing the option to hide the icons at the bottom and right of the screen."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Cons: - App UI was a bit hard to understand at first - Responding to a specific message in the chat automatically jumps to the end of the conversation so I have to scroll back up after each response that I make which is unnecessary and obstructive. - Videos can be saved in only one collection at a time. - I get alerts for old videos of followed accounts Pros: - The FYP is surprisingly close to my interests most of the time which is very satisfying. - Doesn't take long to get used to the UI.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Tik Tok is a great social media app. But one thing that they need to quickly change is having certain effects not being available on Android devices. For example, the green screen effect is not available but that is one of the most used effects on there for trends and video creation in general. It is not fair that people do not have a chance to use the app at its full potential."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App features are inaccessible. For several months after the new voice filters came out I didn't have them. Then I finally got them, and then they disappeared again along with the text-to-speech effects. So sick of this app constantly breaking and features just disappearing. I've already tried updating, making sure my phone is updated, etc."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Hi! I'd like to report a new issue. Whenever I scroll and watch a new TikTok, it shows I reposted the video even though I didn't press ANY button on my screen. It's bizarre and also a little stressful, because I don't know whether it ACTUALLY reposts anything I wouldn't approve of!! Hope this glitch gets detected and fixed soon. It's taking away from the (usually pleasant) experience of using the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like this app it's cool but I just don't like when you save your videos in your drafts and everytime you click on one then you have to go back to the start, that's super annoying for me and I hope it changes because it's just waste of time (no offense). It would be better if you just had to swipe up for them like when you post a video. But the good thing is that you can do the drafts without wifi and that's the BEST thing about that app so I love it. But however a great app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love tiktok, I've been on it since musically. But, recently, the app has been telling me that I have no internet (I have full bars). I'm confused about why this is. It's honestly getting pretty dang annoying. Not only this, but the toxicity on the app is horrible. But some stuff is informative, great, and pretty funny. Overall, it's a good app to connect with people."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Somewhat buggy in terms of uploading. Sometimes I'll spend 1hr to make sure my captions are right only for the TikTok to say ""too many characters"" on screen across my face. On top of that, after all that, I'd then have to worry about if it'll upload, which many times it doesn't but plot-twist, it also doesn't upload to the drafts either, so it's just lost forever. Honestly, I'm probably just gonna take a break of frustration."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I hate this app but it technically does what it's supposed to do. The algorithm usually works really well to show you videos that are relevant to your interests. It's a complete time waster and hours will pass during use. I took one star off because I'm not quite sure how the fyp is so accurate. Are they reading my texts, tracking my location? Also I'm pretty sure they have purposely 'censored' the fyp so it wouldn't show coverage of a certain event."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It's very addictive and it's honestly so draining. I love the app but it takes up so much of my time because of how addictive it is. And there's also so many videos I've seen that I really wish I didn't. Like there are so many gory videos that shouldn't be available to kids. Some accounts are filled with animals being killed and honestly it's horrible. Please do better. Delete things that need to be deleted. And my screen constantly just turns black and I have to close and re open the app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Edit: The bug has been fixed and has been working wonderfully! I've been on this app for some time now and it's great. You can watch for hours on end and it's a real time killer. The one thing that made me take those stars off was that for the past few weeks I cant open any of the tiktoks my friends send me. And when I try to go to the fyp for the people I'm following, it doesn't open up. Also when I try to search things, it kicks me out. I'll give back the stars once it's fixed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the app. It's mostly easy to use. I do have a couple suggestions tho and didn't know where else to go to suggest them but 1. It would be awesome if we could follow more than 10k ppl on tick tock. 2. When duetting/stitching, it would be cool if we could adjust the time to make the vid longer if we wanted to do something really cool on a duet. And 3 I need a way to change my phone number without confirming it with my old phone(because i busted it). Thank you."

I get the big screen with the tt logo and then, I'm in my homescreen again without access to the app. I don't particularly need tt, but it's nice for passing short periods of time (f.e. busrides etc.) and it's pretty annyoing that it just doesn't work most of the time for no apparent reason."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I liked making videos on here for me and my friends to enjoy the only problem was it never let me make a clear video. It would always do this weird speed up thing, and then if I was lipsinging, I would be off even tho I know the song!! I've tried everything to fix it, but it doesn't work 😕. So I always just make edits with my pictures. I also can't get other videos about other things it's always the SAME 5 FRICKING CATOGORYS!!!! The pov, the bad news, zodiac signs, and some show over a game!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"For some reason, when I liked a certain video in a different language, my fyp started to add more of it, even tho i only liked 1 video, but after that, it started glitching and not showing my followings and followers. After re-installing it, the e-mail registration also didn't work. These types of things don't happen often, but it's not like they don't, so think before downloading TikTok"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App keeps crashing randomly, sometimes I open the app and it instantly shuts down other times I can use it for a while. Tried all the things that so called tech support suggested before reaching out to them. Once I did reach out to them and told them that I had tried all the things they said to try all the things and send screen recording. The problem is it happens randomly. I can't constantly screen record."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app on its own is great, I love to watch videos on it. But I have 2 main problems I have to talk about. The first being, I cannot open tik tok. My friend and I always send each other's links and sometimes tik tok won't let me open it and I have to reinstall. The second problem is the algorithm. I have seen some slideshows where naked woman are hidden. Those are the most important problems I have."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This is a fun app that allows creative minds to make wonderful short works of art. There's some trouble when it comes to moderators monitoring content. The clarity of what does and does not violate the rules and regulations for content is questionable. There are certain features are not always available cross all devices. But otherwise it is a great app and I love using it. There's also no way of editing a video or its description after it is posted which can be annoying. Otherwise it's very fun
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Love the app, but I dont like the latest update. When creators would put text in the video that was covered up by TikTok's video text, I could long press on the video to bring up a pop up menu so I could see it. Now, it still brings up the menu, but it brings it up from the bottom and covers most of the screen. Is there an option to disable the text in the bottom left of the video so I can see what the creator is putting there? It's really annoying."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I RARELY have issues. Any ""unstable connections"" are fixed with a wifi reboot, and that doesn't happen often. Only thing I'd like to see included is the ability to edit a comment instead of having to copy & delete to fix. Autocorrect gets the best of us sometimes. ALSO I saw a review about accidently refreshing and losing your video. IN SETTINGS YOU CAN SEE THE VIDEOS YOUVE SEEN, and also see every video you made a comment on. 😀"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is so fun! Its a fun way to express yourself and be you. There are snipits of music clips, funny sounds, ect. You can even make ur own sound! With these clips you can record videos in many ways. No hands, transitions, slow mos, ect. You can also add special effects and edit your videos. Tik Tok is simple and very easy to use. But yet so fun and time consuming. Sometimes there are bugs and glitches, but thats on every app. The only real big problom is that it takes up SO much storage."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is pretty good, it seems fair in letting even brand new people be able to get views on their tiktoks, but there's a weird pick and choose aspect, where some users get new features and others don't. Like, the voice effects, I have a few, but ofc I don't have the Trickster one or any other popular effect which sucks. It'd be cool if, no matter what phone you have, that EVERY use gets access to new features."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Causing screen burn!!! Be careful using it!! Have had this for a little over a year now and noticed the bottom row of buttons is now burning into my screen and cannot be fixed without replacing the screen. I love the app but they need to fix this!! A quick Google search will show you it doesn't matter what phone you have they will all end up with it eventually if you use the app
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My impression with tick tock was somewhat negative because of all the bad publicity. I had a money making app that gave me points for using TikTok and honestly I really like it! It's fun to watch the videos and it's easy to use! I know there can be challenges on there that shouldn't be done by anyone, but if you are mature enough you will see that those challenges are stupid!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"A great app. Love it, however it gets annoying that sometimes I'll duet someone, and it will distort/lag/unsync the duetted video, when there is a filter/effect/sound/etc that I find that I like/want to try I won't have it for some reason, and I can't have a lot of features that other users have (Ai Manga, Toggle for Closed captions, dark mode, some voice effects, ect.) And it is very annoying. Sometimes the like mechanics lag and tell you you can't like the video 5 videos down. 3 stars."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"everything's great besides few things that seriously piss me off. the fyp problem, in the last months or even half a year already i started to get more videos i don't usually watch & not even related. after clicking multiple times ""not interesed"" and explaining the problem in help page it did work for a while (a week or so) but came back eventually after more updates, pls fix that. and also more of my personal issue, changing the aesthetics of interface every few months, just annoys me."

A few days later the videos will go back to my original cover, but a few hours later, it'll change again and its annoying because I want my viewers to know what the videos are about if they are browsing my page. Also, everytime I'm editing a video, and I'm nearly done, the app crashes, forcing me to do the video all over again."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I would just give it zero stars but you can't do that so it's only one star because the reason why is because of the community guidelines some of them are dumb and also removing sounds cuz of ""copyright"" is just retarded otherwise I still do like the app but I'm still giving you one star cuz if you're going to have community guidelines just have it for removing bad videos that show naughty things sooooo yea have a great day"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's 4 stars because, for some reason, you can't access dark mode on an Android. It's so stupid because I know it's possible because I keep getting a glitch where it switches to dark mode. You know it's possible, so why not just give us dark mode? It's so irritating."

Since the latest update, I am not able to view my favorites or collections, and only get a message saying ""Your favorites/Collections Will Appear Here."" While still saying I have a ton of both. When I choose ""not Interested"" on many videos regarding the same topic, I continue to see them at the same rate as always, which becomes Very frustrating."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I think it is a really fun way to see what everyone else is doing from different countries and knowing about other people's culture. Being able to text through the app and send videos, is also a fun and easy way to connect with friends. Apart from all the good things, I tend to spend a lot of time lazing around watching it all day, which makes me feel unmotivated. Besides this, I haven't had issues with the app so far, just how I use it."

It was fine for a while, everything was easy to navigate, and the things people posted were fun to watch. But they don't value your blocked terms. I have a lot of sensory issues, so asmr is not something I would want to come across. However, I get more asmr videos and livestreams now that I did put those terms onto my blocked term list. It is extremely aggravating, and even if I click not interested, they still come up. 0/10, just disgusting."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Please just request a quick question. I was trying to edit a video and I found out that there is no option to change text to speech only audio. And I've made sure the app is up to date so I don't know why it's not working. Oh and it would also be nice if everyone had the same editing features.

TikTok may delete your video marking it as violation and adding a strike in your account and you can see same video getting thousands of views on other accounts. In last three months TikTok freeze my account 2 times and shadowbanned my account 2 times. It's so sad to see your views and likes going down."

There is a lot of toxicity on this app so be prepared also people sometimes sneak in adult videos into the app so be ready for that too. Not to mention some vids are offensive or scary so if you get this app I would advise for you to be very very careful while on."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, don't get me wrong, but the censorship is awful. They say they do everything to keep this app for kids and to keep it safe, and yet, there's people who are so very discriminatory and problematic who get to stay on the platform. While the people who speak up about it get warned or banned. It's absolutely stupid. This app allows bad people to spread that bad stuff, and yet you call it a safe platform. Ban the ones who are bad, instead of the ones trying to protect others."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I once really enjoyed this app. Unfortunately, it has changed greatly since I first downloaded it. The TikTok shop and other ads to buy things have taken over. I end up with 3 to 4 ads in a row before I see a video. It's become ridiculous. The suggested accounts are out of control also. They show up in the suggested accounts section along with under those accounts I already follow. Overkill! I'm irritated deleting massive amounts of them from under accounts I follow!!"

I love the LIVE videos and I'm really looking forward to when I have enough followers to actually be able to go LIVE! I marked it 1 star down as I find the app isn't as user friendly as it should be. I find it hard to find things like how to delete a video & other things. Well, of course, it is EASY to find once you know where to look. A quick YouTube video is instantly helpful."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It really has some issues. Yes, it's entertaining and it's influencing millions, but it has several problems. To being, the reporting/blocking system is hidden behind the ""share"" icon. It took me a while to find that out. It has a very bad problem with people stealing content. A big issue is when people just repost a video with it being flipped, and confirmed content creators do this so they profit off of othef people's work. It's not just on timtok. Look at snolerwolf I wjsh I could say more."

While it may be popular and entertaining for some, I can't ignore the fact that it's become a breeding ground for provoking and disturbing content.

If you wanna get a good laugh but have the app stuck in your brain your whole life, and corrupt your daily life to post stuff that takes a long time to make while getting 5 views every video you make.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It would be nice if tik tok added a couple of more features for those of us who maybe dont want to see anorexic creators and their want to be anorexic fans.

I've also recently had a problem while scrolling through tiktok a video freezes and the previous audio plays but I just swipe up and down then a couple minutes later it happens again I'm not sure what the reason is since everything has been just fine until this point. You can also have multiple accounts that are easy to access without typing in the password each time.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Don't believe the news!!! You can absolutely control what this App does and doesn't have access to on your phone. They don't have to have your precise location or access to your contacts and such to work effectively. You can view vids and post vids without giving this app all the premssions it requests. The permissions it asks for is to give you a better (more streamlined) experience. If you choose to grant the app permissions you can change that at any time within the settings.

I would really like it if we'd be able to record 3-5 minute long videos just so that we wouldn't have to hear ""Come back for part 2"" on our For You Page. 2.

If you value your personal information and data (which you should) please uninstall."

My search bar doesn't have the part where you can search videos, captions or top videos anymore and I can't find anything I want! It only has sounds, hashtags, or users. I have the latest version and already deleted and redownloaded it but no. I'm so tired of this."

If I watch with earbuds perfect without I'm off. It wasn't like that before I posted. I've done everything - cleared cache ensure up to date app, uninstalled and reinstalled app. This has happened before now after posting original draft disappears after posting and now post is terrible. Have to remake. What is the issue from draft to posting?"

Certain videos will allow me to share, but it's like 1 of 500 videos; not even exaggerating). There's 2 options, either share it with friends through text and through social media, or share with friends. But you better be fast bc after you save it, it pops up and dissappears within 1 second. Before this started happening, I loved tik tok, but now i barely want to go on because I can't share things."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I love the app very much but recently I've been liking videos and they would pop up in my liked videos but if I refresh or leave and come back then the video would not save there.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's fun but I wish there was a feature to have folders in your saves cause I have audios from back in 2016 and even after going back and deleting a bunch I still have to scroll forever and I don't even remember half the audios I saved. And this is bad because I am a cosplayer and I have multiple ideas for multiple of my characters so it's hard to find the right audios most the time. So if I could do folders it would save my life. It could also go for favorited videos too! It would be awesome!!

It's puting everyone into creativity and also allowing us to show up in different styles and locations. Honestly TikTok is really keeping us busy every day and night, am recommending TikTok to more of my friends and family members. I urge you owners of TikTok to keep up the good work because people are happy using the app. Thanks for such a good app. Am happy for you."

I continue to promote videos, and they continue to reject. I upload original work, & they continue to mute. Filed claims with no word for weeks. Went from my favorite app to most discouraging. I thought I found my break through app. Hopefully, there can be restoration to our relationship. I am currently deleting bc of error on default font desc. not working. Be back in a few day with 🤞🏼"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I'm going to be honest... If I can't opt out of these aggressive tiktok shop promo vids I'm sticking with YouTube shorts.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ever since a recent update, the app has been horribly broken. I keep getting age restricted on videos, even tho I have literally never had this feature turned on. I've updated, turned it on then turned it off, done everything I can think of, but it still keeps happening. And ofc there's no support so nothing I can. Honestly about to uninstall the app completely at this point, it's so annoying."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Tiktok is really starting to become dumb. They got rid of all the good songs and is having beef with umg sum like that.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, it's pretty frustrating that tiktok still won't give me the slides option. I've already updated the app three times, and it still won't give me the option. Tiktok is also very on and off with photo mode for me as well. For example, I'll go to make a video and the photo mode will be there but the next time I go to make a video it's not there."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is an amazing app where everyone has the opportunity to share their talents, stories, and encouragement for one's well-being."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love tik tok. I also am super thrilled about the favorites button being added to videos. The only thing I'd ask for from the app is the ability to easily go see your video history that you've watched. I tend to refresh the page alot and lose a video I wanted to save so having the history tab on your profiles would help prevent that in my opinion.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Was a bit of a downer on it for a while but tried it and I do like it. The one thing I don't like about it is that the algorithm and making it addictive to watch for hours. Would recommend having an occasional message suggesting to take a break once in a while like what the Nintendo Wii did instead of the breaks of relaxing for a bit before scrolling.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Meh, it's an interesting idea. But after browsing clips for awhile, I start to get annoyed at how short things are. And eventually I just goto YouTube so I can watch longer videos. More importantly, good clips are very few and far between. Most of the content is awarked, poorly done, and uninteresting."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They had to take off most of the sounds because of a stupid deal they tried to make, now everything is bad and sounds out of place"

I will be deleting the app and not downloading again until either 1) tiktok allows for fullscreen, uninterrupted scrolling or 2) tiktok implements OLED safety features in their app (which can be as simple as moving the icons a couple of millimeters every minutes). No entertainment is worth permanent damage to my device."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app has it all, it should be rated #1 today, it is very informative as well as educational, and a great way for one to express themselves, I have had tik tok for just a few years now and will continue to participate as long as the platform continues."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"it's a fun app, but its very slow and lags a lot. it also freezes up more than any other social media app i use. the worst part is that videos you post are some time to taken down for no reason and with no explanation. for example, had a video of me simply painting a character removed without any reason. it's very frustrating, and I'd love for these things to be, but it is overall pretty fun and a good time killer"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app, needs a few tweaks.....allow videos to fill the screen when turning your phone sideways into landscape mode.....like You Tube, give creators the option to purchase music cheaply, solely to use on the app, instead of muting videos. Make popular music selections longer than 30 seconds or 1 minute, add more video editing options, like a selection of transition effects. This would save me having to use third party apps to make the video first before uploading."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I loved tiktok at first and was having fun making videos and drafts but recently my videos are glitching. For example, the sound/video is out of sync with when I am talking. The audio is faster than how it was during my filming process (it slows down when I am lip syncing for some reason). Because of this it looks like my lips are saying something different to the audio. I have looked up videos to fix it and have already reported the problem to tiktok and nothing has changed, pleaseeee helpp!!"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So many fake accounts. People stealing content. As for tiktok shop! Never had so many refunds for non sent items! Honestly, the amount of stolen content from legitimate people is endemic. Tiktok should do more to stop the thefts. Enforce copyright laws use AI to stop content being used on other accounts"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I was enjoying the app for a while. Until the Tiktok interfact burned itself into my screen. 👍
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is great! It deserves all 5 stars because the content and the design are super good. I'm giving three stars because I and a few of my friends are annoyed at not being able to turn off post notifications for who we follow. It's automatic from what I've seen and the ""turn off"" button doesn't appear to work. If we can have an option for this in the main settings to opt out of post notifications altogether, I'd update this review with 5 stars."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Exceptional experience on the platform. Very enjoyable all the times.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I am loving that we can have folders! But there's a little issue? Whenever I click on a video that can no longer be played to remove it - it takes me all the way to the top of my favorites again. This has become rather inconvenient due to the amount of videos that show up as unavailable due to being deleted by the original poster. It this a glitch that will be fixed or something set? As soon as I remove the video it shoots me up to the top even when I'm not done removing videos.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like TikTok a lot and it is very addictive - I've found a lot of pages I really like, thanks to the excellent algorithm. However, I do have a couple of suggestions: 1) It'd be nice if there were a setting that allowed you to have the video either be paused or muted when you first open the app , so it wouldn't just start playing out loud in public when you don't want it to. 2) It'd be great if you could make an auto-scroll feature so you could do other things while watching videos."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is very entertainment. some time there maybe some inappropriate content for certain ages. it is a learning experience for certain it's at times, trial and error if I m to be honest. having and option work best it's highlighted and it's what we want . send what's needed in every situationsituation. This will assist the user more efficiently and give them confidence in their future choices"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Bruv🤩✨to the app Creator's it's way too good just on another level but just little bit of an issue coz whenever i post a video it loses quality even after posting at high quality what would be the problem coz whenever am looking at great celebrities their videos have the best quality leaving me in a quiz?..
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I had to uninstall the app after I saw it was acquiring more data from my phone than Google. Just leaving the app ""closed"" isn't sufficient enough to stop them from recording my keystrokes on other apps. As long as I had this installed on my device, the developer had access to anything from my text messages to my internet searches. It states all of this in the terms of service, but just asking to take over my phone like that is disgusting."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Can you add a volume control bar maybe to the top right of the screen so we can adjust the volume of the video on screen instead of the volume buttons on the phone. All of the videos are constantly a different volume and I'm always turning the volume up and down. It would help out a ton! Overall, awesome app though! Great for passing the time."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I remember when I first started hearing about TikTok I was like I'll never get an account look at me now, loving it!! Just give us more video options like more free effects and more video time. Let us control how long we want the video still doing TikTok 👍give up more effects for creating videos"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's really cool and fun but I didn't give it the full 5 stars because there are a few issues. It seems to be the lower users that don't have a lot of followers and stuff has the issue of TikTok sometimes making the audio on their videos come out off-sync for some reason or sometimes every single video they have made will be off sync for a while then will be back to normal other times, which can be really annoying sometimes. TikTok also has the problem with not showing profiles sometimes. Etc."

I don't understand why the people I follow can't see their posts unless going to their accounts at the same time seeing the whole world posts..and the things am not interested in watching.they don't have a common scence for removing my comments while it's normal without any offensing to anyone.its becoming very slow during videos the same when I prowse it from PC.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,UPDATE The app wasn't working correctly so I had to reinstall it now all my drafts are gone... hard work down the drain!

Over 3 months later and I still cannot send messages...I have tried to contact them multiple times about the issue but I never get any response...I have spent a small fortune on gifts too.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Bad. Plays a video when you load in, even if following a link to a video. ie a video will be playing before loading the video you are going to see. The back button doesn't have uniform use. Hitting it to back out of the app loads another video unlike other apps that let you back out without losing your place. While other screens will back out to, you guessed it, play a video. More bad, clicking a shared link will take you to the wrong video 4 or 5 times before you can get to the shared video."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I finally caved and created an account, and the first thing I noticed was that it hounded me with notifications and prevented me from following anyone until I interacted with other users' content for a bit. At least I think that's what I had to do, since TikTok never said why I couldn't follow my friends for a week. Everything's worked pretty smoothly since the first week of those moderately annoying issues. I like the video editor and the interface's usability. I can see why it's popular."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App keeps freezing and crashing every time I open it. Sometimes it'll crash as soon as I open it without even loading first video. Other times it'll load FYP normally but will crash if I try to open comments or click on literally anything else. Been doin this for about a week, I've tried everything they suggest to fix it and nothing works. I've emailed tiktok about it and haven't gotten any response. Even uploaded a screen recording of what happens and sent them a link to video in the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Really disappointing. Each and every time it keeps on saying tiktok isn't responding
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app is rather useful and fun. There's a lot of filters and ways to make content that make being on tiktok enjoyable. The biggest issue is screen burn. I've always kept my brightness below 50% and somehow have tiktoks buttons burned into my screen. It would be cool to have a setting that has the text disappear or change the colour of the text.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Currently, I can not view the videos I posted days prior if I have my account settings on private. Which they have been for more than a year. This just started 4 days ago. Followed all information given to ""fix,"" but nothing works. If I change my settings to public, then I can view my own videos.. seems strange. And, not what I want.😒"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This IS the new news. While yes algorithms are biased in a sense and POC are unfairly censored on this platform and many others. More voices are heard each day than ever before. This world is somewhat made up of two main groups of people [with various sub groups in each] and that is - People who use tiktok, and people who don't."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Wow what a useful app but it mostly bring up those videos which are already subscribed by us or anyway we had liked to.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Awesome app. I have one problem tough, it doesnt let me make slideshow videos. I want that feature really bad. Change to 5 stars when fixed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I hate Tik-Tok for some reason it keeps interrupting my games right in the middle of a game and kicking me off the game and then by the time I get back the game is over. And once you add pops up it keeps repeating over and over and over and over so she has to do something about it I don't know why. Beware of continuous non-stop ads and witches that nobody knows what to do with glitches. No other add interrupt me in the middle of a game ever.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Generally speaking, its a fun to us app and there was no problems. But almost 2 months after using, the app showed there was no internet connection. I tried re opening, but still it was the same. Then i deleted and later reinstalled the app, which then it worked. But now about 2 months ago the same issue had happened and I tried reinstalling many times, but it still doesn't work to this day. Please do fix the problem if possible."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Uninstalled and reinstalled to clear some issues and lost access to my original account. Now I can only visit it. Not happy and, after hours of searching, found no fix."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok is charging for 2 gifts for 269. They charge me 8 times the same amounts one after another the same day. I had put a claim with Google and also will PayPal. I am very disappointed 😞 I never thought this would happen there. Att: Francisca Sanchez, Unpdatatyng my feedback .Now it is much better and I'm very satisfied.I just hope that this doesn't happen again. Because Tixtox is getting infected with fake accounts and hackers and Scamers. Thank you for making Tixtox a safe platform"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Randomly lags out and won't load videos. Lives are always laggy. Shop wont accept my purchase requests. People I block can still follow me and message me(I still get the notification, too)."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Apparently there's a conflict with copyright because Tok Tik can't afford license also the CCP has keylogging software and ip tools used on every account don't recommend because of the company not the user end
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is the only app Ive download on my phone that has ever slowed my system IU down to absolute zero. Im not sure what it is, because its not even that big and there is more than enough space on my phone. But as soon as I delete TikTok, my phone works at optimum speed again... like wth. I would love to use the app but I cant wait 30seconds inbetween each press for function. And let me not get started on the actual app. Waiting for it to load, editong videos becomes an absolute pain."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I love it. But the reason I'm giving 1 star is bcuz I miss the 2018-2020 tiktok. If yall bring it back it'll be the best. Also beware it's not as judgemental as insta but its judgemental
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like tik tok, but i have been having probloms with commenting and duets. Whenever i post a video, Make sure that my comments and my duets are on. But, when i post a video- they keep turning back off for some reason. It also wont let me use the green screen effect- it keeps saying "" this effect doesn't work with this device"". If you could, please fix my probloms."

I have so many drafts to be posted,and if I reinstall it,all my work will be gone! Update. Tried everything,couldn't open the app,had to reinstall it,lost all my drafts!!! Now was finishing video editing,when app crashed again! Fix it!"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I couldn't even open the app because it literally broke my phone. It took me 20 minutes to ""get control"" which means 20 minutes of lag, being unable to close and open tabs, and 20 minutes of restarting and reopening my phone. Finally I closed my phone's app launcher. When I managed to uninstall tiktok, the birds began to sing and the sun peeked out from behind a gray cloud."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,installed. didnt even open it once since last installing it and the phone is warning me of high battery usage from tiktok in the background. delete.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"its an addicting app, sure. its consuming, which is what you aim for, most likely. i like it personally, but i have a google pixel, which is android run, and the disadvantages it has compared to an iOS is insane. plus, i recently switched from samsung to this phone, and immediately i go to upload a slideshow video, but i dont have the option to ""switch to photo mode"" and its VERY frustrating as thats one of my only ways i LIKE to upload."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I hate that the features you have on your app for security and privacy don't actually work, You can put as many words as you want into keywords and you'll still get the messages."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok is a great app for community content and to make friends. I will say, ""Can't keep calm. it's a friends platform."" Love you, tiktok team."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"A stupid app, not stupid by the way but they try to control what to watch, i will delete it for the last time, the reason for that is i am trying to see the content of another reagan, but I can't, even if someone send to me a video from that reagen I can't watch it, even the stupid politicy of meta is better than this."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Editing has become a passion, can't respond to a favorited comment in my drafts anymore, if I'm making a transition video it won't play the sound if I have to restart the second portion of the video so I can't lip sync while recording, if I want an effect to last the entire video it cuts off the last second of the effect which makes my video look weird, tags aren't working properly. Very glitchy lately."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Promotiosns not delivering without any reason. Also, zero custommer support."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app can yeah u whatever u want it's also very interesting you can make money from it and everything totally recommend 100%
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After the update my favourites sounds won't show up when i try to add it to longer videos.. It only shows up on 10-20 seconds videos, not showing up on longer videos.."

I've already reported the problem and I haven't received an answer yet. Hope it all turns out ok"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's very addicting in an unhealthy way I catch myself spending 7 hours on the app in one sitting, my. Only problem with it that it makes me not social at all and makes me forget the reality I'm living in"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,We need dark mode on Android. It's is 2024 and no dark mode???? But it has been on iOS for YEARS!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've had TikTok for pretty long, but recently there was another update (which is normal). TikTok had updated the generated captions which is actually really great! But not for me, I don't like the captions on my screen blocking most of the video. I know how to take the captions off but even if I turn the setting off, the captions will still show up. This is VERY annoying. I hope they fix the problem soon :)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It was really good at first; nice videos, great content and creators. But then the app started glitching and I don't live in America (hence the decrease in stars) and I can't watch any videos.I checked for strong wifi, switched off all other apps and restarted my device various times but nothing worked. My last resort is to delete and re- install the app. If it doesn't work than that means a low rating and am deleting it permanently. SO PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE FIX IT ASAP!! Thanks in advance."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Up until summer the app worked fine, now I can no longer use other people sounds, the app slows the audio down when I film so the words never match my mouth, filters are gone completely. Many bugs. I can only make original audio and even then the audio never matches what I'm saying. Very frustrating for us Android users. I bought a new phone with the best camera to film and can't even use it now."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm no longer able to create my own sounds when I upload videos from my camera roll. It was never a problem before my last ""update"". Update: now I can't even trim the audio inside the camera window you have to trim the audio from the audio list and when you do that and it goes to the camera/ recording window, the buttons don't work. What is going on tiktok?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Good app but for some reason I can't use photo mode it keeps making it video idk what to do
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Even when closed drops my volume sporadically, noticed when I'm listening to music in the shower. Just reinstalled it because it doesn't let you use search, see your saved videos (to an extent), etc I try to come back and the algorithm showed me bummer video after bummer video I've never had interest in, then popped up a screen to follow back bot accounts that have followed me (I'm like sub-200 views on all videos, mostly bots following) Garbo even as a time-waster."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have had tiktok for a while now. Almost 3 years now. Recently I can't crop a sound at all. Theres no option for that. It's really frustrating because I post on tiktok and sometimes the part of the audio I need is 20 seconds into it. I'm considering deleting this app because I have gone through two or three updates now thinking they would fix it and it hasnt been fixed.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Very nice and good app but some issues are here. This is not be updated. Other in this ap the video filter are not nice
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Why does tiktok mute our videos? How are we suppose to create content now if sounds are muted ?? Tiktok please 🙏,??????"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok is a very good app just scroll away with different content including funny,cringe,social,goofy,animals,etc. tiktok is the perfect app for you to seek new content and meet new people with a whole bunch of followers"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tried it once. (Only once, because I'm not allowed to social media much, for about 3 hrs) I didn't like the app, and so, I removed it. I hate all the stupid ads about this app. I see it everywhere- like a mosquito or fly that won't ever leave you alone. Like, I try to play one of my favorite games, and whenever I watch ads, this one always shows up. I keep seeing the same one too, over and over and over. Also the fact they SPAMMED my email after I deleted the app to the point I had to block."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Just lost my whole account for some reason. No explanation. Its okay though, the Tik tok experience has gotten pretty terrible so I was trying to cut down my usage. Filters don't work, videos freeze, and the sounds have gotten lousy. If your looking for fandom stuff, its best to find a new platform. I'm going to delete the app and move my art and future products elsewhere. I just lost the tik tok coin flip."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If i could give this app no star's, I definitely would. I've tried reporting fake accounts, nothing happens, tried commenting and tiktok stops them, security is a joke and they are just a bunch of cowards, there isn't even a way to talk to them, so I've had to come here to make myself heard. Bet this comment won't be here long either. Hope you guys can identify with my experience? Also to many adds and even though I say not interested, I still end up seeing it again and again."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I actually liked the app for awhile but Im tired of selecting the option to not show me a creator or music and the request being ignored.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app is horrible it doesn't let me send any tiktoks to my lover. This is absolutely horrible one moment his messages are there and then the next I can't even send him anything. I don't get why this hasn't been fixed. It's like I try to send him something and his icon isn't there.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Only complaint over time this app goes from 100 mb to 2 GB!! Lite version sucks on my phone. I don't post anything just watch. So if liking and bookmarking are the reason why it increases in size just let me know & I'll quit both.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is so dumb, it installed itself while watching YouTube and it wouldn't let me cancel the download!!! How low is that?!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I voted this a 3 star because every time I try to make a tiktok with photos, it only lets me pick 100, and I want it to have my whole camera role. OH, AND ANOTHER THING IT TOOK ALL MY REPOST AWAY FIX THAT TIKTOK!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is very good,but the problem is that when you are posting a picture or video then you exist from this app you have to start everything afresh"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very NEW to the app, so this is my reviewas a beginner (i can give an updated review after using the app for awhile). Very entertaining, I can get stuck on tiktok for HOURS. I don't like how it doesn't tell who sent u a message when u get a notification when someone sends u a message. Like u literally have to click the notification & go into the app to be able to see who the message is from, not a super big deal, just a little frustrating."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have used tiktok for 7 years now. It truly is a great app and brought me through lock down.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"TikTok is a great way to express your emotions to other people around the world, and the privacy settings are fantastic! You don't want people to talk to you, they won't. But I would appreciate it if you could make it a little easier to find the songs your looking for, like maybe when you search for a song, it comes up with the most popular suggestions, but to conclude, I love your app! -Elizabeth x"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app used to be great. However, I find it disheartening that they don't have an option to remove their tiktok shop tab, but make it easy to remove the Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics tab. When they first introduced ads on the platform, they occurred infrequently. They are occurring every 2-3 videos and sometimes multiples in a row. It's unfortunate that they are going this direction with a platform so many people enjoy."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Tiktok sucks now. It's almost all ads and recycled videos I've seen before.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It is a good app one that my I don't like is that I got copyright on one of my videos when I used my own sound it was my voice
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is so fun and awesome cause like when I like someone's post it was awesome I even made a lot of new friends on tiktok as well
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pretty straight forward. Would like more editing options. Also would like to have the choice to show the TikTok watermark or not. I have had people I know tell me that I don't show up in their feeds though, and they have to search to find my posts. That's a bummer. Sharing to other social media network is meh. I've found it's just easier to download the finished product and share it manually."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Recently liked videos don't show on My Likes page, and somehow, nobody got a clue on how to fix it. I also hate that there isn't a select all option to delete old videos."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I would give 5 stars to this great app if it made all the effects available to everyone on tiktok.. Some video effects are only compatible for iPhones. That's not fair to your Android users. I have an LG phone and i can't even make the video i want because the ""green screen"" effect isn't compatible with my device. Disappointing.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am tired of seeing ads for this app. I could literally go onto a different app for a split second and the only thing I see is an ad for THIS APP. Not only am I swarmed by ads, but I am tired of it constantly producing cringe content. Even though I have barely used it (only 3 days and no more than that), I'm also tired of the stupid trends, challenges, and other things that are generated from this app. Plus, the moderation is quite low quality."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, this app is always buggy. It doesn't even show options for certain things like uploading in high quality on some of my devices but does on others. It has a feature one day and disappears the next. They really need to get some quality control. I try contacting the help desk and they just tell me there isn't an issue or that they just never get back to me."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I never posted a video and made a tiktok for a short time and deleted it after. I recently recreated a new tiktok and the email I used was suspended. And when I tried using a new email it would force my account into child mode. With zero way to change it. I have no idea why I've been banned considering I never TRULY used tiktok. Never posted a video. Never even used it for entertainment. I just had the app existing. And yet I have been banned from using it now. I even sent emails to them. Nothin
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been using tik tok since late 2018, and it's been great. But the loading issues are horrible. I have had 4 phones since 2018 and my last one and this one have experienced comment loading issues, liking the video issues I can have full bars and it could say the server is out so I'd have to like it again the comments just take so long to load I have to scroll back up and down and sometimes that works. It's not a bad app I've been on it awhile, but the server problems are really annoying."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There is more behind this app than you can imagine, I'll just say the Chinese are involved and the true intentions are not looking bright at all, feel free to use this app but remember what data it takes, like your apps, search history, cell phone, contacts, location, camera, microphone and so on. Whatever is truly behind tik tok, it's not looking good, not at all, stay safe out there"

No other apps ever do this, but it happens with this ALL the time. Maybe it's spyware?? Not sure why else it needs to turn itself on all the time and drain my battery. Either way I'm out!

I would love this option (it's installed on my other platforms), but it seems to only be available on apple products (I'm an Android user).

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app, transition is smooth throughout as well as being able to learn and understand how to navigate through it. The section that recommends videos based on the users history has not disappointed myself with something that isn't my taste or forte to indulge in. Overall the apps functionality and operations compliment each other so well that you are able to enjoy your time watching videos without stress or wait times."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Way to much censorship that's unevenly applied. It does not adjust the display for different devices, leading to the edges getting cut off. When i tried to suggest a feature (add a other option to the big report page) they was no where to actually put in a suggestion in the ""suggestions"" feature. Good communities, lots of good content. The app its self is garbage. Disabled notifications and i still get them."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Overall the idea of the app is great and i do enjoy watching some videos and creators on here. But when i see young children on the app i feel as that is not normal and not only that but the harasment and bullying that goes on. It is really sickening, although i do not blame the ""app its self"" for being a bad place but i do blame the people on it, moniter your app better i guess 😅🤷"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Fantastic app. This is by far the most awesome app on the Internet. Shows videos you cannot find anywhere else. Even hidden videos you will never see any place else!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Editing could be a little easier to use, eg. More than one song on longer videos, overlay with transparency options."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I don't know if this is a problem anyone else is experiencing, but for some reason the visuals and the audio are way out of sync. Like, the audio will have ended only 1 second into the video because it starts before the video. It clearly isn't the fault of the user that posted the video because it is consistant through various users and gets worse the longer I use the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Had this for about a month, It worked perfectly but lately has been bugging hardcore... I shuffle the clips I want the way I want, click next, then the original background sound of the clips are mixed in with the music, then i click voice over and exit out the original sound is muted but the clips either glitch, freeze, or even dont play and look like a picture even thou its a video... would give 5 stars if this issue was resolved, I dont understand how it was perfect a few weeks ago and now💩."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Tiktok has been a great experience and I know more about what trending and what happening and what people eat and a lot of interesting stuff.... People complain about it.... Maybe their phone cannot handle tiktok or maybe their storage is poor by for me everything is OK and I've learned and enjoyed so yeah❤️👍...
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"it's been good but now it's been glitching. the videos are buffering more than ever. you apparently can't pause on the slideshows anymore?? and before when you could pause on them you had to swipe up to get to the comments and then pause it instead of simply tapping the screen. whenever I press the back button, even when I'm on an account's page, the app somehow resets my fyp. I leave the app for one second and my fyp resets even though I used to be able to leave and come back to the same video."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I want the how was your year from 2020 back. Other than that it's just cringey trends and now the remove literally 90% of the sounds
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After recent update, I'm no longer able to upload photos or videos. Keeps sending me to change settings when TT has access already."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app one of the best apps I ever used amazing u can talk with friends meet new people it's really a awesome app to use
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"NEEDS SEARCH BAR FOR LOOKING FOR SPECIFIC VIDEOS ON YOUR PAGE! private or public. it's hard to find stuff through private videos because I have so many, I'm hoping to see something like it come to the ideal. now I'm sure something like that will happen. personally, I think it's best for all of us using this app. it'd be super duper helpful if it wouldn't crash either while I'm scrolling through videos... EXACTLY WHY we need it, and honestly just easier."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"the only good thing on this app is the people, and even then, the algorithm gets you stuck on one type of video and you can never explore for more. No dark mode option on android, forcing dark mode doesn't work, annoying useless system notifications and tiktok now! notifications you can't turn off. if it wasn't good for connecting me with friends I'd delete it. very unfriendly to the user and settings are amazingly limited for how much money they make."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Everytime I pause a video it automatically starts playing again after a few minutes, it's annoying. I pause for a reason, why have the feature if It'll just automatically un pause by itself. I tried reporting the issue on the app itself but all it gave me was ""network error"" when I hit submit, even though my network is perfectly fine and working, guess that's another bug. Overall TikTok keeps doing things by itself, not just un pausing videos."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There is good and bad, like too many unwanted commercials/ads, and the biggest thing is hard-core fast battery drain. The positive thing is that you can find great recipes! Suggestions would be to add an advanced search filter feature to find local friends with, like maybe, an option to choose (filter by) Christian or even a sub-filter by denomination. (Example: Non-denominational Christian) or sort by Christian bowling group or soccer."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Currently can't even open TikTok due to this bug that states I've been banned and won't let me sign and keeps me in a loop. I've already reported the issue when I logged in to my account on my computer and still have this issue with my phone.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,When ordering something on the tick tock shop on the 11th of December it keeps getting pushed off I still have no delivery date and now when trying to ask for a refund instead of giving me my whole $30 back they only want to give me $12 back and keep all the shipping fee. Which is BS
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Everytime I go live, it freezes after about 2 minutes. It does this evey single time I go live. I've tried restarting the app and my phone but it still keeps freezing. I can't even do my live because it freezes everytime. It's very annoying to me and my followers. It has to be the app because I don't have a problem with anything else on my phone."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Ok, so when i first got this app, it was Amazing! Indeed alot of funny/Talented Videos! But, there's just 1 tiny bug that I wasn't able to get rid of for months.. So, when i clicked on a video, i wanted to press the little heart (Like button) but then i saw a error come up my screen saying that I wasn't able to like the video, i tried again, but still, the error remained. Please fix it, i really like this app"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love tik Tok it is just the best way to get on the world connected I just don't know how we ever live life without Facebook messenger and tik Tok I just don't understand what we was all doing how we stayed connected how we got anything done how did we ever get anything done with the garage door on regular telephone and I'm still don't even understand
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,As much as I use this app it genuinely sucks. It has a bug like every other week. right now I can't even like videos because as soon as I like a video it just deletes it. Tik tok even started deleting big chunks of videos I liked. So fix your app tik tok
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The update I have has made it to where any time I go to look at anything in my messages it acts like it's loading it twice or something but it's very inconvenient.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Brilliant! Aswell as being excellent for simple entertainment, it is also extremely informative, it shows every side of the story from all cultures it brings people together, and shares ideas the community on this app can truly move mountains!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Every 3rd video is an ad. Plus lots of sponsored pushy content. Deleted for now
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I actually really enjoyed this app. Unfortunately I had to delete it because it somehow doesn't have a screen timeout which multiple times has resulted in me waking up to my phone either dead or absolutely BURNING up because the video had been playing all night while plugged in. I can't believe not even a 5, 10, 15 minute timeout???? You're killing my phone guys"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"tiktok is good and all but when I re-downloaded the app, it won't let me log in and it keeps saying stuff like ""no network connection"" but I'm right next to my internet box or whatever. idk why I'm sure I've seen someone say it's the same to them. And till now, I am not able to log in and if I do, it keeps saying my internet is not working or just an unstable network connection. it works perfectly fine knowing I went on Instagram and YouTube."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,App keeps shutting down as soon as I open it.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Ever since the last update, I can't comment or like any TikTok that anyone sends to me. If I try, a message pops up telling me that I'm ""leaving the app."" If I choose ""continue,"" it takes me to the app store for another update. I've clicked on ""update"" twice now, thinking maybe the second one fixed the problem, but it hasn't changed anything. If I try to do anything else, it takes me to a different video than the one someone shared with me."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I can't upload photos in tiktok it's auto convert to a video.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app should delete the cached data after you close it, or at least give you the option to do it (it uses a ton of space and it's obnoxious to go find the storage settings everytime you run up from space). Also, when I comment, it doesn't register it corrextly and nobody can see my comments. Sometimes when I'm scrolling it gives likes and follows, but being reallistic, that could be my mistake, eventhough I really try to avoid it. But It's a great platform to share and laugh."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why is there so much automatic noise?? I dont want it screaming a dumb video at me as soon as I open the app. Id rather it open in my profile, in SILENCE. I dont want a terrible loud song playing as soon as I go to edit my video If don't pick the song, I dont want it playing. There is too much chaos. It freezes everytime I edit. Spent two hours trying to edit one 20sec video, kept freezing & exiting out. It doesn't save editing progress so I had to start over everytime. I gave up. Uninstall."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's okay, but l can't message someone who l follow,yet when he doesn't follow me,atleast their should be a message request,like Facebook, that's why l have rated you with 4 stars only"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used to love this app but recently I can't even open it. When I click on the app it only shows the logo and my phone completely crashes, I have to restart it every time. I tried updating the app but it says the update is impossible.. I don't want to uninstall it and lose my drafts but not being able to open the app and it making crashing my phone is so annoying."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,A very good app to enjoy. If you are sad you can use tiktok because it will make you feel better.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Tiktok has a bot ran support system to doesn't support. There is no way to contact them. They will punish if you report glitches. Reporting violations will get you in trouble. You can lose your account whether it's a violation or not unless you pay. This app isn't free. Their contact information is wrong.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is great! I have had it since 2020 and I really enjoy it, as most people I know do. This app is fun to use and make videos on, and even make new friends. The only drawback is that it can get kind of addictive, but other then that it's a good trendy app to have."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"OKAY, I GOT THE SLIDESHOW AND STORY FEATURES. NOW PLEASE, I PLEAD AGAIN AND AGAIN. GIVE ME THE REPOST BUTTON/FEATURE, PLEASE. AND SINCERELY THANKS"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"When editing a video it freezes up turns white and then closes the app I spent 2 days trying to get on video ready for posting and everytime I made the content and start adding words it would freeze up, and I couldn't save it to drafts.. another I have ready to post and tiktok won't post it. I've spent this whole week not posting.. because of the app. Other then that the ap is great. I love the variety of options and editing features."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app but there's one HUGE issue, the reaction time of the pause button. It seriously takes 3 seconds for the damn thing to react, which doesn't sound like a lot but when you're trying to see something specific, it's huge. This is almost a deal breaker for me, it makes it impossible to enjoy the content without getting extremely frustrated to the point it makes me want to delete the app all together."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,There is some kind of super awful sliding/ transitioning going on every time the screen changes and I don't know what it is but I hate it
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,So many problems in account I have no community guidelines and something else but I can't upload my videos
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great app. Too many ads. If you saw a video and lose it... It's lost forever unfortunately like so many other apps. Starting not to see much diverse videos like when I first joined the app. That was the one thing that was enjoyable compared to other platforms. Another Con: when going back to look at saved videos that you may not have had time to see originally has a lot of deleted content. That I do not like
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"After spending so many years on tiktok, I got to know that tiktok isn't a reliable platform because anytime they can mute your videos without any special issue mostly. Secondly, if you delete your some of videos, they do not have restoration option to get back these videos. Luckily, I was able to get back some of my videos by personal effort but disheartened by tiktok. Their feedback team isn't cooperative at all. No one should create video in that third class platform at all. Thanks!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been using tiktok for years. Today I noticed I was seeing a ton of ads so I decided to count how many videos I could scroll through before I hit a sponsored post. Four. Four to five. I did this over and over, you get 4-5 real videos and then an ad. Like clockwork. This is just an ad platform at this point. Pretty soon it's going to be only targeted ads and no actual content. At least this finally got me to delete. I'm gonna save so much time now"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love it but for some reason the filters aren't working for me nor the translation.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy this app but recently it has been playing up hugely. I have tried to make the same video about eight times. It keeps saying when I find it in drafts that it has been ""deleted by a third party app"". And now, when I try to save it to drafts, it takes me back to the shooting page and deletes everything I have done."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm not sure if I'm alone in this, if it's me specifically for some reason, but I've switched phones so its not the phone. But videos WILL NOT play when I'm connected to WiFi. I can read the comments, scroll and see the video descriptions, go to peoples profiles, etc. EVERYTHING works, except the videos will not play. Its just like, a blurry orange-ish screen. Like someone's finger is over the camera. So yeah..... this app would be 5 stars cuz I LOVE IT, but...I miss it. 🥺 please fix it guys 😭"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"When I'm trying to make a video if I redo it to many times with I found to be like 4 takes the screen will start flashing or just completely go black wich can be very annoying. Also when I am scrolling and likening other vids it will sometimes stop and say I am ""going to fast"" and then I'm not able to like for another 6 or 7 houers.(I don't know how long it is for other people but thus happens a lot.) But other than that u live the app and have made lists of good friends."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"You can get strikes for saying Ew at harmless things. Like not even hate speech. I'm just stating that I find it disgusting with two letters. Sometimes, I wish the app would have been banned back when that mattered. It sucks now. However, I know my opinion doesn't matter to the people who own it, so if someone working with tiktok does see this, please, dear god, fix your app to be as enjoyable as it was back in 2020. :/"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is amazing . For example when you have press The button to record a video with a sound.on the camera app this has never happened . This has been glitch has been occurring for about 6 month and a half . Some time at work but not often . I headed ever recorde vedio anyway but I do however post edited . So it doesn't really bro my vedio viral and support everyone else ❤️
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The creators are great, but the app itself needs a serious update. Central record button keeps disappearing, versions keep changing but never to the latest, and now it's reset itself back to the original Tik-tok, no background noise remover. Haven't even been updated to the version with the Studio. Really, really bad functionality."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm trying to organize the massive amount of favorited videos I have into collections but when I updated thinking maybe the process had been streamlined better since my last update, it was even worse. I have to unfavorite, refavorite to specify which collection, and instead of being able to swipe to the next video it takes me back to the top of my favorites and I have to scroll all the way back to where I left off each time. I also wish there was a collection option for sounds."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I never get any of the new features updates are supposed to have, and contacting support just gets me nowhere. Apparently they're features intended for beta users, but I used to have some of these features. (Namely the progress bar) They just disappeared randomly. Lives are also glitchy and stutter constantly, though that may just be my internet. It's become very hard to navigate this app when I can't do half the things everyone else can do."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Well what can I say, the content on the platform is good and engaging and it is fun to scroll through. But why 1 Star then? Because their report system is totally useless, scammers go totally unpunished and harmful content stays up. It really is a shame."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've had a lot of big issues with age verification, being able to get a response for help and unnecessary flagging. The age issue has since been fixed. They have fixed it before and it's switched back to an under 16 account. Hopefully it sticks this time. Very frustrating! Other then that, the app is Great. Hopefully they can work out the bugs at some point."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible, fix this garbage already for android 14. Videos are CONSTANTLY BUFFERING FOR NO REASON but sound is playing without issues. And also what the hell is wrong with the new animations are they intentional or do they look this bad on purpose?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's a great way to spend our free time and make status videos on just one click

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App crashes all the time. It has crashed in the middle of editing and I've lost whole videos. When I'm scrolling the videos will go all white or all black and I have to get out of the app and start it up again. When recording it does this ""hicup"" thing and my video jumps and if I keep recording my mouth doesn't line up with my words so I have to keep pausing and re-recording. So many issues!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok has been glitching and not showing the right information this whole entire week. Every single audio I use will say that it's not available, and if I click on my video it says it couldn't be played. This is very frustrating because I'm trying to keep my account as active as possible but with this issue it's really annoying. Views won't show for anyone including me, please fix this asap."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely horrendous. This app has literally the whole globe on it and it also has amazing features. THAT DON'T EVEN WORK! honestly shooting a duet 30 times before it decided that it doesn't want to: Offset the sound Keep crashing Doesn't post, just deletes everything Messes with the volume Absolutely annihilates the quality Completely deletes the audio from the OG video or just the end And many more amazing things to deal with. Its been like this for months. So, 1/5. Absolute headache."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Hobestly so annoyed because tiktok changed its, search engine so now when i search things, maybe 5 videos that are relevant will pop up and the rest will be completly unrelated. Im trying to look at tomatoe soup recipes, not socer game edits. I dont even like soccer. Idk ill change my reciew if this issue gets fixed but right now its annoying"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This app is amazing .however I did have come glitches happen while using the app. For example when you press the button to record a video with a sound the sound played while the camera is just stock in a position and no. On the camera app this has never happened. This glitch has been occurring for about 1 month and a half. Sometimes it works but not often. I herded ever record video anyway but i do however post edited. And it works just fine. So it doesn't really brother me that......... I
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It is so good and I spend all of my time on it but there's some videos that they are so bad even for kids because a lot of kids watch tik tok and we all know that (sry for my english cause I am Egyptian)
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's horrible and f's up your phone. It constantly pops up even when you don't open it. Pop's up in front of apps you are using, and when you go on your surch engine, it pops up before you can even surch for anything. You constantly have to close it each and every time you do something. I even uninstaled it, and it keeps doing it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Im not sure if I was not stoned at moment of trying to start with this app, but I can assure you. This app have most weird and stupid UI in history. Damn buttons and text cover almost whole screen, and if you try to hide UI by taping on empty space, what is actually meant to work, is unexpectedly pauses the video. Deleted the app to prevent my brain cells to die, cuz they know something about good UI"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"And so I've heard from smart resources that tik tok steals important information from emails, texts, messages, etc. Anything that you put out there in the web, to later sell it or use it for different purposes. Only when downloaded to your phone, though. That's why I use it from the outside. However, they make it really hard for you to open certain pages, almost forcing you to get tired and give up so you can finally download the app to your phone."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Entertainment is very good And motivation is also very good in TikTok
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Its a very fun and addictive with a lot of interesting content uploaded by different people. The suggestions are tailored to your preferences pretty nicely. If you want to upload your own content, it is also possible. It would help if there is simple option provided by tiktok to add your own recordings easily. At the moment it is too complicated. But 5 stars anyway. Totally recommended."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's not as invasive, toxic and don't hook you up like Instagram, I've always avoided using ir because I'm a DoomScroller, but I've started using it and I've loved it,the community is amazing, the content moderation is good at not c3nsoring different views of the world politics like in Igrm that censor everything that is not pro-USA or USA aligned."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,When i update your app it keep snoozing and refuse to open
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's a cool app for Knowledge but sometimes it can be worst but In my opinion it's a good app
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have encountered a rare glitch that no one seems to have been able to consistently solve. The app is connected to the internet, but my profile, nor any videos show. I have done all the troubleshooting steps and have contacted support many times to no avail. When the app works, it was a fun experience, but the support team has refused to assist with this issue, and there are no fixes to be found. [App and phone software up to date; Samsung Galaxy S21]"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Spent a questionable amount of time on the app. Impressive features and content. The short form videos will take emotional toll as you will eventually become ""numb"" and only watch content out of habit. It feels repetitive and unproductive, I believe the infinite scroll makes the personalization of videos poor. Scrolling through 400 videos a day and liking out of habit really ruins the experience. Just limit your time on the app if you have this problem too. This is a design flaw."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I was not having problems since I started using this app. ButI'm now facing a problem of my views and Luke's not showing on the latest video I uploaded. I know that people are viewing and liking it, but it's showing zero views and zero likes on both accounts which I don't understand"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's very nice and yeah but I don't like it a bit bc of the band acc like if I make one they banned it yeah so I rate it 5stars yeah still it's great u can make any content watch ur fav YouTuber on it like Joyceful tingles
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a super fun app. The one gripe I have is sometimes my fyp will refresh when I don't necessarily want it to and when I hit back, the video I'd been watching just disappears into thin air and no matter how many times I hit back, I can't find the video. It's made it to where I❤️ every video before I even see it, then unheart it if I don't like it because I've missed what looked like so many awesome videos never to seen or heard from again. I do love tictok despite that one tiny flaw though😘"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like how there's a contrast between little silly videos to help your creativity, and more serious videos, that actually make u think. It's not just a mindless app for people who don't want to think about the real world. There are videos to help, with problems of the real world. Yes, there are a lot of really fake and stupid things on tiktok, but there are also a lot of things that are smart and informational. Overall, I think tiktok is a really fun and creative app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's good it's just for some reason i can't get dark mode pls fix this I'm tired of getting blinded every time
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Account suspended with no reason given. Seems to be a common problem when searched on google. Uninstalled
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Fun way to meet new people. The major thing I don't like is when you find a video you like and want to repost from you page and TicTok either takes the video down or they mute the sound track. It doesn't make sense how the video goes against the rules on my page as a REPOST but it's fine to be on the original page!!!! Just does not make sense!!! I had multiple videos treated this way. I might agree with them if it was an original post I made and did something wrong by a REPOST it's not right.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is a great app, you can follow people, like them and comment on them. One major problem needs fixing though, I can't access the part where you can add/gain more followers, yet some people have done that already. Another good feature that should be on there is you can follow, block or keep an eye on people without them knowing, but only if it is very important."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"i think what would make it better is to have access to make videos for more than 15 seconds. I liked it before but then it updated so it's too short. The other thing is that whenever i put effects on specific places and timing, it always seemed to not work out. sometimes the effects come too late or too early from where i place it after i saved or downloaded it. I find it quite annoying."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It's update system is not working well it is not installing TikTok please please please fix it and it' not working well hang ho Raha hy
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I don't know why or how but when I record my short videos and save them as drafts. The video itself opens for a couple seconds then closes it's almost as the video deleted by itself on the app. Can you tell me why this is happening how to fix it and if I could get the video back? Technically it's not gone like the video is there but it's pitch Black.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good day, guys! Thanks for this great app, but something always happens with my account. I cannot see any video, cannot search, cannot see my posts. Nothing. Reinstallation, reboot, log in/out and so on don't help. The stated reasons are ""not the network connection"" or ""you use our app too frequently""... What?? At the same time, my second account works well. Have a nice day!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The videos/clips on TikTok are good, but the app wastes my phones battery and sends CONSTANT emails and makes it so I can't find anything in my inbox, and it started aggressively advertising to me when I deleted and then de-activated my account. The people or things shown on the platform aren't horrible I just have a issue with the ads and how it wastes my battery and aggressive advertising. It also sends constant notifications that I don't like much either"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great platform to view videos to pass the time. My only complaints are that it's difficult to process a payment for coins. I've been trying to purchase coins for a while, and it keeps trying to process the payment with another email linked to the phone. I can't find a way to switch it to the email tethered to the actual Tiktok account."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Downgraded from a 5 star. This app is just littered with fake accounts trying to follow. I had to move to private just to keep them from following. And people randomly filing complaints over stupid stuff puts you in warning status then a ban. Was a fun platform in the beginning but went downhill. Deleted account.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the app ut keeps me busy. But when I was trying to send a message to my friend, the message failed. So I kept Uninstalling and reinstalling. And it still said my messages were failing. Sometimes the app just bugs me. And it glitches, saying that I have no direct messages or only this amount of people I have direct messages with. Please fix this tiktok. But other wise I love the app. Sometimes I just have to close the app. And it works."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ever since I updated my TikTok I haven't been able to open it at all. It kicks me of the moment I click on the app. I've had this app since 2020 and never had a problem until now. Please fix it, many people are complaining."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"VIRUS ALERT!!!! This app remains open in your background and uses up data while doing so. It took up 7GB OF DATA in one month. Luckily i have unlimited. Also, videos aren't loading, what so ever, doesnt matter if I'm on Wifi or my data. Also since installing the app a month ago I have had constant pop up ads while in other apps. I look at my apps running and Tik Tok is there, running in the back ground no matter how many times I force stop. Leaves my phone rather unsecure. Time to delete."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Randomly turns on my profile views automatically without my permission... not good for stalking purposes. I never even have to touch anything it just does it for me, habitually an inconvenience. 0/5 stars!"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The app keeps crashing and freezing sometimes you can't even post a video when you want.#trash
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The tik tok app doesn't respond and it doesn't connect it black out when you go live
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, the best social media app in my opinion. While there is one thing that annoys me about it, it's still 5-star worthy. The issue I'm referring to is that sometimes when I follow someone or favorite a video, it won't work. The button will act like it did. Like, after I press follow, the button turns to unfollow, and so on. But when I look at my following list, the account (s) isn't listed, and when I look at my favorites list, the videos don't appear at all. They stay in my liked list tho"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Everything's really good but prevent's from sending direct message without any reason!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Commenting is a mess. The guidelines are so unclear and comments get removed without a reasonable explanation. Also if you try and delete one letter in a word you mispelled, the whole word gets deleted instead. I should also mention comments are a very limited amount if characters so you almost just need a video just to respond to anything. If you try and split your comment into parts, tiktok will scramble them in an order that makes no sense. Good product, messy app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is the best social media app of all time. It's the best because you can watch different kind of videos and you can also upload your video's
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Love this app!!! But the one thing that is really sad and makes me feel frustrated/mad is that if you delete tiktok and re-install it all the drafts get deleted no matter how many you had and you can't get them back. Please do something about it like a new update or something where you can get your drafts back even after deleting the app.The drafts are sooo important to many and it's really upsetting when you lose them with the thought of not being able to get them back. Please and thank you ❤️
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,When I add someone I cant chat with them! I dont see any direct messages on privacy that's very boring to not chatting with ppl😒
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After adding ""collections"" to favorites i was excited to finally be able to sort through all my favs, but there's no way to sort the favorites by oldest to newest; if they could add a button for the option to sort favorites by dates/dates added or something, that would be super user-friendly and fantastic. Otherwise it's really hard and inconvenient to try to sort anything out. Also the ""not interested"" button DOES NOT WORK. I REPEAT, IT DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Changing to 1☆ until it's FIXED."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's was so sweet and so fun to have new friends and sees alots of faces
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Due to the new update I can't use the back button anymore. The entire screen spins. I don't know how else to describe it, but it makes the app unuseable."

She said its on already but I still can't save!! Like actually I kinda need you to fix it Edit: Also a new problem is that when I watch the videos, it delays in the beginning so when I watch the video the sound is normal but the video is delayed and 3 seconds later it goes really fast"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's good but very slow and I can barely watch 2 videos without it freezing when I have good wifi
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Was usable when I was able to get the algorithm to find videos related to my interests. But since the last few updates the not interested feature doesn't seem to deprioritize videos from creators I'm not interested in and I still get similar things anyway. there has been an increasing number of ads and on top this the app requires a user agreement that is incredibly invasive on your phone. Decided to just uninstall.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It used to be class but personally it is only going downhill with updates no one needed like deleting all drafts whe you uninstall the app
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's not opening in my phone i click on app on my phone but it's not opening and automatically back or screen become white

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I found the app as an extremely fun tool to search up certain things although recently the app has stopped working for me and continues to tell me that my account has been banned because of too many warnings despite the account never getting a single warning in the first place. The problem happened to me a couple of months back it did eventually fix itself, but I don't know when it'll fix itself again. If anyone can help with this problem, let me know"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I work so hard on some tiktoks that take time to make them, but every once in a while my drafts get messed up or deleted! Makes me so mad! I hate putting time and effort in some that just end up gone! I had count downs for vacations I couldn't finish because the drafts get messed up, can't record from the spot yoy left off at, or it is just gone."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app, nothing to say, but the problem i have is that I have two accounts and on one of them I can't repost or do any recent features while the other is completely fine."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Captions don't show up anymore for any of the videos I watch. Even ones where the creator says they made captions and other people in the comments can see them. I have captions turned on in the settings of the app. I'm able to hear fine but it's upsetting thinking of hearing impaired people experiencing this issue. That makes the app not so inclusive anymore and I would hope this is something high on the priority list to fix.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I like it but sometimes it hurts my eye and you might say it my problem. But when I watch TV it don't hurt my eye
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Since the latest update pressing two fingers on the screen no longer removes all of the captions etc, other people have mentioned 'clear mode' but that only seems an option for iPhone users. Can this be fixed? It was soo much easier to view the whole tiktok. Also alot of the time the video to audio goes out of sync during the tiktoks, getting worse as the tiktok goes on. I have also noticed it glitching at the begining of the tiktok and re starting after a couple of seconds."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've made some amazing friends and love creating videos and everything, but the community guidelines are ridiculous and you can get a violation for just about anything. They don't give you clear answers when you do get a violation and you're wondering what you did. Edit: I posted this like 2 years ago, nothing has really changed lol"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I like this app, and my friend and I constantly send each other videos. However, every single tik tok she sends me has the same cover on it. Its like my account is glitches and the little preview shows as one tiktok she sent me a week ago. I tried to log out, uninstall the app, AND delete our entire conversation, yet it still isn't fixed. Please fix this!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, it's very fun to use. But I've been having issues with the audio when I'm trying to record my videos. Even when I lipsync the words perfectly when filming, once the video comes out in preview, the beginning of the video is chopped off making the audio play way after the video. I've done everything to change this (clearing cache, deleting drafts, updating app, deleting and reinstaling app) but nothing has permanently changed the issue. I need help."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Love the concept, but the app is super buggy. I used to be able to scroll and watch at my own pace with no worries about being unable to watch a video that looked interesting. Now the app randomly freezes and shuts down then reboots and removes all previously watched videos. I didn't have the chance to watch several that looked promising. I am very annoyed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The best you can text your friends and watch tiktoks it's just the best and the edit people can make

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent app. Super easy to make videos with sounds and when I tried to tie a sound to my video, it automatically synced the video up to the audio to make it match. Marvelous app. I have used it for years before making my first tiktok. And after doing so and realizing how easy it is, I might be annoying for a good long while lmao. Thank you devs, the app is perfect."

They said they were unable to verify my age even though the never asked to verify. Even after sending age proof, they permanently banned it. Then tried to say that I was in violation of the Integrity and Authenticity guidelines. AGAIN, this was a blank account that they banned before it could even be used. They are impossible to reach and I'm quite certain it's automated messages. Tiktok sucks so bad. Don't bother tryin"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Every other video seems to be someone trying to sale some useless piece of junk.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The Tiktok is best place to interact with friends but the new guidelines are a bit harsh on others. Reason I update my rating is tiktok takes Soo much commition for gifts 70+ percent that's very high. Battery Issue Drains my battery very fast and the lite version is not available in ociana. What the hill is going on tiktok?
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"TikTok is an amazing app were you can be funny, talented, inspired, and many more things! I really like it, and mostly because I would've been still drawing people like little kid. Though the reason I put 4 stars was because it is all mostly in arabic. When I want to choose a song I can barely understand anything!! So please put an option were you can be able to choose more than one language. I am from America, so please hurry! Other than that, it is amazing."

I have bugs all the time, and no one has gotten back to me about fixing them. I want to make more content with tiktok but it can be really frustrating when I don't have access to certain features or features I've been using (lile text ro speech) don't work suddenly and even updating the app won't bring it back. I'm using a brand new z Flip and had hoped buying a new phone would fix these issues but it didn't."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This a nice app to have, if u know what type of information you will be needing.. it's got some news, entertainment, health information, definitely needs to be watching or supervisor, when children and adolescents are browsing."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This has to be my favorite app! I'd been wanting to create videos for a long time but its usually a long and complicated process on a phone or you would just need to have a computer ready with video editing programs installed. I'm glad tik tok has it set up to film and edit in the app really easily. It saves me a lot of time so I can create, film, and share my projects within the same day."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Love the app, but the notifications are a MESS! 1. Live streams notifications is off in settings but I still get them. In the android settings it's categorized under ""other"",but turning it off also turns off the direct messages notifications. 2. Separate notifications in the shade for every single message, instead of one notification saying ""x new messages"". 3. Notifications don't go away even after they're veiwed unless manually dismissed. 4. No feature to reply to a specific DM in chat"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,TicTok is super cool i like it very much you can do everything on it and it has edit features on pictures and sounds and everything.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Don't get me wrong I love tiktok nothing is wrong with it so far (for me at least) BUT I don't like how it can only go up to 10 minutes. Like why can't we just record as long as we want. I'M SO TIERD OF HEARING ""come back for part 2"" ""sorry I can't finish go to part 2"". Or videos just randomly cutting off. Tiktok you just gotta fix it for us please!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,My screen spins ever time I click a notification or a comment video??? I'd add it on if I could it's actually ridiculous how I can't even enjoy this app properly anymore.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why does this app automatically keep the beauty filter on when I manually turned it off? Even when it SAYS it's off, I can clearly tell there's a filter on when I cover and uncover my face. My skin tone and face shape glitch out, and I know it isn't my phone doing it because I've checked multiple times. Why are the app developers doing this to people? This is extremely damaging to users' self image. When users want it to turn it off, KEEP IT OFF. It shouldn't be that difficult."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Horrible, I can't even add friends, or go on my previous account."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There are multiple things wrong with this app.. For starters push notifications are very bad. Second, video format is very bad. Whenever I post a video it is posted with 2 black bars on the sides of the video. Third, the app is nowhere near the same as the ios version. There are so many small and big features that are on ios that aren't on Android."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It is really good but when I posted a video that took me 2 hours it said it was community guide lines even though it was just a girl flying so yeah

Everytime I scroll through I keep getting people with a crying filter playing Minecraft saying they'll go to sleep when they win. I've already blocked seven accounts doing this and put, ""Not Interested"" to make sure I stopped seeing them. Then I got Live videos of a big shirtless guy being weird, the vegan teacher, and MORE people crying saying they're tired. I would just like an option to turn off Live Views please."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like the concept and the mostly the execution of the apps feature. However I find the messages system most frustrating. There is no way to reply to a particular video if several were sent. Neither can I see who I got a message from or what the text is in the notification. Other then that, a great app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Ok, so I have a problem with my tiktok account. It started randomly I couple of days ago. So what happens is I log into tiktok and I can't click on any of my videos or anyone's profile or looking at comments without it kicking me out of the app!!!! And yes I already tried shutting it down, restarting it, clearing the cache, and deleting and reinstalling the app. Although when I reinstall the app it works until I log out of tiktokand log back in again."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My preferred social media platform. Ads aren't overbearing at all, with some being super relavent and actually interesting to watch. The suggestion algorithm has the perfect amount of relevant-not-relevant content for me to see both things I'm interested in and new things I may want to learn about. I have learned so much from this app, from global news to scientific breakthroughs. I wouldn't have any other platform to replace it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,SO I don't get alot of views on my tiktok live and I really don't think there should be some kind of shadow ban either and it would be nice if we can battle anyone instead of the similar creatirs because it's limiting us to just stay in our lane. Also I think they should fix the algorithm too so we can get more viewers in our live streams too. We need to go back in cashing out early instead of just Wednesdays. We need to buy grocery and stuff with what we earn. I hope things change wit algorithm
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I haven't got any 8 hour sleep bcs if this app. It's very distracting but it's not bad.....I guess 🙃
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"For the first time ever, after months of having the app, TikTok just crashed on me. I was offended but they must be doing something right if it's never crashed before. Endless hours of content. I get sucked in every evening before bed and stay awake 2+ hours more than I wanted to. I do have a suggestion though. Pressing the home button while scrolling thru the for you page instantly refreshes the page. Sometime I accidentally press it, maybe adding a refresh confirmation button when yu press?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's a very good app I won't lie at all and no matter what people say the app will still be used by everybody I don't think this app has any issues within my experience
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's very easy to go down the rabbit hole watching all these little videos . Just beware people will say "" THEY WANT YOU TO BE FRIENDS"" JUST TO TRY AND SCAM YOU SO BEWARE OF THAT . It's not just a tictoc problem it's all social media on the internet. Yet I still enjoy watching all the crazy videos."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Most of the time I try to edit a video it goes fine until when I'm on the last step of editing I write the caption and then it goes all glitchy and posts the video with no warning and also doesn't save it in drafts , and yes I always make sure tiktok is fully updated so it's not that and I also have a mid-end phone so it's not that the phone is glitching. Thats my only issue."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The Censoring of a lot of people discussing a particular topic. It's very unjust and disappointing of a app that usually promotes people's voices.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,App completely stopped working and it's definitely not my phone un-installed and not comein back to this brain rot
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App was fine but all of a sudden all my posts are getting 0 views, even when I watch it from another account. It seems like it's not shared on any pages nor subscription pages. This has been happening for 2 weeks and I've deleted and uploaded countless times, even different videos, still nothing.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Love the app but super frustrating that I can't see over half of the content because it deems it age inappropriate....I'm 28...with a 10 year old child and a mortgage. Just let me watch the videos! Troubleshooting does nothing to fix it, the preferences are set to unrestricted, and digital wellbeing is off. It's been almost two months with no change and no response from TT. disappointing."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"As a fellow ex musical.ly user i think the app is well made and stuff. I also really like how your preference adapts to your fyp and it could change anytime, everytime. Although its a good app, i have 2 things that might make it EVEN BETTER. 1st: Fricking add a button where we can see the duets of a video (The people who duetted/stitched that video) 2nd: Once you press ""add to favourites"" we should be able to make like folders thingys to organize our saved videos (favourites) Thats it 4 now ig!"

That's unfair in my eyes..you take it out, but don't replace it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Was a 5, but update wrecked editor for Android. The ""studio"" editing suite of features was amazing, but I updated the app and boom it's all gone. Tried several times to reinstall and get the editing features back, but apparently tiktok has been very inconsistent with features rollout. Some people have access (ios users maybe) and others get shafted. It's really inconvenient as a creator to have major features stripped away with no explanation or warning."

It s not just my face, because this works on my bf's android. I just downloaded a software update and it still has no effect, and gives me no error message or anything, just does not change. There is a slight airbrush on both halves of the screen but nothing more ."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app but the ""only"" problem is that it doesn't let me access the magnifying glass to search for filters, even if I contacted the Tiktok assistants they didn't give any useful solution, another thing It's how much it blocks and acts slowly but it could be a problem with my phone. Seriously, it is a good app since it has a wide variety of effects if you are a creator and content according to your tastes and the feed is quite easy to customize, the privacy and messages in the app are goo"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love me some tikkytokky. The only thing I recommend is that it needs better settings for saving my videos . There have been times where I will make a video and try to put it in my drafts , it tells me there's no space so I immediately will try to post it instead, just for it to deny the upload and completely delete my content. Fix that bug!"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Over all, good app. I have been having a problem where, when i try to save a video, ANY video, it would just cycle up from different percentages (ex. 14% to 57% to 90%) and it'd ""finish"" downloading but then it just restarts and freezes into a random percentage not downloading. I've tried everything, uninstalling, cleared cache, checked servers, i tested this is both of my accounts so it couldn't be that, i restarted my phone, and I have no clue what it is, and I've never had this problem."

I don't receive any notifications! I checked the app and all notifications are turned on, I even checked my phone and notifications are indeed allowed, and yet I recieve none what so ever. Not sure what I can do since I have attempted every single method provided for notifications but none have worked."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The community guidelines are practically non existent. When they do appear it is for the stupidest smallest thing. There are videos with explicit material which are not banned but sending a message with the word but is a violation of the guidelines. Tiktok is not in control and should be avoided.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They took away my ability to say I'm not interested in a video, and forced me onto the ""give me 4 notifications to manifest this"" side of tiktok. I'm not ok with not being able to get off of that side of the app. Uninstalling. I'm so disappointed. Not only that, it kills my phone worse than any other app, and constantly runs in the background no matter how many times I close it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app runs fine, it is fun and I get to enjoy a variety of content, but, and I don't know if I'm the only one this happens to, there are filters that don't work on my device, the app says it, it pulls up a little message, like I can't even open the record page when trying to use certain filters, not that they dont work on me, I am on a Samsung galaxy S21 FE btw Update: they have fixed whatever it was that was going on."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"TikTok has encoraged me someone who thought, in past years, that this was for people who either needed attention or has a new great idea to promote, and i never saw what my Grandchildren were so interested in to stare at their phones at all gatherings. But now T.T. has encouraging classes that teach me how to use tools, that T.T. provides, via Google. Simply created for my learning productability for earning money."

Although I've been have some trouble with one of the effects, The 'Ai Manga' effect will not let me access it. I've tried using it a few times but it keeps telling me that the effect isn't available on my device, I have a Samsung Galaxy A13, I don't know what the problem is. I really want to use the effect and it'd be nice if that would be allowed, thank you."

Voiceover is muted, captions muted, music muted. No sound. If i post, magically the sound is back. This makes for a terrible workflow and out of sync audio. I gave app all permissions so that's not in question. I use a samsung s10e. My phone is not that old. Fix this."

Except when i see all these videos of new updates i come to see if it needs a update and it doesn't, i dont end up getting the update. Overall this app is fun for boredem but the updates make it a bit weird."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Difficult to make effective videos. Everytime I try to make a video, I am always experiencing some kind of glitch, lag, or when I put on captions for those hard of hearing it is damn near impossible to make them effective and readable. Everytime I add captions they either A.) Don't load or B.) A thing comes on the screen that says ""Too many characters"" and now I have redo my entire editorial process that already took me an hour to do. Fix this. It's annoying as all hell."

I woke up this morning to my account being blank and all of my favorite videos and sounds gone. I tried uninstalling and then signing back in but it kept saying that my email wasn't valid or there was a server issue. When I tried reporting this issue it said that there was a 'Network' problem, my internet is fine btw. So dispite all of the tiktok adds tryin to show how easy, fun, and / or fun it is don't install this app is simply sucks."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,i only can login with browser. the app shows wrong errors. i report this bug with all detail to supporters and they did not answer. not a good experience at all
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Risky app. This app will slow your phone down. Audio will keep on playing after you close the app. It freezes your phone and makes other features unresponsive. It will not close when you want it to. I am using an android. I also do not like that it starts streaming videos as soon as you open app instead of taking you into a home menu.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a pretty good app but it takes up too much storage and uses too much wifi. It's also very addictive, if you don't have a lot of fans but if you have 1K and up then you barely post. If you're on this too much then you will run out of storage very quick (I've already used 99% just making tik toks) so that's just a little heads up if you're a begging."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The UI is horrible. I don't even have enough room to type out all of the problems I have had with this app so I will just add the most annoying problem. For some reason when uploading a video, even though I added hashtags in the caption, it just decided not to add them. And upon Googling the issue, I found that I can't even edit the video caption or add any hashtags after the video has been uploaded. So no one is going to see my video."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love the app, been using it for nearly a year. An issue that has happened before (though rarely) is that I upload a video and use a specific audio for said video and for some reason after uploading a video, it displays as an original audio when it isn't. I don't know if this is a rare bug or something."

Not every filter is supported if you don't have one and I have a pretty amazing camera but whenever I try to record something on the app, it decreases my quality and always makes my video out of sync as if I'm going too fast or slow for the audio. When I record it it's perfect but the finished video just looks like something I made on a potato"

Plus all of the little things that tik too does, like reminds to get a glass of water, or making sure every videos that's posted is appropriate for every user that could come. if you came across this app for whatever reason, like through a friend or an add, it is most definitely worth your time. Plus it's free! C'mon, you got nothing to lose!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"At no point did I touch the digital wellbeing setting, yet somehow it was enabled and it's impossible to disable it. I do not live with others, and I have not left my phone anywhere, so it's highly unlikely that someone else enabled it as a joke. This has happened before, and it spontaneously disabled after a few months, and then recently reenabled again. Incredibly frustrating."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love tiktok its my favourite app and I have so much fun with it! I would give it 5 stars there's just some issues that are really annoying which is why I haven't. For starters my duets didn't work. There was no option for me to turn on the microphone and therefore I couldn't duet people with audio. This has just randomly resolved itself which I'm happy about. The other thing is I can't add links to my bio where other accounts can. Don't know why this is but it's a little disappointing.

When I go through my collections of saved videos and try to remove one from the collection it says it's no longer saved but it's still there when it shouldn't be. The only way to fix this is to destroy the collection. Tiktok needs to fix this bug."

Things that aren't working so well: when I open a link in someone's bio I can't transfer it to Chrome. The web view is pretty useless and I'd like to have access to these sites outside of the app. Secondly, deep linking doesn't work. Don't try to send me to the app from the web if you're not going to take me to the right place."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Because it is the best but there's one probably is that the need to have it as you can watch it with no wifi
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The app was amazing in February-March. However right now(November) the fyp was reset after 3 months of not using the app. Now it offers me videos I don't like and after hours it only displays similar tiktoks that are often repeating. Also I had some problems like 'you are tapping too fast' that happened to me twice this month (that just started) so I couldn't like videos for maybe half a day.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like this app very much it is very addictive to watch on it. Sometimes it slows down and show me things that is not relevant to what I actually watch. Due to my great great great great grandfather watching tik tok a whole lot, he started pulling those ladies left and right cuz he had that RIZZ. Now finally I have a great great great great grandmother, now they have FIFTEEN HUNDRED CHILDREN.

Just as I finished the edit and was about to post it, TikTok glitched and I couldn't do anything. Thinking it would save my draft, I closed the app (I couldn't go back or anything from selecting the thumbnail for the video). I lost all of my progress. My video went back to square one of editing. I'm so frustrated. It's not the first time it's happened either. I'll just have to edit on a different app now... Smh."

If it's not one of those two categories, it's a person using a dumb filter to try and beat some record. I've hit not interested on so many of these things, and they keep showing up.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It has been really good for the most part, until i had update it to use it at its' fullest. Google play wasn't letting me update it after I cleared some space on my phone. It wasn't working properly and I had to unistall it and reinstall it to get it to work right. Sadly, when I did that I didn't realise it would delete my drafts in the process. Other than the draft deletion issue, I enjoy this app."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Disliking this app as they removed mysound option.. Make a point: This app will not survive if you don't add back the mysound option.. We can't make the videos with the existing audio tracks for ever.. We need to have the ability to make videos with new audio tracks.. Otherwise Creativity will cut down and we are left with repeating the acting for the same audio tracks again and again..

As I live in a country where I don't fluently speak the local language, I'm only shown videos in a language I can't understand. There's no way to change this. Even using a VPN, disabling location services, changing the timezones, turning off my local sim card, the app can still somehow know exactly where I am, which is weirdly invasive - it's clear they are not respecting my privacy settings."

I can't get rid of it either, every time I scroll it stays until I close the app and reopen it which is very annoying whenever I'm trying to enjoy content from creators I enjoy. This isn't even addressing the lack of prioritization when it comes to making Android having the same features as iPhone, not to mention the sheer amount of lag that comes with it. I'm genuinely so tired of this."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I browse Tiktok frequently and create content but I have complaints. Tiktok is taking down or removing sounds from videos that are considered ""too harsh"" when other videos with questionable content merely have a content warning. There should be the option to choose if content was for a young audience or not. Whenever I go to the friends section, it glitches and goes black, rendering it useless. Often the save to a collection button is missing, only to reappear later. YouTube has better options."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I hate this app so much. I hated it before I willingly looked at context from it. I see the ads so much and I hate the ads. There was even an ad before a movie in the movie theater. This app managed to get to the top of my most hated list so fast. I don't even care that I haven't seen really anything from the app expect the from the ads. In comparison, I didn't care for musicly, or however it's name is, but I didn't hate it because it didn't have so many ads. If I had one wish, I would be tempted to use it to never see an ad for this app again. That's how much anger this has been giving me with how often I see it. The last time I had this experience was the day where there was basically only Jason Borne ads. (Though my actual wish would by a phone of my specifications, assuming no limits applied to the wish. Infinity storage, data (or always connected at top speed), best camera.)(now that I got all that out I feel alot calmer now.)"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have been using the app and creating content for about eight months. While it is fun to scroll, this app really needs a way for creators to recover lost drafts. I've filmed probably 10 drafts in the last month or two that were deleted because I accidentally clicked a notification or something. It's irritating to spend time filming and editing something that gets instantly deleted if I leave the creator portal without hitting ""Save draft"". Also, upload speeds are WAY down."

I am extremely agitated because the only way to fix this problem is having to uninstall the app (which I did previously and it's happening again) I would really appreciate if you would sort to this matter because I don't want to lose my drafts again. it's been working perfectly, but now I can't even go into the app. do better."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Idk what happened with the latest update, but now I can't edit my drafts without losing the audio completely. I'm a cosplayer who does transitions and lip syncs to the audio. I can't review changes I make to videos and the ""add audio"" button on the recording screen is grayed out. Please resolve this so I can get back to making content I enjoy. Furthermore, captions are missing on all videos. What happened?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I like tiktok as it is just the lifesaver of paying for netflix like staawwwppp
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I think the app is great but.. The problem is that I updated it and my videos kept pausing half way which is annoying. The other problem is that when I upload edits that take a lot of time, they don't get much likes and it annoying cause people take lots of time on them to only get 11-56 likes. Honestly I don't really like this update at all its confusing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Entertainment purposes only... it's a great distraction for me because I'm in pain all day everyday day. Thank you for the rabbit hole I find myself in after watching @UniqueNaay do hair, listening to old school mixes on the many DJ lives or watching the many beautiful and remarkable dogs, art, woodwork, cooking etc... Thank you for Entertainment 😜"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Some features are missing for some people. It's very unfair that I can not see the layout option for the duets in order to make it horizontal. I don't have that button. And I see many horizontal deuts however they are only made with people who have tons of followers and likes. That's disappointing and it feels very wrong for them to do this. I uninstalled and re-installed to make sure it was up to date and STILL no layout option for the duets. Also, some peoples Instagram links are not working."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"TikTok is no longer the same, it literally doesn't show the videos in ""for you"" anymore. I had a problem with an account and they never solved it, apart from the fact that it shows me content in Spanish and I want it to be in English. 🐢💢"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm having trouble with saving some of the tik toks, it's one of the bugs. Hopefully it gets fixed. But overall. It's a pretty good app. I'm kind of wishing that some filters and such could be available to all devices other than iPhones. Another issue is that it has poor professionalism since it doesn't often deal with accounts or videos that are going against the guidelines that need to be removed. Another thing is that It would be more enjoyable if there was a history option in the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app sucks after the most recent update. Constantly tells me can't connect or no Internet connection. Or search terms come up error or empty. Pixel 7 pro on Android 14
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It used to work great but suddenly most of my effects and ""try this effect button"" on others videos have disappeared. I only have a handful of effects and most are Xmas and New Years. I've asked 3 times for help on the app and all they do is say ""Thank you for the feedback"". It has been months, now I just view toks and not make them :("
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like the app a lot. I seem to be pretty active on tiktok these days, more so than Facebook and Twitter combined. My only complaint is the lack of a full dark mode. I know there's talk about it being in development but until then, using forced dark mode thru the developer options is a hassle since it has issues inverting black and white images to monochrome negative on multiple apps. With so many preferring the dark mode option, you'd think all apps would have it as an aption by now."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Every time when i open the app it show me the login display again and again . I am tired from this
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Have had problems with this app since downloading it. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, updated, tried using web suggestions to fix, and nothing has worked. I don't get any notifications to my phone, so I have to go into the app to see if I have any messages/likes/comments. I don't have the option to add playlists. And I have tried to contact TikTok to get this resolved multiple times, and they don't help or simply don't respond."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Enjoy the app, but it is missing some of the features from the IPhone version. Once you follow someone their content basically disappears for ever"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Received an invite to add my podcast RSS feed, but I'm getting an error message. I've reached out to TikTok twice with support tickets which they just ignore. I also have a lot of problems using green screen videos and gifs. They just don't load. Super frustrating. Also have the same issue another user pointed out below, volume leveling just doesn't work. Sounds good when I record, but once posted it changes."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is good but I just had a huge problem. It was fine earlier on the day but I just tried opening and now it just didn't want to. Crashed before it actually opened. I got a popup saying ""TikTok keeps stopping"" and I just hit Ok and it happens again. I tried to force stop and it didn't work, tried to see if there was an update I needed to get and there was none and I even tried to clear the cache of the app but for some reason nothing happened when I tried. Had to uninstall to see if works."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Love the creators and content but the app itself needs an update. No notifications (yes, I've checked the settings) and when I do receive a notification it's a random page I don't even follow or a video that's months old. The amount of lives I've missed because there was no notification is a joke! Clear mode was a joke, it was there for about 5 videos then suddenly disappeared again and now there's random pop-ups. Also the random friend suggestions, you're not Facebook, leave it alone."

It lags and kicks me out of the app and takes me back to the home screen. It's been working perfectly fine until today.. I re-download the app and tried but it still wouldn't budge. I even tried restarting my device yet it still refuses.. Please fix this problem, Tiktok.. It's really irritating. Thank you."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I will give this app a 3 because most of the times there are bots and they keep liking my videos and comments and I want actual people to do that. And the worst part is that tiktok isn't doing anything about it. I work hard on my videos, but all their gonna promote is the viral tiktokers videos. I give up, and I'm done being ignored. So this app is a 3. I did this 2 months ago and my opinion changed this app is a 4 now🫶"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have killed countless hours on this app, but I really wish they wouldn't have programmed the app to never sleep. Beware pausing your feed to go do something. Because it doesn't sleep, the app icons will burn into your display over time. Also I hate it when you accidentally hop to your profile; when you go back, your fyp refreshes. I don't know how many times I was getting into a video only to lose it forever by accidentally tapping my profile."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The problem is I cannot post a picture when I do it males it like a video and that is not good . Please can someone help....
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"New bug where two videos play at once, the background one can't be paused, and I have to restart the app. For a global company so widely used, who's harvested the data of nearly every American in the country, I find it hard to believe you guys can't make a decent app that works more often than not. There's always something new wrong, your new features suck, and the app just isn't good. I would never touch TikTok if not for family and friends sending me videos on it. Absolutely horrible."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Alright, tiktok. We need to talk. You're app is great and all, but I apparently can not send videos to my bf.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love the app and the content but I can't tell you how many times I've tried to put a tiktok in my favorites so I can remember to follow up on a series and have accidentally hit ""not interested"". I mess up my algorithm and there seems to be no way to undo that. There should either be an undo button after an action like that or a second box after you hit not interested that lets you confirm so people have a chance to fix it! It really throws off my experience."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Very good app. I like to spend time here when I am bored. This app though needs some improvements and optimization for android... The phone gets very hot. In every phone model from Samsung to Apple, the phone gets hot the minute after the app is opened... Very frustrating and it drains the battery... Please fix that and it'll make the overall experience better for not only me but for everyone. Please!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've had a lot of fun with the content so far, but I just got a S22 Ultra and pretty much any filter I've wanted to try after seeing a trend is not available on the device. Apparently Tiktok not being fully compatible with Samsung is not a new thing and disappointing to say in the least. Don't know why you guys wouldn't care to make sure your app worked correctly for everybody regardless of what company made the phone"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Okay, don't get me wrong, I love this app, but there's some things that seriously have to change/still need a little work. To start with, is there any way to make organizing folders a little easier?! I have some RLY old videos down towards the bottom of my saved videos, that I'd RLY like to find, but am severely struggling with. I'm the kind of person that saves a lot of videos, thats why I have 54k of them saved!! I'd like to finally organize them, but unfortunately can't😒"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have posted videos more than 1K. Most of the videos are in good clarity but that doesn't go viral and will not get likes for that. If a girl jumps or do anything with bad videos, that will go viral not the one's videos who used to work hard to achieve it. So many bugs are still there..the slow motion is also not good in this ..wish you could look over it soon...and try to add slow motion feature like in btwn 3 to 4 places in the TIKTOK video...not only in one place."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"One step forward and two steps back. What happened to the watch history option. You press a button by mistake and will never get back to a video you missed again. Cannot read captions. There was a brief update where the caption was visible in the comment section. Bring it back! I would like to save some videos, but I do not want them in my camera folder. Most apps have their own download folders."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Still hard to figure out all the features and also being able to get views. Sometimes my videos get alot other times hardly any..
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I am unable to save my songs on tiktok then usage of them is very difficult. Always I am unable to find my save music collection which is why I am unable to upload any videos.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,They tanked the state-of-the art algorythem to censor Pali stinian voices and gave cencorship control to fascist governments. Every other video is an insufferable add. Each update cheapens the experience. Notably the back function reloads the fyp so it's no longer possible to see what you were just looking at. Most of the videos are not saved on the watch history tab which makes it impossible to find anything prevalent or maintain a cohesive narrative. Disappointed not surprised 0/5 do better.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Last time I downloaded it it worked perfectly. Then I deleted it because of my insuficient storage space. When I downloaded it again, ot was the updated version and I couldnt use own music. I had to search for it. But my dad banned me from using the wifi so I was stuck not being able to use it. I am so very dissapointed. So Im giving you one last try by downloading it again.😕"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Worse app ever... it's trying to connect to my wifi. 12/30/23 still doing it.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Add a Dark Mode and fix the ""Not Interested"" function. There is no Dark Mode for Android and there should certainly be one by now. Also, the ""Not Interested"" function is broken. I keep pressing ""Not Interested"" on certain creators and videos; but instead of showing less from those creators, I see more. The same for videos. I don't want to see animals killing other animals, but when I click ""Not Interested"" or report those videos, I come across them more often."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Tik tok doesn't show the videos based on the language you select and location. Instead it has the access to your SIM card and it shows videos according to that. For suppose if you select English language and you denied location still it shows the videos of your regional language (based on SIM card location) . Be ware guys it's a kind of data robbery.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,They have that effect called raindrop control where you would move your hand and big bubbles would appear in the video and now it doesn't work anymore. I don't know if it doesn't work because of an update but you need to bring that feature back ASAP. Because it wasn't working I uninstalled and reinstalled the app and I lost over 70 drafts that I had saved which took me hours to make. Could please return my drafts and fix the effect button I would really appreciate it thanks

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I advise you to save the most current videos we've watched. Since it's challenging to locate the video and pick up where we left off if we accidently touch the back button or any other button in the middle of the video. Please take this into consideration as a significant issue for numerous users. Thanks

I get so many new craft,home improvement and cooking ideas from this app ! some things should be improved like giving the option to cast videos onto other devices so other arpund you can watch too. Also i think it would be helpful to be Able to edit videos after they are uploaded because too many times ive had to delete the work i put into a video because something was misspelled or forgotten"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The only way to replay a video, is by swiping up or down, and then swiping back to the video you want to rewatch. When you first start the app, the first video you watch, you can't rewatch it if you try to swipe down and then back up to to watch the original video. If you swipe down, it refreshes the app and the video is gone. I've lost tons of videos I wanted to show someone, and that's why I tried to swipe down, but then poof! Gone forever. I switched to YouTube shorts. They don't have that."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Lately I'm not able to use half of the filters. I just bought a new galaxy S20 and it's really frustrating because I could use them before. Please fix this because I'm sure I'm not the only one having this problem. I don't understand why it's happening. So TikTok just keeps getting wilder and wilder. Sometimes it works good then other times it's a mess. Now when I click a filter it takes me to greenscreen and then it doesn't save my favorite songs/audio for later use so annoying

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been having issues with being selectively given strikes on your app. For posting the same trends I have seen wide across your app for weeks. Every time I try to report an issue it shows me network error. And it is not because I have a network error, that only pops up when I try to hit the send button. I see other videos just fine and i post fine. I have tried for 3 days to send reports, as if tictok does not want to hear from me. Pathetic that they wont listen to their own users honestly."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Nice content very buggy app. For example half the time clicking on creator icon just shows blank screen. Switching by swiping right automatically plays wrong audio (it's the same as video you were on, so you get new video and wrong audio). It's a mess. P.s. problems still persist. 100500 steps required to actually report them are not helping. Seriously add a freaking text field to ""describe a problem"" instead of 5 levels of menus and NOT being able to report the bug in the end. Horrible UX"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app, but few things I personally would love to see: A feature to create playlist(s) for every videos, not just for mine only; a feature to remove all unavailable videos in ""Favorites"" at once; A feature to sort out all my Favorite vids by day added/posted/etc. OR custom (could add this feature in the playlist feature instead); an update where the search filters ACTUALLY work right; dark mode option for Androids; a filter to sort videos in a tag based on date posted, views, popularity, etc."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Mostly random 'funny' videos like on 100 other sites/apps. What actually annoys me here is that half the uploads end in the middle and the uploader wants you to like it to see the rest or a part 2 as they call it. So no content I wanna see really. The app itself works just fine. The layout, usability and overall user experience is good. So thanks to UX for this. 3 stars for app developing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is amazing I did have some glitches happen while using the app. For example when you press the bottom to record a video with a sound.

This glitches has been occurring for about one month and a half some think it work but not often.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Like the app, but features not there. The current trend is the voice changer, but I can't get it no matter how hard I try. I update, I uninstall and reinstall. This happens with literally every trend feature within this app - I never get them. Why? Is it because I have Android? It makes me not want to create videos, despite having over 4000 followers, because i can never follow the trends and can't create good content without the features. I wish features were consistent across all phones."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"this app sucks. often when i search a sound that my friend has on her account, i search it but i can't find it. it also lags a lot and is very slow. my phone often sends me notifications saying either ""tik tok is slowing your phone"" or ""a virus has been detected"". a lot of my friend's accounts dont appear if i search their name. it also deletes some of my videos randomly. mostly the ones in my drafts. get this screwed up app fixed. remember this is my personal experience."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App is good/easy to use, but content is trash. It's highly addictive and bad for your mental health. It tracks everything you watch, knows how much you pay attention to it, and collects ungodly amount of personal data. Refrain from using such an app. It's also bloat ware on new phones and who knows how much they paid for that spot to get YOUR attention."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When you sign in and stuff the first time it's very easy but if you make videos and stuff it deletes them for absolutely nothing but it says ""community guidelines"" and then when you have to sign in again it always says incorrect password and it's stupid. But as far as that it's pretty good I guess. If you don't make videos you will really like it though"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The concept is great but the actual app is just straight-up bad. When it actually decides to run, the first couple of videos are always a slideshow until the app catches up with itself. Half the features don't work even when it does actually manage to play 3 videos in a row without freezing (shout out to the watch and comment history which have never worked and have only ever instantly crashed the app). So yeah, great idea, you just need monk-like patience or a super computer to use the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's an entertaining app, great to have fun and have a good distraction. Adding to that is also informative and educational to a point. I don't consider it kids friendly, remember kids are unpredictable, will recommend if they are being supervised or interacting with parents . On the other hand when it comes to opportunities for new creators trying to grow a new kind a thing the system makes it hard for them. With that I can say that if it gives new niches and opportunity to Grow."

Fyi, it's not my WiFi or my phone as every other app works fine it's just tiktok"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Some how people are using an app to buy bots for views and likes and followers etc and totally ruining other content creators live streams and getting mass reported or banned and losing viewers, but after blocking b. O. T. S the views on their live stream go back up. It's happening to literally EVERYONE on the app... and people are getting violations for no reason and can't appeal them.. 😒 seriously this needs to stop its been going on maybe the last 9 months.."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Truly a terrible app. So predatory and manipulative. Keeps playing videos when you're pressing the back button to try to close it also uses a ton of data in the background. I pay by the gigabyte and this month's cell phone bill is going to be really high cuz I did not notice it was just using my data without my expressed permission. I've hardly used the app at all what it is doing in the background that is so data hungry is a mystery.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I use the ""not interested"" feature every time I open tiktok, and it still recommends the same irrelevant content and creators. I make sure to go to details and specify if it is a sound I don't want recommended or a creator, but it doesn't matter. Every day, same people, same sounds, and no end in sight. I have submitted a ticket in the app with screenshots, but there was no response from CSR. If I like one video by someone, my fyp is their entire channel. It makes me want to barf!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The best algorithm social media has to offer.. you literally are choosing ur own audience, connection, genre or whatever youre interested in. Very good at picking up on what you usually like to watch, see or hear. Youre rarely ever getting thrown any and everything at you to see all the time, especially things you probably won't even like. Basically, it's great here that youre own algorithm is perfect for you because it lessens the chance of getting your spirit broken or energy lowered."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok is a great app and has become a part of my daily social media life. It is a great community and you can always find something that interests you. Recording videos is the coolest thing ever. I love how the music is playing while you record, and how you can edit clips later on. It has so many functions. I gave only four stars because tiktok also has its dark sides, with inappropriate things. But there is more good stuff than bad. The community is the best thing ever."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Most fun app EVER. I have had so much fun on Tiktok and am so happy to have it during the pandemic. Somethings can improve over time. My couple requests or suggestions at the moment would be to possibly view videos using the sound through your favorite list. And second mabe having another list to save videos to like (save for later to try/duet) cause it can take a while to look through your liked list to find that one video 😜.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Its great for a social media platform however I've been experiencing some problems lately: when I record with an audio that's let's say abt 20 seconds, I can only record 5 seconds of it even if I tap the 60 second option. Another huge problem is that none of my liked videos are showing, if I like a video and go to the liked video area, it won't show."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love tiktok a lot, it's really addictive and I can watch it for hours. But I'm giving it only 3 stars because it keeps taking away my photo mode! For months I didn't have any slideshow videos come up, I couldn't even watch them. Then I got to make slideshows and they came back to my fyp for about a week. Then gone again. Randomly about a month ago (without updating the app) they came back for me to watch but I can't make any slideshows! I also cannot open my drafts of slideshow videos 😒😒"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Freezing up. Most videos are freezing up during the middle of playback and it's aggravating. And I even updated the app and still nothing. I'm afraid this app is falling apart Videos still freezing up. Not sure why, but a lot of them are. I finally had to drop my review to a two star because videos still hanging up in the middle of playback. Voice continues, but not with the video Sorry, but when every video starts freezing up, then I have to drop to a single star This app keeps getting worse"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"doesn't open, makes my phone lag to hell everytime I try to open it, and I have to restart my phone every time I attempt. It drains my battery tons and makes my phone warm everytime too. Generally unusable and I don't plan on coming back until this issue is fixed. It's not my cache/internet and I know that for a fact. Only thing that's helped is reinstalling but the issue came back before the end of the month. Not even demanding games like CRK have this issue for me, so I doubt it's my phone."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love buying off of tiktok shops but I hate paying shipping. Even when they advertise there is free shipping if you buy a certain amount, I still don't get it. So aggravating and I guess I won't be buying anything 😭"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Been experiencing lots of bugs recently. Most recent is for over 2 days now I cannot open the app. It immediately crashes when trying to launch it. I've tried pretty much everything possible that I could find except for uninstalling (since it deletes drafts if you uninstall). I've tried multiple times getting in contact with tiktok support and they've either been unresponsive or sent me in circles. I'll change my rating IF this can be fixed!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best app I've installed in yrs. The app runs beautifully on my Samsung phone, never had a problem with it in the past 3 yrs. I think some of the reviews on here, people don't understand the problem is with their device/connection, not the app. Anyway, there's such a variety of interesting content, it's like a vast, cultural portal to the world. I have learned so much & made many friends, from people just like me, to others who live completely differently from myself. Beautiful. Thank you TikTok."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love to talk, especially because you can make your account private, if they're like a little kid, but yeah, look like you could make more quest.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"My following page is gone. Whenever I want it back so I can see the content creators I actually like, I have to uninstall and reinstall the app so I can view it the first time- as soon as I close the app it's gone. Plus, just now, there was a bug that wouldn't even open the app, AND the app harassed you to connect your FB, contacts, etc."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Sad to give this app 2 stars but omg there's a lot of problems right now. First of all, where's the dark mode? It's legitimately 2023 and there's no dark mode. Also, what happened to the scroll bar at the bottom of the screen used to rewind or fast forward videos. Nobody ever complained about that feature and considering how bad TikTok's ui is, a single accidental swipe in any direction could mean having to rewatch potentially minutes of a video just to get back to the part you left off on."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is very enjoyable and fun to use but I have had a few issues... whenever you are scolling through after some time it will say ""tapping to fast take a break"" which i find highly annoying. I also dont think it is a great softwear to create and edit your videos on. There are not many ways to edit mainly when it comes to time effects... Overall it is an enjoyable app that you will download as a joke but becomes addicting... 💁"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I do love this app but it's frustrating the hell out of me since I can't search or use all these effects!!! I don't have the little search icon in the effects bar next to saved effects and the clear effect icons.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've had no complaints with this app but as of lately all of my videos have been buffering. The app is updated, my phone is updated, and I'm on my Wi-Fi network at home on my couch. Still, some videos will buffer and not load, even after scrolling up AND down a few videos, and even waiting. They don't play. I end up just skipping them. I hope TT can fix these issues."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok has been getting more and more ridiculous. The constant horrible live videos, the ads made to look like other videos, the weird follow page that you can't skip, and now they've removed the watch History option? If you're going to randomly reset so I lose my place after leaving for only a minute, you have to bring back that watch History option or I'm going to have to stop going on to the app. Also I don't want to connect to my irls on here so stop asking."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is quite controversial, and it can often lead down rabbit holes, but it is a generally fun app to have. It can be educational, and it is very easy to customize what you see."

But as soon as I post the video itself, the audio is all there. This makes it very frustrating to make any kind of content, and I'm noticing others have the same issue. Tiktok staff have gotten back to me, but even with the troubleshooting tips, nothing has changed. Hopefully, this gets resolved soon"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I LOVE TikTok. Such a fun and entertaining app. I can't even remember a time without it. Just so much fun to learn the dance choreos or get inspiration for cooking and baking. The filters are also the best on the market. And it's free.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's great until all the updates that make the app better get removed. (Bring back add a comment to the repost)

Makes me think Swift pays you guys to boost her popularity on the algorithm."

For example, i import a video, i always review it before i post just in case i make a mistake. And yes, the only mistake i only see is that it glitches, and i don't know how to fix this.

In the last few days, when i open the app, after few fast scrolls, it freezes the whole screen with the sound blasting, until i scroll away and close it. With few other minor bugs, i always have to check the Play Store for updates and then the same thing happens sometime later. It's absurd and... not great. At all."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When I search stuff I no longer get the tip videos just the users, hashtags, and sounds. It's super annoying when I'm trying to find a sound, or a person who's user I don't remember, or a specific type of videos, etc. It's literally infuriating and making me think about just deleting it. Hopefully they fix this because my friends isn't like this, but it's super annoying."

I see the tik tok logo when pressing on the app but then it just goes to a black screen and crashes. I've had this problem before, a few months back and solved it by deleting and reinstalling the app. I guess I'll just do that again, but it would be great if whatever problem is causing this could be lifted as it's not great to lose all my drafts with the deletion."

But i also think that it is a good way to meet new people, be comfortable adound other people and show off talents. I only rated it 3 🌟 because there are things that I think they could improve on.

However there are a few flaws that have been apparently fixed now, but I still deal with the issues, as many others I know.

Especially since the first tap reorients the screen and brings up the comments, then you have to tap again, in a different spot, to pause the music. Also the slide scrolls so quickly you can barely look at it. I just skip the slides now, which sucks cause they were a bearable addition before and now they are just infuriating.

After I leave a comment the keyboard opens up and closes multiple times unless I exit the comment section and go back in and sometimes a video will be playing fine but the moment I like the video it freezes or lags and the audio continues. I've never had these issues before and since I updated the app its been doing this
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It didn't used to be so bad but now two out of three videos are commercials. Every time. So you have to watch two commercials to get to watch one video
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Im really getting frustrated. I've only had the app for about a year and this problem has been evident from the start. When I start to make a video and put it in my drafts, I can't seem to go back to it and edit it properly. It only lets me add stickers or text and if I chose to edit the actual video it just discards it. I also can't seem to adjust clips once I add them in? Which is just as frustrating. I've tried everything and nothing will work. Please help!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is an amazing app,but the reason I gave it a 4-star is that you can't go live without 1000 followers,And the creators should have almost 50-100 followers to go live so please fix this."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I just downloaded tiktok again after a few days of having it deleted, but now I can't even open the app. I'll click on it and it will pop up with an error message saying tiktok keeps stopping and then it'll kick me out of the app. I've tried resetting my phone, redownloading the app, and even force stopping the app, but nothing is working. Normally a great app but until I can actually use it again, only 1 star."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. think it's great to use and all but I do have a small problem that really isn't that big of a deal but it is kinda annoying. And this could possibly be just my phone acting up, but every time I'm using the app and scrolling for a while, the app just closes or it freezes for a minute and then the app closes and idk why. It could be just my phone or maybe all the updates it has been getting lately, but I thought I should just let you guys know. ☺"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've had this app since covid. When adding color to the font, it does nothing. So I'm stuck with a basic look when adding caption to my videos."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,request I have always love this app. I've been on it for maybe 2 or 3 years. It certainly made covid lockins a lot more bearable! However as of recent the lagg on the lives and audio issues while recording a video thru the app are almost unbearable. The voice doesn't line up with the live I'm watching now. There's like. 3 to 5 second delay between the sound and their lips a lot! Please please fix this. My ADD can't take it My account noor malik
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Tik Tok is a good app but it has a problem that it can't live in Pakistan we need to solve this problem by Tik Tok team.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Every time I post a video no one see it , it's seems like a problem , and team support no one answer"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Whenever I update the app it always won't let me enter it every time I try to it just crashes and it had been happening from the month before I tried deleting it and re-downloaded it, it works like that but it's to much because I have to re-enter my account and put the password. I would like this bug to be fixed as soon as possible, thank you."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Its a great and fun way to connect with you peers. But it always seems to say 'your tapping to fast take a break' and then you can't like peoples posts and you never see the posts again if you refresh. It's also really sad when you have to have 1000 followers to go live. I really wish it was lower like 500 or something because alot of people can't go live. Over all this app is really good and really easy to use.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's good platform that serves many purposes, though it's a time killer due to addiction for a lot of us. It's still great as far as Education is concerned though some unscrupulous individuals are misusing it to promote their nonsense."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Im still having trouble with the app it works for a few days then I have to download and reinstall it because it keeps telling me there's connection issues when there's nothing wrong with my connection. Can't access the app. Have all updates and my cache is cleared. Even deleted and re-download the app several times. I've sent in emails and even sent DMs on Twitter and still no response cant even access the help through the app because it won't load.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app keep on muting videos, deleting likes and repost, and deleting follows beside shadow banning content. Tiktok, do better."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's great for engaging in different genres but it keeps ""updating"" to add useless things to the app that makes it annoying and hard to use."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,My videos are not showing when I upload videos with my poco F4 but they appear when I upload it from my note 9s Whyyyyy?
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Editing videos doesn't work; if you want to retake a portion of the video the audio is wrong or doesn't play at all so if you're lip syncing you gotta guess?? Drafts don't work all the videos in my drafts are now just a black screen... glitches ALWAYS and lip syncing isn't even an option it's way off so you look silly when your mouth doesn't match the words 😶 all used to work perfectly in 2021 but seems to be getting worse and worse 2022
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Awesome 💯 TikTok is a really nice app to watch videos on. You can watch over a 100 videos, you can watch any videos too. I don't know about any other people but this app is the best scrolling app I've ever had on my mobile phone👌"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I shouldn't have to go into developer mode on my phone just to force dark mode for tiktok, but they decided not to have a built-in dark mode setting that, for some reason, only exists on the iPhone version. I would also have liked to change my pfp, but the network I have, that I use for online multiplayer and downloading/uploading other more demanding media, is apparently too unstable to upload a small cropped down image."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"TikTok is a fun app, there's just some problems. When I make a TikTok, I set the duration, it puts me into a whole clip, and when I edit where I Wanna put my text, it won't let me. I really like how y'all had the duration last time, because it wasn't complicated, and really easy to use. If you would just make the editing easier to how it been was, that would be great for me."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love tiktok, but some of the random bots in comment sections or liking my comments are so annoying. Edit: The sound doesn't sync up with my Samsung like it used, if I wear bluetooth headphones it syncs up (which should be the opposite), but other than that my phone doesn't sync up to me whenever I make videos. Tiktok lags and crashes way too often now, after a certain amount of time it crashes smh."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is really fun! This is a good app of you want to see what friends and family are doing that day (if they make a video) there is many sounds to chose from and if you don't find the sound you are looking for you can make your own!!! There is effects, sawys you can edit and more!!! This is a good app if you want to be youself and just have fun."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Was working fine..then recently it updated now its so slow..only plays the video the app opens with and wont let me swipe up to the next..just the spinny ball thingy at the bottom and nothing
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's fun, you meet awesome people, 😜 I love goofing off with everyone. It's a lot of fun, entertaining 😁"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"For years have used tiktok and have gained a lot from it it's the best app for fun,teaching and business"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I really used to love this app but it is so buggy now that it makes it no fun to use. NONE of the effects work on my phone. I have the Galaxy Z Flip 3 so it doesn't make sense why I lost my effects but my S10+ didn't have any issues. I also can't edit sounds or even use text on my videos anymore. Watching tiktoks is one thing but being able to make videos with all of the features is what pulled me into the app in the first place. This has to be fixed before I try to use it again. Very sad.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is amazing. I come Errors accur while using the app. For the example when you press the button to record. Video with sounds🔊 when the sound plays. The camera is only site never been like this. This the error is happening for about 1 mouth. And a half. Some time it's works but not often. I Anyway record video anytime but I do. However post bro. Viral my videos 📝thanks. Criket video 📹post in anytime thanks
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app is so buggy. Randomly it just stops opening and I have to uninstall and reinstall it. I've now had to do so 6 times.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"4 star because we still can't add multiple sound and/or music without a 3rd party app and it would be also great if I could save my videos without the watermark, especially after having many many ads. The latest update is good, I like to have more and more editing options, it feels more professional now and it still fairly easy to use. Would recommend it still to anyone."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Whenever I open tiktok it works for a few weeks maybe a few months but then it just stops starting up
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"every month or so, id have to uninstall tiktok because whenever id press on the app, the tiktok logo would come up, and then id be back on my home screen. And that would happen to the point where i was clicking on the app, and nothing was happening. And yes i have gone onto the playstore to see if i just needed to update the app, but nope, it just said open, which i did try but again it didn't work. I think this bug is ridiculous. I want it fixed and i want it fixed soon."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Everything works just fine except for the occasional lagging which has to be fixed. Sometimes it plays the sound of a previous video i watched in place if the current video I'm watching and when I duet I've realized that my end of the sound doesn't come. I've updated twice , tried uninstall and reinstall but to no avail Please fix it Excluding that,it's an amazing app"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Yall sux. It constantly crashes and it causes your phone to glitch. Not worth it
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The app has had its ups and downs but for the past couple of months i have been very happy with the app. One of my favorite things about it was the collections you can make of videos and the picture of the collection would be the first video there i had organized all my 28 collections to be a video that id like as the picture of the album however today they changed it that the newest video is the picture. I absolutely hate this and it honestly ruins half the app. PLEASE FIX THIS.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The biggest issue in TikTok's new update is creating a title in Urdu on top of the video. Each word of the title written in Urdu is automatically separated. And then the video title is forced to be written in English, which many users do not understand. So re-install this new update with improvements ."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Nice experience using this app. I've connect with people around the world. But the only challenge I have is that my videos don't go viral or reach large numbers of viewers.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Its brilliant but of u don't wanna do videos u don't have to ucan watch or go live its fun (:
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a very good app,it can upload both video and photos clearly and with all kinds of effects. Continue with the same"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My phone is always hanging each time I open the app which is so frustrating. If only TikTok lite possessed all the features of TikTok I would have switched over to it. Live videos are nothing to write home about,it will always hang. At first I thought it was network issues but it never changed. From time to time it says,'Tiktok is not responding,(close app,wait,send feedback)'. It's quite frustrating and I keep wondering if other people experience this or is the problem from my phone."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I really like tiktok and one thing that I most like about it. is that if you're on TikTok to much or your scrolling to much it will give you a video that you should take some deep breaths.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Wish 3 things would change. 1. The ability to turn off and not recieve anymore notifcations of likes and comments on videos I commented on weeks ago. 2. The ability to Like videos and put certain ones into a folder that I want to go back to watch again later and not have to scroll through 500 of my previous likes to get back to one of my favorites. 3. The ability to filter out videos about Politics etc. I've just seen enough the last year. I'm done with it.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Can't record my own voice after choosing a sound. Tiktok had temporarily fixed this issue by allowing us to turn the mic on or off, and setting the volume for each. Even though I turned automatic updates OFF, TikTok still removed this feature, which makes it more difficult to sync my speech with the sound. This also impacts duets. BRING IT BACK! I removed a star because of this issue. UPDATE: I have submitted THREE tickets as of 11/16/20 (Aug., Oct., Nov.)"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I can't see when my friends are on lives and I am not getting notifications of them going live. When is this going to be fixed!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Used to spend tons of time scrolling because the algorithm was nice. Now TikTok shop being pushed has completely ruined this app. Instead of getting an ad every 10 or so videos it's every 2 or 3. And it's often for the same 3 products over and over (for me it's been teeth whitening, bodysuits, and makeup. All things to make me 'more beautiful'). Extremely frustrating and intrusive!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I was thinking that it was maybe my phone or my wifi connection because I have exactly been experiencing the same issues or bugs and crashing without even opening the app itself, sometime it will just be on the TikTok page indefinitely without opening the app. I have tried restarting my phone couples of time but still does the same. Reading the reviews below, I noticed that I'm not the only one. What happening with tik tok??? Developers are you taking tik tok off the media? Let us know at least"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Its a very democratic, and socialist expierience. My comments are often deleted for stating an oppinion or correcting a publisher. I do like to listen to some of the musicians and watch some of dancing but all in all its really not good."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love tiktok it's fun but it is also washing our brains also it can be really slow, but it is also an app that I can go on and have fun but it is also an app that you have to be juged to fit in so honestly its hit or miss lol 😂 but I really like the app itself"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"First things first. The creators of this app does absolutely nothing. They sometimes just stand there while music plays. I thought I would be able to see cool tik tok dances that everyone is doing and a lot better content! Second, it brainwashes your mind. To get this straight there a many talented and skilled people in tik tok. But the content it comes from this app is the opposite of that. From what I have seen. Third, too much ads. In yt, and games It pisses me off. The ads aren't even good!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After a few days of use, videos started glitching. I deleted the app and reinstalled it. When I tried logging back in it wouldn't let me. Apparently, my account was deactivated (I have no idea why, I do not post any videos and rarely comment. I have nothing against Community guidelines.). I followed instructions to reactivate it, but then the app said my email wasn't associated with an account (despite my receiving promotional materials there). I reached out to support and they didn't respond."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Legit my favorite social media platform but PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD stop keeping pushing out these mini updates. I swear they're not making the app better but worse (imo).
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I love the app, but unfortunately it no longer works for my recording wise. I invested in a pro mic as my sound was quiet, I contacted the app who advised me to post the terrible video (low sound quality) in order to resolve.

I uninstalled and reinstalled the app and now the sound quality is low again with the same syncing issue. Unfortunately I will not be able to use the app 😕"

I have submitted almost 20 tickets and they have only got back to me for 2 or 3 with the scripted reply without a solution. Apart from this the app is ok coz most of your videos are not visible to your followers even if its creative and original with a good quality and light, where on the other hand some videos with worst quality and no proper lighting and improper lip sync get hundreds and thousands of likes, which I really don't understand how."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is amazing .however I did have come glitches happen while using the app. For example when you press the button to record a video with a sound .the sound played while the camera is just stock in a position .and no. On the camera app this has never happened. This glitch has been occurring for about 1 month and a half. Sometimes it works but not often. I herded ever record video anyway but i do however post edited . And it works just fine. So it doesn't really brother me that........ ali
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I go live a few times a week and I use the green screen filter like most people do during their live sessions. But as of last month mine are gone. I've reported the issue several times and nothing has been fixed. I have literally tried everything to remedy this issue and nothing has worked. I was hoping with this new update I would have seen the effects icon back where it should be but still nothing. I like using this feature and would like to be able to continue to have access to green screen.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"absolutely love the app just one small issue that I think would be super helpful to fix up in the new update maybe, would be the option to edit the caption/title of the videos we post so if a mistake is made there isnt the hastle of having to save the video and re upload it. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE consider this. It would be SUPER helpful in the long run of this app."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Love this app!!! But the one thing that is really sad and makes me feel frustrated/mad is that if you delete tiktok and re-install it all the drafts get deleted no matter how many you had and you can't get them back. Please do something about it like a new update or something where you can get your drafts back even after deleting the app.The drafts are sooo important to many and it's really upsetting when you lose them with the thought of not being able to get them back . Please and thank you
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's really good but there is something wrong with new creators.. They made videos with much struggle and got really opposite value about views.. Otherwise good.

I love the following tab so I can watch videos of people I follow but lately it disappeared.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is a great time waster, but ever since getting a new phone (Motorola Edge+ 2022) trying most effects (80% or so) just gives a message saying ""this effect doesn't work with this device"".

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I spend too much time on this app, and I've noticed that they removed the slideshow feature for some tiktok creators, myself included. It's very frustrating, especially since sometimes I just want to create a slideshow that other people swipe through. It's completely unfair, and then tiktok has a tendency to gatekeeper features from creators until they're 'popular' or 'trending'. The algorithm is great, but there's no incentive for me to create and share, which is a big part of Muhammad naseer"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy using the app however, I have come realisation that if you use the application for a long period of time, due to the stability of icons such as the ""home"" or ""create"" icon, even the ""For You"" writing, these stable icons overtime cause screen burning to occur. The screen burns are seen in both the blues and greens yet, they are more vivid in the blues. I hope you find a way to avoid further damages by a simple redesign of the application"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"How to lose a day. As good and funny as it can get, it's horribly time-consuming. It's very addictive and can be dangerous for the kids. After some time tiktok will start showing you videos of certain things, clothes, foods... just to make you buy them. It's horrible propaganda of certain things as well but of course you don't care because everyone have tik tok so you got to have it as well.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Edit: still no effects. Tried every tutorial, trick, everything. So disappointing. Just updated. Still no new voice effects. Do better tik tok. Updates and features are consistently EXTREMELY behind for Android. New features are often available months after iPhone users and the app itself is discriminatory toward Android, though most apps do. I am uses to this for most apps and for upload quality ect, I don't really care. I really just wish we got the new features when everyone else does."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love this app. It's very addicting. I just wish that they had all the same editing options for all the phones. Iphones have more exciting options than Androids and I think that's kinda messed up because not everyone can afford an iPhone that have this app. I'd love to use it more and be able to edit my videos and all that jazz more than I currently can.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app's size increases dramatically with time, it needs hell alot of internet connection, it glitches alot and sometimes it randomly freezes. Oh and, you can report a very obvious video that violates human rights for example, and they tell you ""we haven't found that this video violates anything"" it's frustrating!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"😘The best feature I like most tiktok is ""Use this/click template ;and l can easily videos"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Am i fr the only one still with the discover page, without profile views, or reposts like its so agravating cause tiktok sometimes will give me it but other times wont... like what the heck"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love the app, although it tends to be very buggy. Lately my fyp has been showing me same videos multiple times. Sometimes my comments or likes aren't visible to other users. The app misses many features such as easier access to the stitched or dueted videos on the original video, playlists, auto-scroll option, finding sounds by their lyrics, cc etc."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app, the algorithm gets really specific though so while that's a good thing cause you always get videos you like, it's difficult to get new types of videos so that can get a bit annoying at times. Other than that it's good, but maybe not the best if you don't have much space on your phone, for me it took around 4Gb so I had to delete it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why did they remove so much sounds???? Tiktok being sooo annoying frrr, Instagram is better by a long shot"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Bug that where I like videos they disappear and don't show up in my likes! I've like multiple tiktoks today and the last one listed is the last one I liked last night!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I just switched from iPhone to android and it's super buggy on Android. The pages freeze when I try to back out of private messages. Three pages bled together. The sound from a video, part of a live and part of private message were frozen on top of a video running in the background. 🥺 there's also no dark mode to select so it's bright, stark white, hurting my eyes."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Yeah it's fun and all, but I wish there was an option to explain your video is about when it's removed for ""guild line"" reasons. I have a video explaining how I was feeling bc I was stressed and mentally exhausted. It was taken down for ""violent actions and influencing violents."" When I went to appeal, there's no answer that's close to how i felt about the video. Also it keeps saying ""internet connection lost"" when my wifi is full bars. And then my phone over heats if I use it too long too."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Tiktok is crashing suddenly after the update.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's a great app. It's easy to use and it works great to get your point a crossed
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,this tiktok not updated solve this issue Tiktok is getting spiced up solve this quickly it would be nice of you please please please please solve it quickly
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love tiktok, don't get me wrong but I've been having this issue for a while now. Whenever I film a video, it lags at the beginning. Every. Single. Time. I thought ""Oh, maybe it was just a one time thing"" but as a I said, it's been happening for a while now. Now, if I were to lipsync to a sound, it lags behind. It's very annoying and there's nothing I can do about. There's no update avaliable, it's not just a filter I've been using, it happens every single video. Please fix this, tiktok."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The app is good all thik is good but add the call future audio call and video call Vote for call option🤝
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Please please fix the share button situation. I keep hitting ""don't show me this"" when really I want to hit ""favorite."" They're too close together and I'm losing content I really like without knowing how to get any of it back. --and Where do I go to change the settings for what I've accidentally hidden from myself? Can you make a list of things I put on the ""don't show me"" list in settings in the next update? That way I can remove it from that list and fix the mistake myself."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app itself is good, but there definitely needs to be an option to hide captions. It makes it nearly impossible to read things creators out at the bottom of the screen. I used to long press on the screen so a menu would pop up and I could read whatever is on the screen but now the menu comes from the bottom and is useless to me. It's so frustrating."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"For a brief period of time, I had a ""Clear Mode"" option and it was the greatest thing to happen to the app. The UI often hides creator text or obscures other details in the video, and while Clear Mode existed, it allowed a user to see the video without any of the UI elements. This made the app damn near perfect. However, for some reason, the developers took this function away?? Otherwise this would be a 4, maybe even 5 star app. Bring back clear mode, for the love of God"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Everything is great until I try and upload, edit, then post. I can't edit the footage once I get the music, cause it auto edits the lengths of the clips.if I try and make it without the sound and then add it, it cuts the total length of the video to only the time of the sound file I'm trying to use. I can't alter those clips once this happens, or put any after the sound file ends. Then, even after all that, the video is laggy in the stickers/texts/effects preview."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I feel like Tiktok should get a view just watched option where you are able to watch a video and go to that person's profile and have an option to find the video you've just watched and it's part 2 or so. Would make it so much more convenient than having to scroll through hundreds of videos. Thank you tiktok for adding the just watched button
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really good app! One thing that I'm not happy about is the audio sync with duets. I absolutely love the duet feature so u can add harmonies onto friends singing videos, but I have to work some type of magic to get the audio to sync up. I always make sure my phone is optimised before recording, but it doesn't sync up. Other times I have to uninstall/reinstall or even restart my phone to align the audio. Could there be a way to manually sync audio?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Look. I used to use Tiktok and I dumped it over a year ago when I realized I was so addicted that the side icons were permanently burned into my screen. I considered reinstalling it, but ads I've been getting for Tiktok lately are POV videos that trigger phobia based paranoia. Things I have spent many years in therapy for. If you guys ever had a chance of getting me to reinstall, you have THOROUGHLY lost it. If only ads from certain domains could be blocked."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Would be rated much higher if not for the fact that for some reason my app is like 100 updates behind? I don't have the story, repost, or tag feature, and the app itself just looks and runs like its outdated. The only way to fix this issue is to reinstall the app entirely, which is obviously enormously inconveniencing. However this doesn't make the app unusable and otherwise tiktok is great."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love the app all features work great. I still miss musically though
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Never takes me directly to the app if someone sends me a video in a different app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"For the most part I absolutely love the Tik Tok community I have discovered so many amazing people and videos. Though I get the purpose, the repetition of songs do get annoying and scrolling through 1-3 min videos isn't good for your brain. This app like many others can be addictive but in balance it's great and brings me a lot of beautiful emotions. 🦋"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very upset they took away my ability to edit my full clips with audio to sync up my videos. Now I have to edit my clips first then go to a separate section to pick my sound. Can't do both while in default mode. Can only do it with ""autosync"" which shortens all my clips with no means to extend them. Why would you take away such an important feature for audio/video editing within the app?! Please add great features or enhance them.. Now your like every other social app..disappointed 😔"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very good, very helpful keeps you updated , and very entertaining."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Since the last update my screen doesn't turn off anymore, not even when the video is paused and it draines battery like crazy. I often fall asleep watching tiktok but so far, if I manage to pause the video before sleeping the screen would turn off. The last few nights I woke up to an empty battery because it was still on. The screen should turn off when paused and after a video was played 5 times in a row. Anything else doesn't make sense..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've learned so much and been thoroughly entertained the entire time. Never disappoints.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app have all of your contacts and knows everything about you. I did not give it permission to my contents an files and yet it has full access to all of my contacts and files. I've checked and it still says that It don't have permission for my contents on settings. It also knows my friends from other media's that I don't have there numbers. 🙃
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Edited review:: I've used TikTok quite a bit, and while there ARE parts of tiktok that I dont like, or parts that may be problematic, the app itself is great for what it is. It's taught me things I never thought I'd know. It's helped with making me feel less isolated. - Disclaimer: Moderation is key. Learn how the algorithm works [its super easy] and you can tailor your experience near perfectly."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Everything is good but I really hate the new voice over. It's a lot less neutral than the other voice over. I would prefer a male voice or something than sounds less like the watch mojo voice. It's annoying because so many people use it so I have to see it often on my fyp. Also, I wish there was an option to skip forward a long video like tapping 3 times to the right would skip forward 10 seconds and to the left would go back."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The report system is broken, the community guidelines are way too strict for this to be considered a 13+ app, I cannot type tags without having to go back 10 times minimum, when I go to edit my text the text box will move to the corner of the screen making it inaccessible and unable to delete, and the layout makes navigating the app extremely difficult. There has been so many updates yet I never see these things get fixed. Just a really poorly managed app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I SWORE I would never download this app (ask anyone), yeah, ok, so now a week after downloading it, and if you look closely, you can see my nose prints on the screen. In short, I am addicted. Thank you"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"LOVE THE NEW EDIT CLIP FEATURE. But, after I upload a video every effect will freeze and the video will freeze out of order of the person talking. Delay and messing up my videos. The originals that's downloaded automatically to my phone pic album are fine. It's just my videos on the app. Real bummer to spend hours and have this as a result. I'm still getting likes so I dont know how the viewers are seeing this"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app, great for when your bored at home or work... Only problem i've had is trying to navigate your liked videos. There is alot and you can only see about 12, then you scroll, it loads and you see another 12... Hopefully they add some kind of user-made folder system to organise it (like photos or gallery does on your phone) it's gonna be annoying for everyone. Otherwise definitely recommend it!"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Loved it until they updated it with this garbage update. I preferred it the old way. I can't adjust the video after adding slo-mo without it removing the effect, which is why I NEED to adjust the video afterwards. It adds extra video where the music cuts off. Also, the app isn't letting me post right now after spending a VERY long time editing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This is a nice app in general, but for the 2nd time now this app doesn't want to open. The previous time it cost me uninstalling it to get it to work. I tried clearing the cached data and it's up to date on its updates. This shouldn't be happening! Please fix the problem. Then when it comes to removing videos and reviewing them for violations, you are taking down good people's videos but not videos where people use foul language and throw their child's father's ashes down a toilet. Explain how?"

I'm left handed and I constantly accidentally refresh my tik tok almost every video, if you change the the refresh button to the (For you) spot right next to (Following) it would be way more efficient in my mind. I'm honestly not sure if anyone else has this issue but it bothers me to the point where I actually wanted to comment. This wouldn't change barely anything other then where the refresh button is.

Scroll past the ad and it crashes AGAIN. It took me around 15 tries to get the app to stay open long enough to even clear the cache which did nothing. As soon as the app opens the ad plays AGAIN with NO PROBLEM but trying to see ANY posted Toks the video freezes and it resets.

There can be gore, wounds, very disturbing photos of demons etc. The new slides update is horrid. I believe you should have a filter that filters out bad content and throws it out. Or delete it entirely. It is truly bad and people are getting trust issues. I don't have a problem."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have had this app from musically, but recently it's been telling me that there is no connection. Or to retry and load the screen. I have full bars. I tried re opening the app as well as downloading again. Nothing works, there must be a bug or a glitch. This has been happening for about 2 days and I'm getting tired of redownloading the app. Please do something about this."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is great, I put a low rating because the algorithm is hard to understand and even if I have over 1400 followers, I only get 3-4 views each video. I would like if I could get my videos around without paying for more views."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,One of most useless services on the earth I have been trying to log in my account but they can recognize my device I have contacted customer support but it's about 1 month but no response I will not recommend to create account and spent time on it 😠😠
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. Started as a joke back in 2021, but now I can't stay off of it. Love watching and making videos. The things I have learned and the laughs and tears I've had from following the creators on this app is a source of joy that can never be measured."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is so dumb. The one and only video i posted got taken down for one reason or another, who really knows why. If i can't post what i want on my page, I'll gladly delete my account and tell everyone i know to do the same.. also i tried to delete my account and the app wouldn't let me so... (That's not creepy at all)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's such a great place to get lost in for hours. Whether it's just watching funny videos or checking people out on live and chatting with them. A lot of people live stream gaming. It's awesome to watch!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tried it out. Watched one video, was pretty funny. Tried to like it to support the content creator. Prompted to create an account. Typed my number in, autocorrect automatically added the +1 again, and I absentmindedly pressed confirm. Assuming it wouldn't send, I went back and attempted to retype it. I was prompted ""You're sending too many verification codes, try again later."" I wasn't aware that one classified as many, or for that matter plural at all. Won't be ""trying again later."""

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Tik too is amazing but the reason I gave it four stars is because When I open the app the videos don,t want to play but I have data and sometimes it just turns black and changes its self it annoys me but otherwise it's a great app"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I give it 4* because when i send a msg and then delete it the recipient can still see it. Maybe makers can add an unsend option in which we can permanently delete the message from our side and from other side ...
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app work fine overall and Tiktok as a service has its pros and cons. I think the app performs quite poorly when it comes to notifications. Ideally, all the guff and unnecessary popups get turned off, but when it's left to just having likes and comments appear in the inbox, they seem not to show up half of the time. Sometimes views don't appear on videos unless the app gets force closed, and the app drains battery after being closed unless force closed. Rather big issues."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app doesn't have the search bar for effects when you want to do a video and no save bar too

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The biggest problem I'm having right now is that I try to send friends videos (thru app) and their names don't pop-up. I try searching and they literally don't show up as an option. It happened once already and took like 3 days before randomly stopping and working again. Not sure if anyone is having this issue, but it's fairly inconvenient when it does."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I keep hitting the Not Interested button. But the app brings the same video/creator up again no matter how many times I select the option for it not to.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a really nice app, but sometimes when I scroll the videos freeze a bit and it annoys me, also when I repost, I'm the person who reposts a lot so my reposts sometimes unrepost itself, those are my only issues and tiktok it too soft, like why can someone swear at me in the comments but I cannot swear at them? This is unfair."

I had previously uninstalled tiktok because it was causing my whole phone to glitch. Friends assured me the bugs have been fixed, so I installed it again. Now, it takes over my Bluetooth. It disconnects my Bluetooth from my audible app right in the middle of a book in listening to. Not cool! If I have to pick, I pick my audible. See ya."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app is nothing but ads or people trying to make commission. It's taking the fun out of the app. I also wish there was an easier way to block spam accounts.

First if freezes on me then the loading bar at the bottom starts to flashing white, which I have come to know it's about to freeze and uninstall the app. It does this about 20 times a week. I have installed and done a complete uninstall just to have the same issues. I have come to understand that if people do this enough I could see where it's the #1 rated downloaded app. Not because it's the best."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So while this app has been letting me post content and with every page has a certain topic they would post under. And recently I've had both my meme/junk accounts banned due to unclear violations of the community guidelines, I still do not understand what I did, however of you're just a small content creator, and you post what you love, I do not recommend this app if you're trying just to have fun and share what you love doing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's kind of an upfront world neted social interaction meeting every one's need to express their status of feeling, activity, concerns and what note ..... within terms and conditions of use. I like the app sincerely."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ever since this recent update. The app has not been running properly. I have to hit the bookmark icon multiple times in order to get it to bookmark and when it does I scroll to the next clip it then says it marked it. When trying to share, the people I normally share too are gone and all I see is an empty space and under that are to share to different apps. Someone broke something. I have restarted my phone, uninstalled and re-installed the app, and clear all the data from phone n no good."

I have tried all of the suggestions provided to fix it - cleared caches, turned off and on device, even uninstalled and reinstalled. Nothing is working. I am able to stream and watch other things ok so I am pretty positive it's not the internet. Otherwise, I like the app perfectly fine."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I used to love this app for how much I have learned on it and how enjoyable the trends were. But lately the app has become worst than fb insta and X in the censorship. New stories I.shated on the app ate banned here and are allowed on FB, insta and X. My content gets less views than it used to which makes being on this app pointless."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok is a very good app that you can use to share your ideas and experience with others in a few minutes, most of what you can share in tiktok is videos, you can also use the app and makes money 💷"

I won't be spending my money in TT. I kinda getting over this app. I opened an account in discord. Screw it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It has been an amazing experience learning so much new stuff. I talk about controversial stuff and I don't seem to get shadow banned. My videos have gotten OK views. I have gotten seven community guideline violations all from posting stuff I found on tiktok. I'm concerned about social media platforms and the weaponization of the Intelligence community to spy on and censor. Privacy and freedom of speech are essential to a democracy.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Normally I love this app. But for some reason it's been super glitchy all day today. I'm not sure if it's a new update or what. At first I thought it was just my phone, but turning it off and then back on again didn't fix anything. When I try to open the TikTok app it either won't open at all or it will open and randomly switch videos on me when I am not even touching my phone. I can only watch the first like 5 seconds of a video and then all of a sudden a completely different video will start."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app is bias for African bodies. They will restrict your lives streaming because you have a great African figure then no viewers and no support. Just a waste of time. We don't makeup our clothes or bodies. Fu(k everybody that works at TikTok!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,For the most part I like this app. But for some reason videos will download themselves and I'll just find them randomly in my photo and video folders. Like I know I didn't save them or download them personally but somehow they are automatically getting saved to my phone. Also I wish there was a way to look at stitches and duets for a video I like instead of scrolling forever through the audio.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have a suggestion,Since we save so many things in favorites add something or like videos 100-200 that we can just go to the videos we saved instead of scrolling all the way back.I have over 3000 vids saved so please."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The thing I blame for the existance of Shorts as a standard thing(vids averaging15s). Im a straight man and dont need all these 'Socials'. Apparently Vine started it but then died. But TikTok both brought me animal egirls 'Whoohoo!' And cemented Shorts as a popular format 'D'oh!. I was happily enjoying YT and then this nonsense invaded my surch results. FO! Whats worse than the tiktok 'trends' XtrEm lack of originality is the same Soundbite is used over and over. Worse than pop: Earworms!

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Um can we please have the search back in our following section? Like I don't want to scroll to find the people you decided to ban without removing them from my list. Also would appreciate it if I could have sound back in my videos.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a good app for its entertaining purposes, but it needs some extra features. For example to be able to edit comments, to be able to message someone if they dont follow you back. And something more important: looking for a specific video in someone else's profile is a PAIN. Maybe searching by keywords would help, or adding something like categories. Just a suggestion, but overall the app effectively kills boredom."

I just wish Stitch's were maybe a little longer like 10 second's and l have a gripe with the 10 minute option.

It's actually ridiculous how this app has so much hate on it but literally has a report button for every minor thing. It's like it's there just for show."

It's not bad if you don't make it a habit, but like most social media, it can keep you scrolling for endless hours & spread dangerous trends (like deadly). I've uninstalled it after having it for 3 years since I've found that it has no greater purpose to my life. I've found great content creators, as well as cringe ones, but I've also found that I felt like trash after scrolling for too long. In order to make something of my life, I've decided not to waste it."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,They have started blocking your organic reach so that you'll have to pay for views on your videos even if you have thousands of followers they still won't let you get over a 100- 300 views on most of your content. This also means that if you follow someone you're not likely to see a lot of their content because they would be blocking the reach of that Creator as well.

Shame on you tiktok. Do better."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall, good. They do remove posts unnecessarily a lot! Posts also should be able to be edited for the first couple of minutes if there are errors."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Actually good but when you have a android when you're scrolling it's makes you join random lives and you can't send videos to your friends and you can't make a slide thing
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I downloaded this app to use for video editing with the synced music but it won't let me use certain songs and just says ""syncing sound.."" but won't let me do anything so I have to restart the app and lose my video progress. It cuts out audio in the last quarter of my videos after posting it and won't fix itself. Starts freezing the videos in certain parts so I have to restart the whole editing process again. Please fix the video editing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's good but some video when you upload it sometimes they cleared the sound

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like this app as it's fun and entertaining but it's not really fun to see my videos flop, so when I try to promote it the option isn't even there. I know me flopping has nothing to do with tiktok but please add the button back, also please fix your slideshows. when I use it it's very bad quality or when I add just a picture in general, please fix it!!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App used to be enjoyable, but recently there has been a huge increase in spam accounts. The ""not interested"" button doesn't seem to function at all. And there is zero way to block a tiktok Audio or specific filters so instead of seeing actual videos my entire feed is the exact same videos on Loop all posted by different accounts. No matter how much I interact with videos I actually want to see my whole feed is flooded with the exact same song. I have to block hundreds of accounts because this"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Really enjoy being able to check everything out and follow people with similar interests but the moderation of the platform is ridiculous.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I hate when it won't let me do a slide show and wont let me text anymore I true texting my sister but it won't this is a trash app ban it and it won't let me update it anymore it's trash ease ban it
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Can't open the app! It is keep get me out everytime I click the icone!!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Was a 4 star, but with the limited editing options now for videos (at least on my devices) I can no longer clip, delete, or speed up or slow down videos like I used to at certain points. I've checked options everywhere, but for me they're gone. The old editing options were better and more detailed. Now you pretty much have to use capcut app to do that instead of just using TikTok itself."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Won't be getting a higher rating until the notifications stop. *someone you've never heard of has posted a new video* *someone you've never heard of has invited you to watch their live* I can't mute app notifications individually on my phone, so I have to uninstall every night to ensure a good sleep. When I'm using the app though, everything works perfectly."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really like tiktok. There's so much content variety, you're seeing what the world wants to share, if you think it's fake you can look it up on your own to be sure. Also it's every emotion you could want, some sad, inspirational, hilarity, news, cool things. The only thing it's missing is back and forth audio/video interaction. Like the -Live broadcasts are cool, but the person doing it can't really do anything except try to read what people are typing, so for now it gets 4 stars."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've had Tiktok for over a year now and I love it! The only problem is recently I've been having problems with the videos. The audio will play just fine but the video itself will lag and freeze, like the sound isn't synced with the video. I've tried several things to try to fix it but nothing has helped. Other than that, it would be 5 stars."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I have a report when I try to use the outline filter Everytime I touch it it makes the whole screen go white instead of letting me draw what I want fix it and it's not my screen because there's no cracks on my screen and there's nothing wrong with my device
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ever since the app updated its been a mess. Constantly glitches and says it's not connected to the network (forgot the actual verbiage it uses when it says it's not connected). THE worst part is when I share a tiktok with someone, I have to scroll back and forth between tiktoks to make the share menu go away and the share menu freezes in place making it frustrating and impossible to share videos with people. I've put in two help desk tickets and have had zero resolution and it's been weeks."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I love everything about this app and I would have rate you 5 star but the problem I have is that I can't send message or receive message from my followers you need to fix that as soon as possible
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I click on the tiktok app and it let's me in for like 5 seconds, then it just takes me back to were the app is on my phone"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I finding it a very entertaining platform I can't put my phone down during the day. I look forward to seeing my favorite creator's. I also ordered from the tiktok store not only did my product arrive early but it very good quality. Thank you Tiktok for being the best platform over Facebook. 😁
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I loved it! But the only thing that's throwing me off is the fact that I can't repost or see reposts, but other friends can see mine. I tried unistalling and installing again(twice), but it's just not working. Can someone please explain why or what can I do? Am I supposed to make a new account?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"0 stars. The technical functioning of this app is HORRIBLE. It takes up like 30% of my phone storage. Constantly deletes my in-progress videos. Bans random videos but allows child abuse, racism, ableism, bullying. Forces me to watch random lives I never clicked and freezes on them. Puts your comments under the wrong post, sends your friends random videos. Makes your entire phone crash constantly. Refuses to let you uninstall the app. Thanks for making something enjoyable into a nightmare."
