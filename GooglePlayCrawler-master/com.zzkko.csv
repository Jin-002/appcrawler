Saved 3 items to basket and thought I'll continue shopping, picked a few more items. I go back to my basket, my first lot are gone and standard delivery costs applied. After scrolling and scrolling I'm not going to repeat this process, sorry but lost this customer before you started with a poor e-commerce platform. They have tried to gamify the process, free crystals, games to pick a card but it's a con"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love this app. The clothes are great, and they're true to there size listed, and they fit very well. They have beautiful vibrant colors, soft materials, and a very big selection to choose from depending on what you're looking for, you'll find it on here; Formal, summer, beach/pool, Play Clothes, Short Sets, Summer Dresses, Pant Suits, Capri Sets, Church Dresses & Etc. a huge variety to choose from. Check Out this Great Clothes Shopping App. You Will Fall In Love With It Too!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app has a daily check-in where you can collect and earn points to redeem on purchases. I don't know when the update happened, but I've noticed that my points have been lowering instead of rising. They added a thing where the points expire and it is ridiculous! I do not order often, but I do order! I wish it would go back to how it was before!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I originally had them at 5 starts but heaven help you if you have any issues because trying to contact support is all but impossible and when you finally do get in contact with them they wait until they're 'unable' to help you because your item has been shipped. Very disappointed as I shop with them all the time. I got a very beautiful and fantastic dress for a really affordable price. Like I've bought jeans for more.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Becareful shopping with them. I've been screaming for 2 days. I placed an order worth $256, and almost half my items are missing. I contacted customer support via the app, and they're telling me they can't process my request because, according to their verification at the ""warehouse,"" everything was in the package😭😭one of the items missing was supposed to be my graduation outfit for April 1st but Shein is ignoring my emails and tweets regarding my missing items 😢 this is so heartbreaking 😭💔"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I give three stars because no different then wish or temu it's decent quality things for a lower price. Now that's good and all I've had no problems except with sheins obvious add costs savings by implementing games to win online credit which counts towards purchases but these games are rigged for example one displays the drawings to be two sets of 10 a few 5s and a couple threes after two shares you have to invite friends to earn more but now 0.01 what should I expect from a Chinese ran app tho
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I enjoy the puppy game. It seems like a more mature version of temu. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the lingerie. It's absolutely gorgeous and the prices are to die for! You won't get deals like this anywhere else! Plus the chance to win free stuff if you put the time in. You don't have to even spend a penny to get stuff from them!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Thank you for restoring the old tile format back. Shopping is always fun on shein. They have so many styles and really great price points! I've placed probably close to 20 orders now, and never had an issue. Returns are easy, and they go back to your account as shein credits to use for your next purchase. Shipping is fast and i always receive my shipments within 2 weeks. I've gotten all my friends hooked on shein too!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Honestly trying not to order from here as much and switching to temu cause they lie about the prices. I'll have items in my cart and once I go to check out, each item goes up at least $5. My total before is way cheaper than my total once I hit check out, and that's even WITH THE COUPINS ADDED. Like $20+ more, not including the shipping. Like how is my total that much more than what my total in my cart said it was just by clicking checkout, and even after coupons are applied it's still more???"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Magic Draw Game is a CHEAT!!! I used to love Shein and I thought the Magic Draw game was a great promotion however it's a lie and a cheat. I did all the necessary steps to earn the credit towards clothes. the cards say one amount but Shein changes them once they flip over so that you can't reach the goal. It's a whole cheating scam. Totally disappointed and I will be telling all the people I referred as well. Honesty is big with me so the game being deceitful was it for me. Would NOT recommend!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,You get NO STARS from me. So I have just found out that this app just took money out of my acct without an order. I never save my bank information on any app and I always use PayPal for protection (which was not supposed to be on file either)so needless to say I'm in dispute with Shein from taking over $125 from my PayPal account that I did not authorize to keep on file😡 and there's no order placed on the app to justify the payment
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Items are pretty good, true to size. However, the recent courier choice for Dubai is a let down. Lazy... Don't want to travel where I live. So I find an alternate address. Aggressive... Shout at me frustration because they can't listen. Arrogant... Traveling without GPS locations and telling me where I went wrong when my instructions are clear to other delivery companies and they never had a problem."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm really disappointed and angry..why you're showing low prices on display when you actually change prices when it's in the cart ..more than one product I've chosen was on low price they become full priced after moving them to the cart.. and coupon wasn't applied after buying the items, you're should be more professional and honest with your deals... keep the same amount in display and cart,be honest"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"What an awful, covoluted interface. This was somehow designed by an absolute idiot. It is entirely too difficult to navigate. The dpin wheels and rewarss are a pathetic attempt at psychological manipulation. The prices change when you add items to your cart. They make it impossible to delete your account. Useless. Just don't bother."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Not only does this fast-fashion app involve child labour that pays poor wages for extended amount of shifts, it also takes 7-8 days for the shipping to actually arrive, products will be one-time use or badly designed clothes that undo after 5 months max. Alongside all this baffling execution, they have added in MULTIPLE SCAMS, which gives false hope that you will win extra money and spend it for free. Overall waste of time and money. Any good review is definitely a robot!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app was a great app, until I bought something a couple months ago. I've bought things in the past from shein, so I was just expecting a normal arrival. But since I've ordered it in November--(it's currently March), I haven't received it. I thought the package may have gotten lost because it said it was on transit, but then the same thing happened in January, and I still haven't gotten that package either. Im not able to get a refund because it's been so long. I want my 30$ back."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I returned 2 items, arrived to them at same time, and 1 was refunded. They claim i sent back a 'non-Shein' item in other bag. The app still shows status of unpacking 2 wks later. They are refusing to refund me and want to ship me my non-shein item back at a cost to me. They refuse to provide any kind of phone # to talk to someone and the ticket/chat process makes no sense. Never shopping here again. Refuse to refund me and want to charge me to ship whatever they claim I sent them back to me."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Whoever nade changes to the app needs to be fired. Not seeing images at a glance of reviews is a crime. It makes me not want to buy things because it's more work to look and see the reviews and have to hunt for images sometimes. And then seeing more suggestions every time you add something to your wishlist- you can see suggestions below already. Why do you need a pop-up for it? The app also feels more crowded because the size of everything is smaller. Please don't fix what isn't broke.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I actually like shein, but.... and it's a BIG BUT, why is your order section so annoying. I usually order large amounts of clothing, but whenever I go to look for the total cost of my, for example, last order, I get a list of each item with their individual prices. It ok that I can see a breakdown, but can I get a receipt with the total cost first, then point me to the link that shows me the itemized list of each product?! It's annoying to have to sit w/ a calculator everytime."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Items are hit or miss, great deals or absolute garbage, but this is simply a pool of manufacturers. My issue is SHEIN's practices, namely shipping. This is where their profit lies. Shipping from China is almost free under $800 per parcel. They charge you $4-13. Spend $30, get it free, no problem, but then you can't use your points or credits otherwise they charge regardless of order size. Problem with coupons as well. You're told they're applied until you see your total on the last page. Scummy"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Not a bad app to use if your looking for cheap stuff. i have had some problems with items not matching pictures or descriptions given and one was sent to me broken and I can't return or exchange it. What ever you do don't fall for the free gift gimmick its just a way to get you to invite people you can send it to everyone in your contacts and it still says send to one more they never actually get to the end were they send the stuff to you. But all in all a good place to shop.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After placing several orders on their website, I ended up receiving a different item and it was something I really needed (winter coat). I raised the issue with their Customer Service and they said they will open a ""free"" return for the wrong item, but apparently I still have to search for a courier and return it by myself and pay an extra 20 euros for the shipping, for a mistake Shein made. And then wait for a couple of weeks until they get the item and check it and maybe refund me...Horrible!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Used to shop on Shein very often, but there have been some changes lately. A big part of the appeal were the discount coupons, but they capped the discount at €12. When placing a large order, I'm now missing out on a €50 discount that I would normally get. Also, on item pages, it now shows ""estimated price"", which is lower than the actual price when I go to check out, so it's also misleading. Because of this it is no longer cheaper than other sites, so I won't be ordering as often anymore."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Its really annoying how every minute the prizes are changing. also I receive like 10 emails a day and my phone is bombed with notifications!! With all these disturbing features I dont feel like buying anything. What I noticed about the products is that they often look different, bigger or so on the pictures. But in reality they are different. Sometimes infos are given in the title/discription."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been having an issue where I get an error message when I try to add anything to my wishlist for over a month now. I've tried support multiple times, starting the first day of the issue. Every support agent, has ignored the issue and closed out the ticket. Until last night. Last night I'm told that it's because of either multiple accounts (I only have 1) or low credit score. Why is shein running a credit check on me? And how did they get that info to do so? This is concerning."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The only thing i don't get is why certain items like for example make up don't get shipped to Malta and to other countries like italy yes. Can't you arrange it so it can be shipped to Malta too!?? I mean it's not the first time i've ordered from another app like ali express or joom with no problems and with free shipping as well at least you should sent them especially when you have to spent certain amount for free shipping it's not fair. I bet if you arrange it a lot of people will buy more
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I made a purchase and it said something about having to verify. They wanted screenshots of my transactions then it was stuck in the verifying process forever. I got the process for my refund quicker than getting them to verify my purchase. Makes no sense to purchase from them if it's going to take forever. On top of you don't even know if you will get the shipment
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I made an order which I received with one part of item missed..I contacted customer support, after all evidences which I sent they didn't confirm that were an item missed It is very frustrating to lose a lot of time not only for the price of the item, but also to prove your point, and there is no fair result. From my experience, customer service and follow-up are not as they should be."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"App works perfectly fine given that you have a secured internet connection, it's very easy to use and it's very safe and secure for online payments and I haven't encountered any problems since using it, it's actually the best online shopping app I've used so far, it has almost everything I want and you get updated with everything including ways of earning points, with your order if you've placed one, with sales and newly dropped items."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Updated Review : My only concern at this time is the app's performance. It keeps on lagging and unresponsive after a few minutes. There is also no option to refresh the app so I had to close it entirely then re-open it, which is quite a hassle."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love it. I'm a Gothic woman, and it can be hard to find affordable Gothic clothing that won't fall apart. Shein is the place I have been looking for years. They also have beautiful home decor and useful gadgets. I get so many compliments on the outfits I put together I recommend shein to everyone I know. I have been shopping for a few months now and quickly replacing my wardrobe with wonderful pieces I bought on shein. So great full to look good on a budget."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have been scammed 2 times! One was with a lip tint which is ok it was cheap but then another time was one that I needed like now! And it could not even come! I might delete the app even though l have gotten some good stuff from them! This is just Dissapointing!!!!! I want my stuff! I paid my money and never got a refund at all! I'm super disappointed and I expected better then this
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's the worst app i have ever used. Cannot be trusted. Recently made a purchase and returned a few items and received an incorrect refund for the I have spent over a month trying to explain & get a correct refund. I opened an enquiry, and they closed it without even resolving it than i had to open another enquiry and repeat myself over & over again. If it was $1 i would have let it go but they owe me around $63. Most untrusted."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"love the app, but for some reason they delayed a few items off for processing. I bought 2 items from shein on January 4 because I was in a hurry to get both items since it was selling FAST! I had to get them too because it cost less. I was suprised how it's still stuck on processing for a day, when they regularly ship it immediately. I even asked the live customer service regarding my issue but no changes. I checked the items now to see if I can repurchase. Both are sold out!!! I FEEL CHEATED!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"SheIn used to be my favorite shopping app. Now I buy less and less from it because the items have become more expensive, and every time there's a new rule that makes us pay more money! For example, most items I choose are not eligible for coupons (discounts) & they're not cheap! Other items can not be returned. Basically, everything that made SheIn so popular is no longer applicable! Quite disappointed at the changes, to be honest."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Some suggestions to have a better app experience. 1. Improve review page. I always have had an infuriatingly time trying to review stuff because it resets back to being blank. You can't switch tabs, can't leave phone to screen time out, if you do, it all resets. Have it possible to review one item at time. Because if you review five items and the whole page resets that's really annoying"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't like your app in terms of shopping anymore. I can't use all the coins I earned for orders. That is why I have no motivation to check in every day. The vouchers can use only to selected items. It's very red flag. Before, I always brag to my friends that this app is good in terms of saving save money but want to have a high quality products and design. However, right now, I do not recommend it anymore to them. Very pricey and not friendly anymore."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is the worst online shopping app I've ever used. Aside from it always timing out, it just hangs, and every time you open it, you have to redo it like 3 times before you can fully see the pics. After a minute browsing, the app will just lag and will pop up an error ""time out"" Tha shopping experience is very frustrating. Whoever the developer of this app is, is noy updating the app, or probably have never used the app itself. 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Quality is dire, used to be good but has went down hill massively, customer service is just bots and predetermined questions, no human interaction to prevent complaints. Out of the 6 items I ordered last 3 came in tact as advertised, 1 was different to the advertised style, 1 item was broken and the most expensive item an android phone game controller arrived faulty, il stick with Temu from now on, same prices, way higher quality, but most importantly easy to interact and solve porblems with!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I'm not happy with this BS. I bought 6 things and at first I really liked the app. it has a lot of variety BUT of course a day after I submit my purchase it refunds one of my most expensive items that were in my cart and I didn't do that! and if that wasn't enough it takes 7-8 business days to arrive at your door or for pickup AND another 4-7 business days to get your refund to go through and get your money back. plus I no longer have free shipping which I'm not happy about. you best fix this
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Having serious issues with packages saying delivered and not being in the mailbox. I thought maybe someone stole them but when I looked on X I see it's happening to a lot of people in the states and other countries. I would fix this because it looks like you are trying to steal money from people. Thankfully I got a refund. I'm disappointed because I have been a customer for over a year and will take a break on buying anything else until I know this issue is fixed.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Shein used to be a really good app but now i have big issues with this app 1.points-they used to give alot of daily check in points but now they have lowered the points it used to be 20 but now they have lowered it to 1 or 3 a day 2.shipping fee- they have took free shipping away now and made the shipping fee £3. 3.they have also took the 5p credit away 4.u cant use all ur point when checking out which is very annoying People used shein cuz of points an credit i doubt anyone wants to use shein!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very good and upto date of all different kinds of items ie furniture, clothes, shoes, fashion, homeware, accessories ect, very cheap and comes as it looks in the picture though household items can vary in size or alot bigger than expected to be but I still say good quality and good value, I get addicted and carried away when strolling through the app, they have absolutely everything 🤑🤯🤔😦🤫🥰"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's very convenient to shop, the prices are good, very affordable and it depends/base on what fabric they use. I love those classy style in a cheaper and affordable prices. But, minus one star because I have one and only concern and it's about the points. I can't open it, and I can't check in and earn points everyday. But, all in all it's fine and amazing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So disappointed, the price changes when adding items to the cart, points are supposed to reduce the price but when applied it reduce the price and add shipping fees . Free shipping was from spending £10 or 25 max to 35 quids now Not using the app anymore would ratehr go to shops at least I know the quality of what i am getting The company should look again at their new service and try to make kt better"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I love shopping on here however I'm not liking this latest update I hate how the tiles have been redesigned. It was completely unnecessary the design of the app was not needed the point system was the only thing that needed to be fixed. It shouldn't take me half a year to get 10 dollars in points. Points should not be deducted unless a person has stopped checking in or missed a day. But if your checking in daily points should not be taken away.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I've been having problems for the last couple months in regards to purchasing. I've sent in tickets and they keep closing them without giving me a response. I then spoke with someone virtually and asked them the question again and they said that they was abnormal activities on my account. I then asked what they were and they closed my ticket AGAIN. I'm not happy about this at all as I used to love shopping on Shein. It's rude to ignore customers
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I can't make any purchase whatsoever on my account but i can do so on someone else's account. They say it's my card but upon checking with my bank everything is fine on my end but some how it's still not making any purchase. And their customer service is very poor. They can't fix the problem. And to to top it off i can't even delete my account. If only I could give zero stars, am sure this site would get it."

Should had halt order once an order had a modify request. I can't cancel order due stock availability, discounted prices and expiring coupons else I wouldn't do CS exchange"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app has good clothing but I want to be able to choose the colour of clothing I'm choosing when I'm putting stuff in a board from my wishlist and I want to be able to pick more than one category type so I can put them all in at once
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Update : can't contact them. They are useless and very unhelpful and rude. Can't get the games to open. Says suspicious activity due to multiple accounts. Only have one phone and one account. No other devices to put the Shein app on. Such a hoax and scam.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It would be nice that you can be able to delete items out of your wish list. Some items are appearing in your wish list which I did not select.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My daughter has recently purchased some items including outfits for an event via Shein. Probably our 10th order to date. Paid as usual via debit card & Shein asked us to send proof of successful transaction. WARNING a debit or credit card can't send proof other than bank statement. Only EFT has a pop. We placed the order a 2nd time thinking its her card. Shein cancelled both orders despite screenshots of the bank App. She is now 11k out of pocket awaiting refunds. Beware how much you spend!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The app is easy to use and smooth flowing. The colors pop right at you and I know that I want everything they have to offer!!! The prices are fantastic so I can afford a lot.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I love the app, I truly do, and I will continue to use it, it's just the damn in-game parts of the app are hella rigged. I have to constantly send friends links or else, and the damn things always is cut in half? Like damn, I could send it to possibly 10 people and still not be allegitable for the ""free"" stuff, all because I have like 5 cents left. It's just a hassle to even do this within the time limit as well, I'm not free for 24 hours to send links to the only people I know. I hate it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Update: Still no feedback from Shein nor Buffalo. Seems like I have to wait it out and receive or not receive my package. Myself and my wife ordered at the same time 3 weeks ago, she had constant feedback on the app as well as the courier company Buffalo. She received her order in the week, still waiting for my delivery. Logged a call with Buffalo with no answer. Won't be using shein again."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I went onto the app to turn off push notifications. Instead of being able to just turn them off, the coding took me to some legal jargon pertaining to rights on third party cookies, and suggested I go to the bottom of their webpage to see Cookie Settings to turn them off, which was nearly impossible unless you're quick thanks to the infinity scroll. It led me to more legal jargon saying they don't actually have any rights to the third party push notifications. Oh well. Deleting."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Surprisingly good experience as a shopper in Africa. Apart from peak season, parcels arrive within 2 weeks of order which is really fast. They use good local couriers with solid tracking systems and the customs charges are usually not that bad unless a very big parcel. Every item I've ordered so far has matched the images on the site. Sizing has mostly been quite true to size, take care with ladies items as they often run a bit smaller. Have bought clothes and household items, all pretty good!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"No way to contact customer service. I have several items never delivered and the app does not help you get in contact with anyone to resolve the problem.

As far as the money I've contacted shein and Klarna nothing hasn't been done. I just hope affirm doesn't do this as well smh!

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,They said if i purchased at least 1 item then i would get 5 (cheap) free gifts and i bought 2 things and they wouldn't give me the gifts. Temu will if it said to purchase something to get the gift. I've got 3 of them now. So i invited people and they accepted it and it still won't let me get anything free. They lie when they say you get a free gift. I tried to cancel my order but it won't go through. I tried to delete my account but i have to apply? Whole thing is stupid
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I have been using this app for a while now and I love it. But I just started playing puppy keep and when I try to send an invite to my friends to get more food it doesn't even send it they never get my invite please please fix this.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Man Id give this shopping app 5 stars if they included Koror Palau in their international country list. App is convenient to use, products are good quality and you can't beat the price, but I constantly have to ship elsewhere and have it forwarded to me. Can you add Palau (PW) to your list of countries so we can have it shipped directly to us?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Totally shambolic APP. It takes ages to even register an account. It keeps saying system busy ... updating! But after a while when you try to register again, it will say system won't let you register too many aacount. Wasted my whole evening to find my items only to find out yiu cannot register and place your order. Same thing with their website! Waste of time!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They changed the return policies. It's now too complicated and annoying to return a product specifically for people living out of China. Most of products are not returnable anymore and if by any mistake you choose them, after two/three weeks of waiting you will receive a useless product that you cannot do anything with it! After three years of being a consistent customer of Shein I decided to stop ordering from Shein only because of very inconvenient return process."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The prices are great. I've never had a problem with ordering anything from them but it seem when you order large items, it takes way longer than the estimated delivery time. I ordered something on the 16th of Feb. It is now the 1st of March and it's still waiting to be shipped. Customer service doesn't help and it just keeps telling me the same thing over and over."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really like this app, But it does have it's downsides. When I try and place an order or even just going on the app period, it always says my server is down. Also I try to use coupons on my orders but the app won't allow me to use my other coupons. I love shopping on this app and it's quite addictive in the first few days of having it, but the app owners need to work on some things. Overall, I really enjoy shein and I recommend it to other people."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I wasn't a fan of a lot of websites that sold things like discounted clothing sites, and the ones for plus sized were usually some things your own mother wouldn't want to wear. Shein, I love that you have these clothes that allow me to express my appreciation of all the silly things I love, like an adorable dinosaur 🦕 print overall jumpsuit. I love it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"weird pricing. i don't like that it says ""estimated price"" just show me the real price & subtotal. i had an estimated price of $20 and the real price was $30 which isn't a lot but very misleading. also the prices for items change constantly which is annoying."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,the free gift things like puppy keep is so laggy and just kicks you out of it every minute. the shipping costs to much i was going to get a ring for a dollar but had to pay 5 dollars in shipping and a dollar in taxs. it was way to much just for that. i hope they can fix their app and make it better for everyone.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Charged 47£ for a 38£ order. The customer service is a waste of time.

I dont know why as i didn have any electric items or i didn order a lot.. the one parcel came missing one item and the second im still waiting for i contacted shein and they recon its delivered but on their website the parcel is still showing not even on the plane or boat... i quizzed them and no reply never order again
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My problem is when you order more than Euro180 you are going to pay shipping fee I hate that I have to order in two different ways to get free shipping I just don't like that way . Other app like AliExpress are not like that so annoying 😠😠😠 I can't even give you guys more than one start
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I dont like the new update regarding the points. Now, it takes so much time to collect points, like everyday i can only get 3 points. Please bring back the point system before the update. The points were the ones that brought me to this app. I was a day closer to higher points to claim, but it moved to 3 days farther. Not the shein i used to like."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Shein is a scam. The app is very unreliable with orders. I submitted my return November 2023, January 2024 they closed my return application on the app without any refund. The app just notified me that my clothes were now showing as delivered in February 2024 yet I received and returned them November 2023. Shein is very incompetent as their numbers and emails do not even go through, what a waste! My money wasted for nothing!"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I placed an order, the pants were heavier than they looked in the picture, and were to short. I will never wear them. They cost 13 dollars and some change. First time buyer. When I went to return them , I was told it would cost me 7.99 to ship them back. I did try to discuss it with the bot, but it's not very intelligent. I deleted the app and will never buy from them again."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I luv this app po since all the outfits that I've purchased is pretty i mean not scam or something hshshs and also this app is not laggy for me. I just don't know why it's laggy for some ppl. Like, my phone is not really good af and it has a low specs. Yet, i never encountered crashing or lagging on this app HAHAHAHA lucky me. So uhm yeah 5 stars! ><"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Don't trust to ""people"" feedbacks, shein delete negative reviews! Moreover, they post fake item pictures, they deliver wrong items, or don't deliver them at all. If some item is missing in your parcel, they never reimburse the price! Waste of money"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app includes a daily check-in where you may earn and collect points to use for shopping. As a regular user of the app, I did not like/appreciate the change. My points have been dropping rather than rising. I shop a lot, and I wish it could return to how it was before."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"My sister wanted me to get this so she can get free gifts. The money tree is a little stupid, if this isn't already a feature, if time runs out on the tree, and you have an amount of money from the tree to get most of the items but not all, you should be able to choose which item(s) to keep and not to keep. That was a long review and now my fingers hurt goodbye. Update: Yeah I deleted it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I rate the shein app because so far their promotional games is so far to me a joke! Today I shared the link for the magic draw card flip game So I can flip the card to get my last remaining gems to win $150 shein cash and $150 shein coupons. I sent it to so many of my friends that never had shein app before so helped get my credit for the game n three out of the so many friends of mine I sent link to. They accepted it physically right Infront of me and it didn't reflect on my end! It's rigged!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have been trying to delete my account now for a couple of days. The final link in the deletion process doesn't work and the link that was sent via email sends me straight to register for another account. I want my details and account deleted for numerous reasons!

I hope they ban aramex from delivery in south africa, I always get buffalo, nov 2023 i got aramex,my packages were both wet and damaged, some items inside were so damaged I simply threw them away. 2. I wish there was an option to not have everything in one wishlist. To be able to sort them like a takealot wishlist. To have ""wishlist folders"" so when its my kids' birthday for example, I can go into that folder and buy from there."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Crazily enough, I do not need notifications to buy your worthless products every 2 minutes. Really really annoying. Also the app is so slow, that browsing is mostly just an aggrivating experience."

I removed items from my cart and the price remains the same, then when I add other items to the same cart, THE PRICE GOES UP!!!!

They also put an experation date on points, KNOWING THAT IT TAKES LONG TO GET THEM. They rlly starting to scam ppl, I'm an influencer who loves to thrift, and my followers know abt shein. I've always said how I've bought from shein. But now, I might just reconsider finding another thing. Shein needs to take what were saying into consideration more."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is really good and quite helpful when shopping but at times when I need something from shein it doesn't have it like for instance I want to buy Galaxy A04s phone case but they don't have that..like it tends to get frustrating because from where I live they have very expensive phone case like up to $25 to $50 dollars but front shein its much more cheaper. Hopefully shein can bring in more phone cases and much more..☺️☺️☺️

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Love it, except the prices are all over the place. And be careful if you hit order and you have any deselected items, you ordered it and it's not always easy to catch. Best way is to not store payment method in the program."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"(Changed from 5 star review for a few reasons) i love SHEIN, it's been my go to since it came out. But its not fun to use anymore,rewards aren't issued, discounts only half applied if at all. My last 3 orders had items missing and i never got them replaced or refunded. Unable to make wishlist as before, unable to use in-app cash smh. It used to be the best app,now not so much."

My last order included Human hair extensions which are fabulous! 🤩 I wanted to leave a positive review with some photos I took, but can't find where in the app. Thank you so much! Shein is my number 1 shopping center! 😍🌸💜"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Edited to one star: This company steals your money! They take an order and turn it into several small orders so when a shipment comes if there are things missing you can only claim things that are in one sml order together. They won't even have anyone reach out to try and fix it after closing all other claims because they are from the same shipment. Missing 18 of 30 things and they were Xmas gifts. I'm closing my membership and deleting. I hope I can stop someone else from getting scammed!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Super disappointed in Shein. You can't even use your reward points and get free shipping. They add shipping even when it's a free shipping day. It defeats the whole purpose. Also they send you way too many notifications. They no longer honor promos on marketplace items. Shein once was amazing. I'm done. Temu is better now.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You know, I love shein. Some of the stuff isn't up to par, but a lot of it isn't bad. If you read the descriptions and check the reviews there is plenty of gold to be found. But the amount of notifications this app sends me a day is insane. I hate it. I'd keep notifications on because I like to check in for points reminder, but it notifies me about 3 times a day to check in, whether I have or not, in addition to all the useless notifications it sends me a day that I never asked for."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The shein points is now applied only at 30% maximum? Please bring back the times when you can applied all the shein points you have collected. It's so unfair and really struggle for me to buy some stuff it's so expensive now, Unlike before where you can applied all Shein points and get the items almost 70%... Gonna uninstall this... it's getting useless now 🥲 and boring."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ordered a couple of hundred dollars worth of clothes for a trip. The status of my order said it was delivered 3 days early, but I didn't receive anything. Not a notice or my packages. The website and its chosen carrier gave me the run around, and after 24 hours of no answers or solutions, I'm frustrated and will never use this app again."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Buying clothes from this app is good, but I will still rate this app low. If you are going to create an event or game, like the FREE 5000 COUPON via Draws please make sure it is legit and not a waste of time. People are installing the app and participating on the event, but when we reached the last coin to be collected we received a message saying the game has been shut down due to unusual behavior. Very disappointing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Just wonderful. Always heard about Shein but had no interest BUT lo and behold, I'm still here kicking myself for not shopping with them sooner, especially for my kids. The fashion is great for the price. I just started using the app and have ordered and will be ordering as long as Shein is here. Love it. Could you please put back the original points? It use to be 5 points daily instead of 4. The star that is used when checking in daily needs to go, along with the page. Bring back the original."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Honestly deals are great, product is great, everything is kinda doodoo, the games feel like cheap lotto, and extensively tries to bring people through invites that makes it feels tacky and gross, the UI feels like a knock off Amazon, personally I feel like it should take the soft corner and condesce the alot of category's with pull tabs from the top."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Price and delivery, Price, they say one thing but when you check out it's cost more. Screen shoot or take a pic of the cart prices and then look at the checkout price. I hate liars. Delivery Their delivery service didn't even bother to ring my bell. 2 deliveries both left in the hall I guess cause I never got them. No one to talk to no customer service"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Im happy that there's lots of high end makeup products now but I could never use the vouchers when the amount of the item is over the amount of the voucher, it works before but now it does not and the points does not have a massive discount anymore unlike before. And there's no inviting of friends anymore. Like the 180 pesos off voucher it doesn't work anymore."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I was a fan of shein but recently i have scene that their prices on cart are cominf different when you press checkout it shows increase in price. The recommended coupon it shows it had clipped doesn't make any sense cuz before any coupon the prices come less after coupon it increases..plz me careful when you hit payment..
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's a scam that when you send invitations to other people that it only opens in their browser, and then the browser opens the app and doesn't allow the people to play the game because the app then says, ""Sorry, you cannot access the game on various sites simultaneously."

First, I ordered a T-shirt from shein for my son's birthday, did all the measurements, and picked the correct size, but the wrong one came. I ordered a bigger one, the bigger one just longer still too small, return it to only recidved 2% of my purchased price back . I will never buy any thing from Shein again 😒"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"SHEIN is a good place if you're looking for affordable clothes and accessories for yourself. Of course, there are extremely expensive items(for obvious reasons), but again, there's still something there for everyone. Now...here's my problem. The gift cards. My sister recently sent me a gift card and when I went to checkout, almost my whole cart wouldn't work with said gift card. I find that extremely dumb. And another thing, if the item is unavailable for gift card use, put that. Thanks."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Can't believe I'm seeing all these comments saying ""it's horrible"" from my experience it's GREAT, amazing clothes accessories for cheap. Yes some aren't the best material but really what did you expect when it's that cheap!? My daughter LOVES all of the clothes I've got her, amazing!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I really like SHEIN things there are affordable prices which I love and my items can even arrive a few days before expected time which is impressive. The shirts are fine for me but usually the pants material is thinner than I thought and sometimes the boxes that have some of the products are a litte damaged but usually the product is fine.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I need to edit my original feedback that I left. I did it out of frustration over ads, however the app itself and the service it provides is very good, therefore I will put aside my personal animosity for ads, which I understand are needed to run a business, obviously, and focus solely on the app and it's benefit. The app itself in the service it offers is very good. I apologize to the creators for the lack of clarity and the rudeness of my original post."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Great for shopping on a tight budget (for the most part) however PLEASEEEEE fix the size issue on the app. I enter my size into my profile and it never saves and it makes things difficult to make sure I'm buying the right sizes!!! 😔 btw I already reached out to in app support and they did not help.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to like shopping in here but then update system changed it all. They tell you to buy more so I could have free shipping but when used with points, you have to pay for shipping fee. Points usage are From 70% off down to just 30%.. this lessen my spending on shein. And I'm thinking to not buy again."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"They reduced the daily check in points you can get after the recent update. And they limit how much points will be applied to your order. Other than those, Shein products are if good quality. It's 8/10 for the quality based on the items I received. Hopefully they will get the daily check in points back to what it's used to be."

It's not right. We are shopping shein the brand and company. Not our fault you guys are going thru a marketplace or w.e that means. It's a loophole they are using as a way to force us to pay these huge prices poor quality products. And I actually bragged before regardless of quality cause of price point.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I really love shein and enjoyed buying stuff here but my concern is why it's so hard now to earn points when i start using shein its part of my routine to check in and earn points so that i can use it on my next purchase but now its so ******* hard to earn points and because of that i don't enjoy shopping at shein now. Before shein have a lot of discounts but now just a few discount and a very small amount of points my friend also told me that is why she is not using shein anymore.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It has shipping fees I personally hate shipping fees so I wish I didn't have it otherwise it's a pretty good app to use and buy stuff but I do feel like it would be better off with no shipping fee you know you could like still get it if you have like a lot of money but as a person like me I don't have a lot of money so it's pretty hard because I have to pay $9 for a $1 thing do what you do bestie poos and just stay safe on this app and keep on shopping I guess
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love shopping with Shein. 99% of my purchases are as expected & of pretty good quality in comparison to other similar sites.

Better off just getting temu or just sticking to amazon at this point."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Worst company ever! Their clothes are cheaply made, never the right size, and to get your money back is nearly impossible!! Even after showing them multiple times the receipt that was sent to my account stating that their warehouse, in fact, did receive my returned items, they still argue that they don't have them?!?!? Total rip off!! I will never order from them again!! As soon as I get my refund back for the junk clothes that I never wore, I am uninstalling this joke of an app!"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I thoroughly enjoy using this app and placing orders. It is easy and there is a large variety of items to choose from. There is a points system for logging in daily which allows you to save money on your order as well as vouchers which can be applied to orders on certain items. Thank you Shein.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It took me some time to post 5 stars, but now I believe SHEIN is at a point where it deserves them. I had many complaints and during the past 6 months I noticed improvements and changes that make me find what I'm looking for easier, helping customers with points and variety. Please add more Halloween decor during the rest of the year."

It's usually USPS for me to track and the last time it said UPS, I clicked the link to try and track and I never received my package. It's some kind of hacking scam going on with that fake UPS site in tracking. They get you to enter your tracking number and then steal your package. I'm just hoping I get this one, didn't enter my info this time. Shein needs to investigate"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,One of my friend recommended me. I ordered 2 ladies and one child dress. Ladies dress are same stuff and quality first time I became satisfied with any online shopping. But child one was average as its price was also cheap. They can make good quality in that even they can keep price bit high. But over all the best app if anyone go for online clothing. If all apps will go same standard so no one will disopinted. Thank you shein.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's not too often that such a fabulous style is offered at such an affordable price! Their selection is amazingly large and so far I've yet to discover anything to truly complain about. In fact, the item which I ordered actually arrived a few days before it was due. Needless to say, that's a first ever experience with ANY company which ships their products directly to customers' addresses. I'm beyond pleased with Shein and expect that you will be, too, if you give them a chance. -LizB"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I've ordered a few times but the last 2 times I've ordered from them not all the items are in the package and when I contact support I get no response so I will be deleting this app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very very bad shopping app, never buy from shein because they have no return facility , no one will listen to u if u will get something bad, so money is all wasted by buying from shein. They have no customer support system.poorest shopping app"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love it! But I'm updating my rating. Some of the delivery companies Shein uses here in SA is called ""iMile"" where there is a lot of bad reviews of people's stuff going missing or never being delivered. I would suggest Shein sticks with Buffalo or Aramax. We don't have a choice when picking the company that's doing deliveries and I think it's time we do."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,ever since the last update i'm unable to add anything to my wishlist. EVERYTIME i click the heart button EVERYTHING tells me 'system error' and item is never added to wishlist.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I love the app but the only thing is that Shein doesn't have the Botswana Pula (BWP) but it has the location. And I have to use the Rands(ZAR). Please fix this problem. Thank you.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Orders sent to wrong address twice. Address changed on app. 2 orders sent to previous address. Not happy at all. Disabled and very disappointed.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I honestly hate this company. My package was marked delivered and wasnt. I was refunded but waited to see if my package would still arrive. I asked them and they now claim my package was lost which was not stated before. They told me I could just reorder the stuff but it won't come on time. I need my package as soon as possible. Very irresponsible and unprofessional. This is not how you do business
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,IT works good but when before I sign in the prices will be low but when u use it alot of times after signing on the prices will be higher.. Another thing is that SHEIN keeps sending me emails which is disappointing 😡
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,When I learn of shein it was 😮 to see Style layout are neatly organized..quality is very good and price is really affordable. Shein is the place shopping Refund is easy and no hassle..
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I've been trying to delete my account for weeks and they won't allow me to. They didn't my last three packages. The points are pointless. Their customer service is terrible and unprofessional. Their stuff is cheap and you definitely get what you pay for. I no longer want anything to do with this app. It's horrible.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Ok so first of all, prices are AMAZING!! I love shein because the prices are really nice, however shipping takes WEEKS. The reason why I took 2 stars off is because when someone sends you a shein-invite link, it says u get 10 things for FREE, no charge. They're right about that, but makes u invite close to 20 people to get them for free, or lose them all. I HATE when people go against their word, thats what shein did. Those links r not worth ur time."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"All in all I like the app. You need to read the reviews before purchasing something, though. They have free shipping some days if you keep watching. I am giving three stars because of the Puppy 🐶 Keep game. It has been lagging and kicks me out quite often. This needs to be corrected."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Worthless app, Yesterday I paid money from convenience store but after 32 hours also it show unpaid in shein app. From yesterday I reported my problem in FAQ and Customer Care Center it take too much time I don't know my problem will fix or not and If my problem will not fix then my money will return or not."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Promotions are scam! Can't change size of the size of order which was not ship yet that you will end it up to cancel. The worst is promotion is redeemable anymore once cancelled.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"good app easy to navigate, I would say there's better quality and that stuff. the app lags out sometimes and makes me leave the app for no reason what so ever.."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a nice app and good products, but it's high time you give someone a chance to cancel the Order because sometimes people have a Change of mind, i can't Just Order today and the next you wake up no cancelation"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Can't talk to a human. The use SpeedX a bad delivery service. Their email don't work. As well as their rating page on Google.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is getting worse while it lasts, for some reason my poins disappear so quickly. I check-in every day because to earn points is so hard. Why you keep on reducing it? Unlike before I reached to 1000+ points but now it only reach 'till 500+"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"For shopping, works well. But Shein resets the setting so that they can sell my info almost every single day. Today they reset it 3 times. Extremely scummy."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Ever since I used Shein, it's always been free shipping. Well, not anymore. SF is even higher than the actual item/s I am buying. Thought of you're a VIP, you always get free shipping as courtesy. Oh well... Hello Temu 💚"

I cancelled my entire order, they decide to short me $5 on my card & put it in points that I never received w/out my authorization. To insult my intellegents the refund me the points I already earned wouy ¢5=500 points. I check my points daily g keep track of them. They can deposit points but can't reverse it. I don't care if they can't even give me deserve but at least give me my money back. Terrible"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Poor d3livery system... They don't keep to time... I made on order for more 4 weeks... it's yet to be delivered. After a week plus... I made order on temu.. it has been delivered and you compensating with 50cents for delayed order is ridiculous
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I used to love shein not until they change the pointing system on earning points please bring back the pointing system before and also the points got expire when you're not using it.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like the version and the points system where the points icreases everyday...you need to bring it back...i think costumers are benifiting from it, where as now you only get 3 poits a day..😒😒😒"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app will not accept my password no matter how many times I reset it. Too difficult to even get started . Need better options.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Updated my shipping address and all of my product got shipped to the wrong address. Will never use this app or site again. Cant even contact customer service.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,When I click on the link of the item it doesnt redirect to the product but keep telling me to download the app on app store even though I had it in my phone already
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Deadass just another temu with all the prices and ""free items you can win"" I wouldn't bother with it. To be fair I would bother with any app like this now"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Scam. It tells you to invite people to get £200. You can never get it. It counts up to £199.90 but then never allows me to get any further.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Absolutely hopless customer service. I have received a completly wrong package and there is no support that u can get to resolve. $158 worth of goods have been delivered incorrectly
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app was my favorite and I buy there all the time, but recently they become awful. The customer service is ridiculous.They don't help they are intentionally.Drag you along just not to give you a refund. They don't have a common sense. And they don't understand apparently english cause every time they react differently to what I say. Potato, and they answer me cheesecake. There is no connection between both of the things. I'm really angry and I think how I can make. Something"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Their quality of clothing is just dropping ever time I order. So sad because I really believed they care. They now also false advertise coupons that disappear when you have to pay.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The new layout sucks, is so tiny makes me not want to search or buy anything. Ruins the shopping experience"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Unable to make any purchase. So disappointing. I did contact customer service and I did everything I was told to do and my payment is still being rejected. I use my same card on Amazon and I have no issue purchasing anything there.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love everything about this app but for my past few items were ""lost in delivery"" and/or never showed up and I've checked my address to be sure it was right and it is. Super annoyed!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Honestly I love shopping here. Everything I've gotten. has been the best quality so far! And I'm so lucky that Shein is so understanding with refunds and everything else!! I haven't had a problem here yet and I highly recommend shopping here PLUS THEY HAVE AMAZING DEALS!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The games about winning 300 dollars do not work at all. It told me to invite a friend to play it again. It work and I got to play it again. But I won 1 cristle and It instantly changed the number to 0.8. I would not recommend the win money games because it do not work. But besides from that shien is a good app to buy things from!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Um weird thing happened just a couple days ago. I didn't confirm these orders or proceed to but them theu were just simply sitting in my basket. Yet they came up as receipts in my email, which really peeved me off. $160 later I dont recommend at all!! No longer trust this website because of that. I DID NOT ORDER THESE THINGS!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I like the price and the varieties but then when the order is being delivered in 2 packages you can't give delivered for the one that came and also you can't return until you get both the packages or else you have to pay if you want to return the second package later. So basically have to wait for both the packages to arrive.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The items are overpriced and the shipment is very slow. Also they made a program where they make people think that they can actually win 5000 by inviting people. But doesn't really make you win. Very inconvenient.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"As it turned out, I had an incorrect phone number and the goods were not delivered to me and the money was not returned!! The support did not answer, although I wrote several times. An answer came by mail that Shane's mail was full and they were not receiving messages! Terrible"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Perfect! Cheap prices, has reviews and can get money off things by logging in and checking in on the calender icon everyday"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Cheaters! Cheaters! Cheaters! They terminated players mini games with out providing proof or what rule was broken. They are doing it when you get close to winning so they don't have to honor the prizes you will win. Customer service is no help. I will never spend a dime with them again which is sad because I like their stuff and was putting together a big order to make on Sunday. Your loss Shein, I hope not wanting me to win my little prize is worth the money I will stick to spending with Temu!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have always loved shein recently I ordered February 10th, and theres been no updates. They told me keep reaching out to usps ( WHO NEVER RECEIVED MY ORDER, AND IT STATES I CANT CONTACT REGARDING WHAT THEY DONT HAVE). Fast forward im asking for a refund they are refusing until March 2. I have talked to over 87 associates at this point they keep saying "" be patient"". 19 days is patient with no update! Then when I ask for a location/eta they say "" sorry"", they dont know where it is either!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have been using this shein app for years I have spent over 10.000 to point I some time buy 3 to 4 times a month. Never had Issue till now. I received broken box with missing Pieces of coat rack that was 30.00 and there is no Customer service. Doesn't mater how many time you hit the button you never speak to a person just rebot. So now I'm pissed not only that the Pieces don't even fit to build it. There's no way of building it even with the missing pieces.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Don't advertise for a game that you have no intent of allowing people to actually win. Got my game down to the last $0.1 then they began cutting everything up into even more fractions (ex. $0.04) all the while every referral prior was taking off whole numbers. When you go into the terms of service for the game they sneakily add in that they determine the value of the referrals and that they won't all be counted the same way. SHAME ON YOU for taking advantage of people. How very disappointing.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Everything i have bought from this site has been amazing, exceptional service, excellent products! I have no complaints whatsoever."

After ordering expidited shipping my package was delayed and I was given no new updated information. When inquiring about this the customer service was no help. Good ideas, bad execution."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love the items in the app but there's a kind of a problem the prices and the shipping fee are really expensive like my mom bought me a bracelet kit and the price was 463 including the shipping fee try making the shipping fee less expensive like anything below 200 that will be great but it's ok if u don't but pls do it and I recommend to put more free shipping it's really great if there's more free shipping thats all I could say ig
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It used to allow me to remove the Express shipping on my laptop but now, I don't have that option, there are times I order something way below the $129 but the exoress shipping sharges $29. So, can u see the inconvenience of ordering a $2 thing and the express shipping won't come off and charges me up to $30 Shein, please fix it, I don't mind waiting long, why must I pay the express shipping when I clearly don't want to"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"i didn't like the new update where you deduct the points for daily check in. that was my only motivation for opening the app and for keeping the streak so you'd not go back from day 1 (1 point). it would be more fun if you would return the old daily check in. Also, when ordering, I can no longer maximize the points."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible service. Delivery times said 8-13 working days but it's been almost a month and still haven't received anything. If you want to talk to the support, you're talking to a bot. You can't get the option for a refund unless you received the package so if it goes missing it's your own problem. Rather go buy in a store and atleast you know that you get what you pay for"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So dissappointed, i cant even register it always shows sorry system updating and its been months already. What is the problem shein hk??? Can you fix this priblem."

Every time they offer prizes, I complete all the missions, but they say in the mission that I share the prize with some of my friends, and when I share the prize and they click on the link, nothing appears even though they clicked on the link!! I hope you fix this problem😕)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Amazing! Shein is an unbelievable place to find good quality clothes for next to nothing. I recommend reading the reviews and try to find a customer with a similar body shape as your own to see how a particular item looks on them. It's a good way to gauge how the same article of clothing will look on your own body.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,please bring back the old way of giving points during daily check-in. this is getting stingy already. they only give 2 points a day now compared to up to 15points before plus the coupons are only applied to selected products. u can do better than that!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Big scam. The coupons do not add up, the final price is not the real one. If you add yourself the numbers, you will see that they always use the full price, not the ""estimated price"" that they claim it has a discount. I deleted the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,2nd time ordering. And mail has had no tracking update for almost 2 weeks. And Noone knows nothing. Not even usps.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I'm not really that disappointed but id like to say what made me really don't want to buy from shein anymore. Three months ago I ordered from shein because I was going on a trip and really needed something to wear. I ordered 12 days before the trip so I was expecting it a day before or after. Well guess what. It never came it's been three months no sign of my packages while I've been writing to costumer service about it and been asking for a refund they don't give it to me. I'm still waitingtbh
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"First time I Order in Shein And the Dress I Order is Quite Big for me. That's why I try to Return. But up to now still I Don't Get my Refund. And they have No Costumer service agent to Talk and solve the issues. This is Not Good. Plus the Shipping fee was Expensive. And the Item to Return will Give you Hassle just to Go to J&T Shop. It will cause you Time, Effort and Transportation fee just to Go there. And the Refund still they Don't Process it. This is Really Hassle."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,There are no other shipping methods available all I'm seeing is express shipping and that cannot be unchecked I've tried multple times please fix!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is an amazing clothing company, I don't know how they make such good close, there things are pretty affordable and I am in love, one person said it was terrible and that they paid £9 , which I don't think is fair because they have to ship a long way especially since their are alot of people ordering from them because they are AMAZING , honestly I don't care if people say the brand is bad I enjoy it and their are so many categories to choose from which is so helpful and it's a 5 star for me"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Honestly so far my first purchase was good loved the clothes I got however I went to go do clothes shopping for ALL of my kids and discovered u all put a price limit on how much ppl can spend and won't let u order anything until the order is fully shipped makes no sense that yall would put a price limit on how much someone can spend at one time
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,it's very great to shop the quality is the best and when you are first timer to shop they a many coupons I love it well.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Very disappointed in I had my entire wedding planned on this app for the day before I purchased everything everything went blank and I had nothing saved not even on my wish list not even in my shopping cart this has happened to me more than unfortunately I can't remember every tiny little detail that was on my shopping list very disappointed I guess I'm going to have to buy from temu net worth the headache if you're trying to plan anything special
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this app!! There's a ton of products to choose from, I especially like and recommend the clothing that they offer. Specifically the ROMWE clothing. This app is easy to use and I haven't come across a glitch so far."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely LOVE shein. It's amazing and has very cheap and reasonable prices with free shipping if you are spending more than $29 without coupons, and you will get around 2 coupons every day when you go on to the app. This lowers the prices so much, making it even cheaper. The package normally arrives around 3 days to a week, depending on where the product is getting shipped from. Honestly absolutely amazing. You should definitely download and sign up to to the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I started to shop from Shein in 2020, everything was great, and the products were ""exclusively"" Shein's. But now, when you search for a particular item, the result will be flooded with ""marketplace"" labeled items, which is annoying and makes it hard to find what I look for. It can't be filtered either. Shein just gradually becomes like Aliexpress or Temu."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Hi just wondering why in recent updates, you have literally made shopping with you harder, the way you click into product its less easier to add to boards, also tons if products similar come up.instead of adding item to board, and simply clicking to add, and out again, the website and shopping in general was perfect, why ruin it when it's perfectly fine, the saying is if it's not broken don't fix it. Please go back to the way it was, it'd less enjoyable now"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You'd think they would have improved over the last few years, but no. I remember when Shein coupons were not maxed & you'd actually receive the amount off depending on the %, but now they're all capped. (No incentive to order big) Since they've gotten the Marketplace they superimpose coupons so now you barely get anything off your order. No free shipping for small placed orders. Everything sells out extremely fast. I order less & less from them now and will start using Temu & AliExpress 💯👌🏽"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible! I purchased over 40 items on November 11, 2023, which is last year, and I still haven't received them! I did try to contact them by email and chat. Chat is horrible! It's all robotic, no live person. I did contact USPS, and they said that they couldn't find my packages even though the trash said that they still are in ""transit,"" not being sent or delivered yet. I'm very disappointed and I will have to request refunds asap! They owe me huge credits for being delayed over almost 4 months"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I would give 5 stars, but SheIn has recently allowed one of the Marketplace sellers to swindle people. The products I usually buy are good quality for a decent price. I recently bought a set of garden fences that were $25 for a 20 piece set. After a week, I was contacted saying that the product was no longer in stock and that I could either exchange or refund. Immediately after canceling, I found the same seller selling it for $45. So it was in stock, they just wanted to charge more."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Trys to trap you into not being able to delete your account. The app changed my own password for me and made me reset it to make it a bigger hassle to delete your account.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"No method of contacting customer service, just a useless AI bot. Regarding your response. It does not work. The bot continues to try to answer, and there is never a method to submit an issue. You should at least provide an email option within the app."

Everytime it opens the app after the advertisement, honestly thinking of deleting the app completely because of the in game ads. Seriously fix this!!!

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is really good and had many amazing options on what to buy, I have purchased many items from shein, and they were all amazing quality. Overall, it's an incredible online shop."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Things has definitely changed with shein,a lot of deception going on there,you buy items, they promise to give you 20% /25% discount,by the time am checking out i discovered that the amount to be removed has discounted fee was added to my initial total amount so it appears money was removed but it still the same amount 😞, Secondly I get billed for complet set only to discover it only the top or bottom advertised. . This is disappointing"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"bruh, I hate shein so much. So I ordered a package and it changed the address to a city that is HOURS away from mine mid shipping. And when I went to customer service they wouldn't let me select the item or get my money back. I now officially HATE SHEIN!🤦🏽‍♀️😒"

And their customer service is bad,been calling until my airtime was finished but no answer. Never again am I ordering from SHEIN"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app is a scam. Yes I have won free stuff on it but the second I won a puppy game my next puppy game was shut down in the middle of it. Do not recommend this shady app. Multiple people's accounts are getting flagged for no reason.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I will never order from shein ever again. The custom duty and tax is way too expensive. It's like I'm making up for the discounted amount from the clothes. Buffalo logistics the worst.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Loved shein for years now for home products, pet things, and clothing and in general useful tools. But recently shein has started using aramex which has been known for 5-10 years to be a useless shipping company, my orders have always been super quick but now it has been delayed by several weeks with no update. Please stop using aramex and shein will do alot better in NZ. Kind regards, happy customer :)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Never using again!!! Refused to allow me to make my purchase when my credentials were right..contacted customer support etc. and they did absolutely nothing.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"As the discount given by shein goes on little by little, I think that happens with every update of the app, I hope the 70% deduction of shein points will be returned. Return the old shein like the year 2020-2021"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app was really great but i am absolutely fuming with the issues regarding the delivery of my parcels, 3 or 4 times now the delivery men have left my parcels on my front doorsteps despite my parcels going missing those 3 and 4 times it has happened again because obviously despite the apologies im not really being listened to properly"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I like the app but the customer service needs improvement. I order all the time and have been satisfied with the products I have gotten but for some reason this order I got half my order then the rest of the items were put under review. They said I needed to send proof of payment so I did I use afterpay to pay for my order I sent them proof multiple times and the proof wasn't good enough. Don't accept something that you will not accept as proof
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app, get to choose from their variety of items, they are also slowly adding more options of items from different categories"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After purchasing a few items on Shein, I had 2 unauthorised charges. Never save your card details on Shein. Please use paypal with 2fa on. After this scam, I contacted them but they weren't helpful. Lesson learnt"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,My experience with Shein is good but I think the order I am waiting it will be the last one until they change a logistic company. Buffalo SA is very terrible to us. They make is talk to robots that don't understand our frustrations. They never answer their calls. It's terrible. Please Shein look for another logistic company or you'll lose business

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's good and easy to use. but the problem is the company's you give our products to deliver takes long time. Now have not received my last order. why?

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've already this website 5 stars because the best clothes on it because of the clothes that sells it is a spy stuff not any less if you give it any lesson you're just making fun out of it because it's the best clothes website I've ever will been on
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,my shein app is not like other people shein apps it wants my street number and a complex building instead of my home address. it doesn't show address line 1 or address line 2
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It is awesome. I really love Shein it is such a good app to order clothes and bags. I really recommend shopping from this app. YOU WILL LOVE IT!!

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,prices r soooo cheap but some stuff isn't rlly good quality and a lot of the sweaters/jackets or some tops have this weird puffy material and sometimes it goes away sometimes it doesn't
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It is difficult to recommend Shein to someone else. Bad return policy and all items ordered never received but fully paid. Never!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I like SHEIN compared to other alternatives we have here in the Philippines. I think it is because the price is kind of higher here that's why you get better quality than others. I also like that points can be applied to all products but I wish they would not expire.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Adverts became a bit less to start off, but are increasing again. Some adverts keep on repeating and do not go away, abuse a few minutes of my time each time"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Many people are criticizing this app but for me it's very good because the clothing quality is amazing. Maybe for some buyers it's not but for me it is. I've been shopping there for a long time and not a single time it has disappointed me. Recommend!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"SheIn have a game which you can win 5k off voucher, but before you can win this you need to invite new users. I don't see a problem with it but when I successfully fulfill all the invites I needed. IT SAYS ""network connection problem"" AND IT RESTARTED, FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST MY WIFI LAGGING BUT WHEN I OPENED THE APP AGAIN IT WENT BACK FROM THE START! I WAS SO CONFUSED SO I OPENED THE APP, AGAIN! AND IT SHOWED THE SAME INVITES I NEEDED FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME. FIX THIS SHEIN! SCAMMERS"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is my favorite shopping app. But now, you can't use all the points when you check out. You can use only 30% of points. Please do bring back the Shein we were used before ! This is very disappointing !"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I didn't like all the temu ads and was looking for a new place to shop. Walmart is sometimes too expensive. I tried this one, and so far, it's been really good . Good deals"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I don't like it anymore there's a lot of changes.. The price is getting higher then u cant used all you're points in check out.. Check in every day is just like a waste of time. All I want is to save by collecting points and now it's useless..

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Chinese app with lots of chinese junk. This is a cheap dollar store website that steals designs and product ideas from massive brand names. They rip off everything from massive retailers. Also the clothes arent accurate sizing at all. Delete.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Excellent prices and my first order was easy and painless from shopping to delivery. Awesome experience.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I was trying to return some items from my previous order but due to technical issues/glitch in app return could not process. Since return time was over I am stuck with those items which I don't need them/don't fit me. Customer service didn't help me with this issue.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to like shein but now I hate the new update where you can only use points to deduct 30 percent of the total price of the item, and they don't provide free shipping. Unlike before, every weekend there is free shipping even you only bought one item with the price of 70 pesos. I hope Shein will turn back the old version/policy."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love the items on Shein, I just don't like that they scam you by lying about prices, charges, and discounts they offer. I calculated the price of my items, and it was $40 less than what Shein calculated the total to be."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Told me to accept invitation for 10 free gifts, after wasting time picking them, told me to get more people in to get it. Not worth it. Time wasted."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I had to uninstall due to being slammed with Shein adds that auto opened the app. I'm getting at least 30+ a day and it's super annoying! Not to mention that almost all the clothing is made out of full polyester now. Plastic clothes aren't that comfy and the hard plastic tags are SUPER annoying.

I contacted Shein numerous times on the app and no one ever got back with me. I contacted USPS and filed a complaint with them as well as my bank. I still have not heard from Shein customer service, still no package, and still no refund. Shein does not value their customers!"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I truly Love this shop on line company. The sizes of 96% of waerables are true to size. Their little knick knack items it's a hit or miss but that's the gamble you take when items come to you at or under $2.00. Knowing this when I started spending my money with them made it less stressful when I would get a .85 cent item and it works a couple of times I got what my money bought. Thanks, Renee"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love this app, but because of the new update I don't think I love it the same way before.

Recently, I get to buy more from Teum than She in, because they have lower prices within the same products of she in , with free return, free shipping and free fees to Jordan, and lastly they have a very good and quick customers service"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's good, like, better than timu ect but not like amazon the things are cheap and we can get points to buy and review the products it has its up and down but if you are looking for an app with good stuff and cheap price and fast costumer service this is the one!"

You literally have to dispute with your bank to get your money back. Horrible and ill be expecting some generated response to my feedback.Bottom line DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Awesome app ever. Its very easy to use and there is always enough time to use coupons and points. The game are easy and fun not like Temu which is all lies and don't give you anything.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"A few weeks ago I gave this app a 5⭐ but I changed my mind the ""free 150 point""/""free gifts"" are so fake when I tried it I was at 99% I then invited a new app user and low n behold it's goes to 99.8 which should not be possible because it did not add that before in the cards so I invited around 5-6 new app users It then makes this big deal with fireworks so I thought I had but nope it then went to 99.9 then99.91% it said nothing about that in the beginning THERE SHOULD BE NO .1"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Unethical business, been ordering for some time and although the quality is often terrible has some decent products that's value for money. Lately though order more than 200 euro products 2 months ago, the chatbot is impossible to find a solution ans they continue to ignore my feedback and complaints. It's now possible that they will never deliver and scam my funds. It's obvious to me that Temu is by far the superior choise for Chinese products."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Ok, so shein is a good shopping platform overall, but there is one problem that i won't tolerate. The fact that shein literally scams people. I ordered a clothing item on accident and refunded it and it said I would receive a refund within a week. THAT WAS LAST YEAR AROUND DECEMBER 8 and I haven't received back my money OR the clothing item. After that I hardly wanted to buy anything again."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It was great until they said my 60 dollar order was delivered and it wasn't.

Bummer.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The 2 shirts I got I was happy with and the 2 pairs of shoes were higher then my expectations but the issue I had is that I ordered a size 11 and they have down size 11's are EU 44. Well EU 44 is actually a 10.5 US.A 45.5 EU is an American size 11.So of course they were way to tight.They need to advertise there shoes sizes to be true to size.So if u are size 11 do not order what they consider 11. Also the return process has been very easy and of no charge to me.if not for wrong sizing 5 stars

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Shein was better when it mainly centered on clothes. Now the app is just flooded with so much random stuff and obnoxious ads and graphics. You can tell they're trying to be another Temu or Aliexpress. They've also become very stingy on coupons and points.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm giving one star mostly because of your delivery courier, SpeedX, and plus because you are being so unhelpful and irresponsible about your customer's issues that your couriers make. I'm gonna stop shopping with you guys.

That's way crazy and unacceptable 😤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Shein is great app with all e details you may need to know when ordering .one should take their time to read product description with regard to type of material used and even size of the product.reviews also assist in ordering and also on what to expect.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"App has been ok for the most part, but the section where to leave reviews is broken. Tried to leave a review, but it autofills boxes incorrectly, randomly pastes reviews from other products, and makes me fill in the sizes over and over them says I didn't fill in the sizes."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love shein! 5 hate that points ""expire."" I have been trying to build my points and finally had 10 something, and now I'm back down to 7 something because they ""expired"" some people dint have the the money to buy all the time so the points help to be able!!!

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I placed an order on December 26, confirmed on December 27 including payment, delivery in 11-15 working days. Nothing has changed since January 6, 2024, it is in transit and I have to be patient. I can't find anything about the order. The customer service does not work, I tried by email and it tells me that they do not have space to receive emails."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I do really like this app. But when I'm trying to do the invite friends thing for the gifts, it doesn't work. I invited like 10 friends and it didn't work!! 😡😡😡😡 STOP SCAMMING US"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I wasn't satisfied anymore and disappointed. Because I discover that the discounted items are not true. They didn't less to the actual prices. And also the delivery charges was free. I tried to summarise my orders and totalled it.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,They are a SCAM! I spent $140 last night woke up this morning and half of my items were canceled saying unpaid yet I have nothing being funded to me and I'm now being charged $140 for the first half of the stuff that wasn't! Do not waste your time don't charge you for things that you won't even receive!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Pretends that you can return or refund but really just takes you back and forth between random stuff youre never asking to do. It is definitely a scam and is obviously lying about being able refund anything.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I am so aggravated with this app they told me that I was going to get 10 free gifts. And then I picked out the 10 gift and then they they kept putting boxes on the screen that I had to click to take off money which the gifts were already free so I don't understand that. And then finally when I add my address and everything it says you have nine dollars to take off and I can't even do that unless I share it with people which is freaking ridiculous I'm done with this you are scammers
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Scammers tried to claim they were Shein and giving away pallets of Shein returns. All we had to do was pay for shipping of $9.95. Once you put in your credit card information they go into your account and tried to pull out over $100. They went into my account and tried to take out $185.00 but my credit card account caught the fraud and contacted me right away. The companies name is Pixie Touch. They said the website is not affiliated or endorsed by Shein. You don't get that information.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Stop sending me 20 notifications every 5 minutes. It's annoying. Terrible app. Just use temu or aliexpress. They let you customize your notifications and have the exact same clothes for the same prices, if not cheaper."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have did with my international card purchase and they send me the link to verify but the stupid link his going direct to the main page which i cant verify i mail them but and send the proof but useless customer service which cnt help me out and cancel my order which is not good so please when u download this app be sure first im not happy with them and i will never order again they are not supporting
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ordered from the app and everything was good however I returned some things as I didn't like the fit. I recieved the funds into my Shein wallet but when I tried to withdraw my money it failed. I complained and all I got was an email saying they unable to refund me die to an error on their side. So now I can't withdraw the cash and the money is not available in my wallet. With no turn around time either. Basically stolen.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If I could give this zéro stars I would. It sends ads into the Samsung Global Goals UN app and once the ad is finished, we can't donate to the United Nations app. Terrible practices. I pray one day you get wrecked by regulations."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,They didn't give me the packages I wanted and after 2 months it still never came and the waiting time or package delivery is very long and they showed me the price but then when I shopped and saw the price it was double.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Nice app nice things you get what you pay for but customer service is horrible they don't answer right away you have to wait for a long time plus they say they accept gift cards but the first time is ok after that they declined they don't accept gift cards anymore with or without google payment or as a gift card through the app so I'm waiting for an order to come and then I delete the app it's not worth my time ashamed
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I hated my last order to the extend that I deleted the account and regret setting up one. One of the devices I ordered, the USB cable (that came with product) doesn't fit ... And support are not helpful at all"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Has great prices but Ads and rewards are just gotcha with no real rewards to get more users Very disappointed with this mechanic to get more users. The issue is the that obvious gacha fake rewards for users to enter and share links like ( Win 500$) and things like that It is seeded , programmered to give same reward to every user that clicks the buttons. If you cant be honest honest about your deals then just dont do it"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Its fine now. Im calm now. I finally found an agent & they gave me the number of the delivery driver so the missing change was retrieved. I was just mad because this is the first time someone took advantage of me while shopping from Shein. But its solved now. If there's a problem regarding the shipping of your parcel, just track your product, contact FLASH and they will contact your delivery driver."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Good app. But sometimes it's tricky and lets you pay more . Why? You have input the promo codes, and you still pay the full amount. Overall, it isn't that bad."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I have oredere twice on she in and it was good. Good quality and arrived in time. But mybthird order wouldn't go through base on the fact that my shein app isn't updating and I've tried vatious ways which I did on play store but the update isn't changing on my phone. Need fixed.. Please tell me how to update cause i try and customer service isn't much help
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's so irritating when I unlock my phone I get ads from this app. Developer of this app it's a very cheap behavior you must stop it there is not only shein to shop online there are lots of app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The points sistem was one of the best things Shein used to have. Now it changed and you only cellect 2 points for day and lose almost 30 if you don't buy anything. This is ridiculous, it should go back to the way it used to be."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Scammer. I have a lot of people who participate their games but still no one can claim the 5k credit and coupons. Never again use this apps anymore. 70+ people who participate then still I can't claim the prize. What the hell.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I ordered an item. Return it for a refund. I used afterpay but never got my full refund. Only a partial. I will never buy anything from yous again. I been contacting customer service for a refund and I got the run around.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Still the shine premium and games seem to be a scam. I actualy stopped paying their membership it's not worth your mony. I am actualy considering terminating my acc. If they keep this fad going. Update I removed my payment Info. Terminating my account and deleting the app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have ordered multiple times and the shipping and delivery proces is always dast, all my items are alwas correct and delivered and the producrts have not once been of bad quality! I highly recommend Shein to everyone! All their products are affordable and they have a WIDE variety of products!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I only give 3 stars because tracking information is very slow to update. I received my parcel on 19th Jan but the parcel is still showing me waiting delivery, this is frustrating as I want to return an item but can't until I confirm receipt of the delivery. Shein resolved issue with 24hrs so updated to 5 stars"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I ordered four items They were all delivered today but they weren't delivered to me. I can't get in touch with anyone from Shein over the phone. They only message me. This is my first order and I'm not happy.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Every time it says ""1 more dollar and everything is free,"" I send the link to someone, and it doesn't cut the price. This is soooooo annoying. I hate this."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Was cool at first, then just got ridiculous with hopeless games and extremely long transit times, delivery is the worst and every package is delayed. They never compensate for the errors. Losing customers."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I can't log in. I log out because I can't open my cart or add items to cart in order to buy. The app doesn't work anymore. I don't know when the update happen... I CAN'T OPEN THE APP HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO CONTACT CUSTOMER SERVICE THERE???
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I can't order alot of items. It is want me to order 2 or 10 items out of 60 items. And i can't do that because it will cost more money and every items they ad vat in it
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Subject: Disappointing Experience with Shein I am compelled to provide a one-star rating based on my recent experience with Shein. Unfortunately, the drastic reduction in discounts from 70% to 30% has significantly impacted the affordability that once made Shein an attractive choice. This sudden change without apparent justification has left me disappointed as a customer. I urge Shein to reconsider its pricing strategy to ensure transparency and retain the loyalty of budget-conscious shoppers."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein, shop all the time. Not exactly pleased with the obvious photoshopping of the plus size models. There are clear fails."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Love the products but their customer care needs much improvement . They still have not replaced the itens missing on two different orders. That is the negative about Shein so far, I suggest to always check your order."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If I could give zero stars I would. Shipment never arrived, no actual phone number I can call just an ai chat bot. I want my money back but not sure how I'm going to get it back or how long it will take. I will never use them again. Temu has way better customer service."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Been buying things in this app and I do not like the new update. There's a limitation when using the points unlike before plus there are restrictions with the codes. It's not customer friendly ublike before.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"For the second time I am facing bad services, firstly on delivery time extended, now i was charged extra 22 Usd after arrival of my order because they split my order in two packages, trying to get a feedback/refund they kept sending me automatic replies and closing my tickets automatically. Very unsatisfactory service."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The import duties have gone up by a lot so I will have to think again. Also, I was charged more on my cc then the amount that was shown on the order. Anybody else had that happen? I noticed that I can't review my purchases so I don't get any points either. All this is recent and I never had complaints before."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Everything I've ordered was the right size to me and my daughter so far. My only complaint is how hard it is to actually get anything from the shein hauls or I applied for an ambassador position and the survey part wouldnt load. So I guess the only question would be are these positions real? Like can we actually try products for free and review them on here or not cause I've been trying to for a few years and have gotten no where
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I was on the app and when I try to buy something just ONE item it's like a dollar or two well that's great but when I went to check out it turns from one or two dollars to theax to 7 dollars to I went to temu and I bought a costume that was only like 50 dollars max that I had to spend and that's the whole thing but for a shirt on shein it's around the max money I spended on temu but yes you have to have the maximum of 15 dollars to check out and so forth so on I rather go on temu and shop.. Thx
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Scam application. lol. This application has a game which is a spin. Shein will provide 300 coins to spin and it cost 100 for 1 spin. But the circulating results is the same as everyone spinning randomly. lol. Shein will leave you a 99 coins and It says if you invite 1 friend, you will earn 1 coin. The invitation is a scam. I will not convert to coin. Shein is a scam. lol."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Extremely dissapointed with Buffalo logistics. My parcel from Shein arrived at their depot on Friday which is now 3 business days later and every day it says it's in dispatch for the past 3 days but nothing has arrived. For all I know my parcel has been stolen. When I call Buffalo logistics they offer no help to track my parcel. This is leaving a very bad experience about Shein I doubt I'll easily support them again
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Missing items from each shipment !!! Can't ever get a response from customer service . Great when I get my stuff bit items missing in each order . Not worth me buying from them ever!!!

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I would give it a five but there is no dark mode😭. My eyes are sensitive especially at night when I'm tired. Other than that I absolutely love this app! The ptices are unbelievably cheap!!😁
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The coupon no longer applies to all the items. Also the daily check in is no longer as good as the previous one. This app is getting more and more boring and not friendly to use.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I don't know how to shut off notifications. It's getting annoying with the constant messages for discounts and other stuff. I DON'T CARE. ILL ORDER WHEN I WANT TO ORDER!

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I don't like how the return is supposed to be for free but then you proceed giving me a return fee. Like I just returned this bikini swimsuit and my refund will be 1,64€ bc the return fee is 4,50€. Otherwise it would've been a 5 star."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Loved shein till they started using fast horse express as their courier. Will not be using shein anymore though as fast horse are the worst courier service I've ever come across. They just leave packages out on the street and there is no way to contact them though shein does give you their useless contact info. Both POS companies!

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I have ordered from Shein only one time but it was enough to understand how fast delivering app is and how good quality the products it has. They were so organized in the packet and they have so many things and sizes to choose from recommended 100%

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein and their stuff. Delivery it's getting longer (12days) but oh well. The only downside for me it's the expiry of the points. I had like £15 off and then it went to £6 as they've taken all the points, so not happy about that."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used to like SHEIN before but due to the new update, now I only get 3points everyday on daily check-in. Before I used to get atleast 10points if I accumulate days. Fix this issue please!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Horrible product doesn't work and can't talk to anyone . The worst online experience I ever have . Lost money because there is no customer service support
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I am about to play there promo game and now I can't participate the game because the system says 'were sorry about this has been shut down due to our system detecting unusual behavior . Possible reasons.etc First time ko ngalang mag download nito eh 😤 😮‍💨 1star kasakin
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like how affordable shein stuff is.. im also an app user but PLS BEWARE if you are only downloading the app for the FREE PRIZES.. there is no guarantee even though how many friends you get to click that link .. there is an 'up to' sign in the cut that you can get per friend, my case. I have 1£ to cut for free prize, invited 1 friend (new user) for 0.5£ cut.. 1 friend who is an app user (0.1 £ cut) ending up with 0.4 more.. funny thing, have 1 new user again but the cut is only 0.05£."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Would most definitely recommend Shein as a shopping app! Great quality items and great delivery services. Prices are affordable. Really had a great few experiences with them.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love the app there always something that catches my eye... But the only downside is they don't sell any phone case for my Motorola g stylus 5g phone and I was see cute phone case but I couldn't find any for the Motorola
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My experience was horrible because I found these really cute nails and it was only 77¢ but when I checked out it said 4 dollars like if it was 4$ den why it say 77¢ and its bc the shipping and i js don't think thats fair.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This expedited shipping is ridiculous, there's no information regarding this approach to shipment. I Press on it, in hopes I'd learn more about this shipment process and it immediately confirmed my shipment as 'expedited shipping', why is there no way to further confirm or cancel this."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"i like most of their clothes. its a really useful app for when im trying to look for new clothes, because the ones i find online usually dont look very nice."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This site is absolutely horrendous. They make mistakes with your order and when you complain they give you a real hellish nightmare to solve the issue. I ordered 10 packets of tiles equals 100 pieces and guess what they did?. They sent me one packet of 10 tiles!!!. I opened a dispute and submitted evidence of thier mistake and they said : ""The order shows delivered and NO refund will be issued"" They took over $150 from me by this mistake and I got my credit card involved.. I WON THE CASE!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,So I really love this site. Do you know what I miss about this website though? I miss how it used to give you links to the other items in the pictures. I can't tell you how many times I would have bought pieces of an outfit that were linked in the pictures.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,its such an amazing app and everything is so cheap. i tried 4 of the sheglam blushes and ordered cargo pants and makeup organizers. the blushes are so cheap and STUNNING! love it so much. 10/10
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Games are practically impossible, I have a friend group of 5 and invited all of them and yet I still needed to share it to more people, I know it's because it's over £100 wallet credit but I feel like we should still get £5-£10 wallet credit in the end"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My item got missing in shipping, SheIn said the will replace the item as this was a mistake at customs. Then I had to pay for the import tax on the replacement same amount as my original order totally unacceptable 😕"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Shein as gone very expensive. Triple the price it use to be. Way to long to deliver. It's changed so much .
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The app is not budget friendly shipping fees cost to much and the shipment takes time long transit and the item's are not that good as describe in the picture not budget friendly app 😕
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is good but their sizes aren't always true to size but never had problem when ordered the down fall is it takes a month to be delivered but it's sadly coming from China
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love this app, their true to their descriptions & pricing is amazing considering the material of the items aren't cheap! 🖤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love shein, but lately I been dealing with delivery issues more than 3 times. It's either very late or the delivery company doesn't deliver it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Everytime I play a game it kicks me off. I click once and i lose all off what did. Fix it. I would love to give this a chance
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Takes a long time 2 get delivered like super long, but the quality of the items. Is pretty good except for some of them👍👏"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Horrible customer service and bots. Lied saying I cheated to avoid me getting my prize i worked super hard for I gave alot of proof and they just sent stupid automated responses becuase they couldn't be bothered with me.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Very bad service system.I ordered some items from shein in 31 jan but today 16 feb it's still not delivered yet.what is this?They said they take 8/10 days for delivery but it's been more than two weeks.damn.i will never order anything from shein.Disgusting!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Your puppy keep game is cheating it's also locking up my tablet when I play the game I love your items but it is not fair when you try to get your Free stuff with the games and y'all cheat and you can't get ahold of customer service
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ever since an update I cannot change language to English. Only options are follow devices setting or Spanish. And both ones just use Spanish. It was working fine until an update Edit: I can't contact support because everything is in a language I can't understand. Just fix it so I can have nglush as the language no matter the country. It's not hard and it was working fine
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I use to love shopping on Shein until I started having to pay products that I never received. There shipping liabilities are becoming to be a huge problem. *cough USPS *cough* *cough* I'm convinced they are stealing products at this point.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"When I claim my shein points, it always I received only 1 point and said that I've reached the daily points limit. This is not what it used like before. Please fix it as soon as possible. Thank you for considering this reviews. Thank you!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The first couple of months were good and you had the option to use vouchers to get discounts, it's nice when you spend over £50 and safe some. Great idea. But now its starting to get ridiculous since all has changed with those vouchers, now you need certain items to actually spend them, unbelievable!! I actually spent over £85 on my last order and couldn't apply a vouchers because my items were not expensive enough. So this is my last order I will o Close my account."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"First order was finefor the most part. Ordering clothes online can always be tricky with sizes. I am keeping half and returning the other half due to size issues. Material on things I'm keeping are fine. The prices I learnt, show estimated in cart. Estimated with the coupon deducting a little from each item. In checkout it shows actual price for item then at the bottom shows the coupon deduction. Makes sense to me. My order arrived faster than Amazon. I had a good experience."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Eh... I love the app for the most part I buy quite frequently. The mini games now those are a joke. Continuous issues, especially if you're anywhere near reaching your payout. Customer service, I have nothing good to say. That bot that they use is ridiculous. And trying to get a hold of somebody else an actual person. Try again later is what do you get most of the time? When you're trying to return a product half the time you only get one option for a label. Becoming more and more disappointed"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Great styles and mostly better prices. The clothes are on either side of the fence for me as a larger plus size woman as some of the fabrics are advertised as flowy and loose but when I receive them they are the exact opposite. I appreciate that I don't have to have a cart minimum in order to check out which makes it super convenient for me.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Cheap and cute clothes. Obviously you get what you pay for. Minus one star for all the notifications that bother you throughout the day. A notification telling you that there's a price drop, then one telling you about reviews for a product you never saved, then another one for a ""flash sale."" On average, I wanna say I get like 20 notifications from them a day? But turn off the app notifications unless you want people to think you have tons of people texting you."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is is overall fantastic! There is so many cute stuff for adults and children aswell! However the delivery take FOREVER! Like a week or so. But the items quality makes up for this negative act! Overall, it is a great app whenever i go to check something i always get intrigued with something and end up buying it! It is a great app, many trendy clothes, great quality and so much more. Some of my favourite items are on there. My mum found it and overtime I loved it to! I Highly recommend it! 🦋"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Editing my review from 5 stars to 4, mainly because the notifications feel very excessive. I typically have notifications turned off, but when i place an order i turn them back one to get the updates. It is currently 2:00 PM and i have gotten 8 so far today. I do still feel like its a great app, love the deals, prices, products, all that. Its just the content ads trying to get you to open the app several times a day is quite annoying is all."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have had lots of items from shein and been very happy with most things only had to send a few back because of size issues
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I love all the products. My biggest and most important problem lies with their shipping. On the other side of the it's understandable sure. But the moment it gets here they drag it out and it take so long to get to me. And the tracking isn't always clear and notifies me about so many changes long long after everything happened. For their products and prices I give a full 5 stars. But until they fix that shipping problem. I'm sorry it stays 2. 😪
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I totally love this app thought it was going to be All defect items boy was I wrong. Excellent items. Items arrived in excellent shape and earlier than expected
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app and affordable clothes. Not every clothing piece is top quality(as you can tell from prices) so it's best to look at reviews and clothing descriptions before purchasing, but I have bought items of good quality for a cheap price. Delivery time mainly depends on when your buying the product, if you purchase something in December, for example, it will take longer than usual to arrive. Overall I've had only a good experience"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"❤Shein, Hate latest update. Under ""All Orders"" used to be able to quickly scroll thru thumbnails of all purchases all in 1 screen. Now have to select ""view more"" under each order. THEN if it was shipped in multiple packages you have to select & scroll through each 1 of those! Having to enter, exit & scroll thru multiple screens to find what I'm looking for takes 100x longer now. I do love their convenient return policy though and they are quick at processing returns. Some clothes R high quality."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have just started to use apps to shop. I wasn't comftable, cause some are very confusing. I have been a customer for a while cause I love the products and the prices. On my desk top I get interrupted at times or noises would get to me. This app is great cause it's easy to fallow and if u have questions move over to chat. I love it"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Slight better than temu but seems more focused for women. The "" discounts"" dont seem to add up and I feel it tricks you like Wish does. That's why I never use it. Not the most user friendly when trying to get the discounts and information on products. They use the ""Black Friday Sales"" to draw you in then the prices are almost the same. From two stars to one because of the 12 notifications a day!!! It tried to give it a chance but not worth the storage on your phone. Too many damn messages!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The most customer unfriendly marketplace. I bought items on their site. It took weeks more than normal for the delivery to be fulfilled which was further split into two packs. When they arrived, one item was missing. I contacted them and they refused to acknowledge their mistake or resend the missing item. Their communication was very poor and customer service appears none existent."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pros: - Good variety of items - OK descriptions and sizing info - Easy to place an order - Fast order processing time - First return for each order is free Cons: - Few search filters. - Customer support is slow and doesn't usually address the entire issue/understand what the customer needs. - Some items arrive damaged, should be better packed. - Not all items have enough sizing/fit information - The price of an item in the cart should change when the quantity changes, this is misleading."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I buy from here so I Knows the difference! I am buying for my family &the cart is empty 36+ items gone &now I have an issue if I want to continue buying from here. That's a waste of time for me to add my funds to an empty cart when my selection is now gone. It was a set price and adding funds to finish payment. If you want people to keep being customers have enough respect to fix the bugs. Stop over pricing thing after completing payment and emptying out carts! Frustrating and rethinking a lot.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I hate that when I go to pay, my payment increases; even after using the coupon. It used to be fun shopping at shein, I've spent thousands on this site but it seem like the more you shop the more they charge you. I also hate that they limit the number of things to purchase on flash sale. All these issues have drastically reduced my spending on shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It would sometimes not show the wishlist, then it will show and goes back ans forth like that, the app is updated yet this keeps happening. As an in general the app is okay, but this has been happening for sometime now. I also wish there was better display of the products rather than just making posts, like trying to see a hood, or the front of a phone case or waist on a sleeping pants. These things need improvement."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Login bonus doesn't work a lot of the time, including today. This means I've lost my streak AGAIN. The app just goes back and forth between showing the current login bonus screen and the old one. Since Shein already became so stingy about giving out points and decent coupons, I'm going to stop bothering with it. Their clothes just aren't quality enough for regular prices."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I just love all the products I have ordered 😍 but why can’t we ship watches to fiji? Please update the other apps can ship watches to fiji. Why can't shein.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Beware of Inaccurate Pricing I shopped on SheIn for the first time this year, and I was instantly obsessed. My main grievance is that prices are falsely advertised. The pre-tax price you see in your cart does not match with the pre-tax price you see once you checkout. You are not really receiving the discounts that are listed. Please pay close attention to this. Items are still more than reasonably priced, but do know the in-cart price is not accurate. I wish they would fix this."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"SCAM Application - DO NOT INSTALL, This app is a scam, you order items which never show up and if something does it is horrible quality, falling apart, loose sticking, etc.... they delay / drag out communications hoping you drop off or drag out your refund forever.... NEVER do expedited shipping, they charge you but it doesn't guarantee or help get you your items.... BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love SHEIN products, but I'm disappointed I bought a lot when i tried to use coupons it just disappeared. I believe the coupons are just a scam. I bought some cheap items at different times, Well, the items broke, i asked for return and I was out all the money for shipping, but they would refund the money for the items, which was almost nothing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Edit: I wish I could uninstall updates. I dislike how they stopped numbering how many items are left til you are done scrolling your search. It makes me want to shop less. I dont like how it hides items when you look at them priced high to low/low to high. I miss the old search filters including sleeve length etc. The app functions well enough but it's lacking.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Everything is fine until you cancel your order and request a refund, then you get the WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! I''ve cancelled my order and requested a refund, the order was never delivered and is still with the couriers, Buffalo Logistics, who also don't provide customer service at all! I've told Shein several times that the items were never delivered and they are just doing absolutely nothing about it. It's been more than a week and still nothing is being done. I will never buy from Shein!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Update: DON'T ORDER FROM SHEIN. Terrible customer service, app doesn't keep up to date with tracking info, refunds are a scam and delivery was a nightmare. Paid £9 for express & it came AFTER my standard delivery order, and both were ordered at the same time. When I asked for a shipping refund, they said they couldn't. Can't even chat live to someone you have to submit a ticket and wait 24 hours for a reply. Absolute scam. Don't be blinded by their cheap pricing, items aren't of great quality."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Spam,charged for items never received. Cheap poor quality clothing all from China. Logistics & delivery are a joke.Sending multiple packages from different warehouses and time, APP made it extremely difficult to track/return items from one order. You need to return all items from one package together so you are not charge for return. System are poorly designed and can't identify what items are from which order or did not shown up for you to choose as return items when they are eligible to."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The items are okay. Really have to read the description and look at all the reviews. Sometimes items are not the material type you would think they are. Otherwise the items are usually okay. My main issue is delivery. I paid for express delivery and it's well passed the expected delivery date now, the order still hasn't arrived. Why bother charging for express if it's going to take the same amount of time as regular post. Please use more reliable express delivery method."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love this app but now I don't , after the update it sucks, limiting the use of points to 30% feels so wrong, the products in shein are cheap yet it's overpriced, SheIn points are the reason why I am using this app, but since it is already limited I don't think I will use this app anymore. 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I would just browse through all the items that I could add in my cart, and in the end, the price would be worth it. It's a really fun and aesthetic app to browse through, or even purchase room decor! They have customized items and clothing or cheaper versions. Eg. Stylus pen."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Worst customer service ever. I haven't got a refund for my return. May be the return item got stuck somewhere. It's showing the same location for the past few days. I have been trying to contact live support, but it never gets connected. And if i am trying to submit a ticket, i cannot even find one of my return items in the list. It is so frustrating. I wouldn't recommend this app. I would suggest people go to any nearby store."

It's a 6$ item, but I paid for it, and I want it, and they refuse to replace the missing item. they made my other order now have to be picked up from the post even though I had free delivery to my door. I'm appalled at how I've been treated. I'm done with shein and be warned they will rip u off."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Update: I am disappointed since the latest update doesn't allow Puerto Rico to buy items from the marketplaces. There's a message that says: ""only Shein store items can be shipped to your area, please remove items from other stores."" The products are of good quality or at least good for the price. Shipping is fair and in a timely manner; it also, have many offers, love the fact that I could accumulate points easily for discounts and there are sales often."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love shein the only thing is the games to win take alot longer to win points and makes it harder to win anything by the time we could win something the day we could get it gets expired temu is a lot easier and I've won 9 times
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Even with my minimal email selection I'm vommitted on with a ridiculous amount of constant annoying emails throughout the day every day, consider deleting the app"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Shame on this App! I tried many times to verify using the phone number but it didn't work! Please fix this immediately!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Perfect place to buy stuff from they half of the cheapest and the most coolest items. It does take a while to get to your house, but it's totally worth it."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,would love to be able to insert measuremets of the piece of clothing in mind (within a specific category) and the app just generates all the options
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like this app it's for people who are on a budget, and that cute clothes and accessories the clothing sizes are crazy you gotta look at the reviews to know what size to get that's only problem I have with shein"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Well I've shoped with shein for a long time now and there item,s are not disappointing ,I've never had to send any parsils back ,the items are lovely,I would recommend shein ,to every one 😄"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Theres a feature where u can do a daily poll and do some ez activities to gain points. Theyre ""meant"" to lower your cost of what your buying. But when I go n place an order, the points dont show up or do ANYTHING. If ur a person who likes to buy jewelry from this place but u want it to be good quality, dont buy from Shein. It gets brass and turns colour. Also be aware from products that have suspicious reviews cus some can be fake and click bait; literally trying to make u buy anything u see🤦🏽"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am trying to find a dress a looked at on December so I go on recently viewed but everytime I scroll down the app just freezes, what's the point to keep history search if I cannot see them 😒😒"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Fantastic clothes and the price is reasonable you can get different options and styles from children to adults.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This used to be my favorite shopping app because they offer up to 70%off using points, along with free shipping. But now it sucks, the price is very unreasonable without the points discount compare to other shopping app"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,HORRIBLE! This app was good untill I logged in again and I had 0 points!!! I had 630 points yesterday and they just disappeared! I wrote to customer support in the app and nothing!!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,it's hard to get the 5k annoying grrrrrr always reach the limit assist even if no one has been helped yet. Not recommended back to shopee nalang ulit akoo
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"SHEIN is starting to get expensive 😶, and sometimes there games aren't actuate, it's like they don't want you to win, plus they removed the best games and left the unwanted ones"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Haven't used yet. Been on Temu. Bought to cut ties because half the electronics be breaking. Heard this site the same. So there are probably reasonable items here.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I don't think anyone noticed but I did because things seemed off. It charges you way more for your cart than it adds up to be. My cart added up to be 84 dollars and plus tax it was 95. But before adding tax it said at the bottom my cart was 109 dollars and after tax 111, it added 25 dollars to my actual total. Making me pay for more than the cost of my items. I don't not recommend it it's just that shein is totally ripping you off, and charges way more now than it did a year or two ago"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Awesome, mainly because I get my work cut out for me ...being a mother alone is hard work ,but going to the mall , shopping for 3 kids is very hard Nd stressful, so having this app shein ,is a God sent app I only do grocery shopping now ..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great app! Advice to others: turn off SHEIN's notifications on your devices otherwise you'll be bombarded with notifications every other few SECONDS !
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Shein has cheap, affordable clothes. It's convenient, don't get me wrong. But I ordered something over a month ago. It's been in transit since August 26 and was said to be delivered September 2-4. It's now October 5th and I have not been able to cancel my order or receive assistance. I will be deleting this app. Besides, fast fashion is taking away from one's individual style anyway, and don't get me started on the consumerism."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Again with your daily check in. Your update sucks with giving coins then now it reverts back to zero days? When I've been checking in for the last 2 weeks and haven't missed a day.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Shein is a really good app has a lot of products clothing and anything you will need in it has a very good pricing And quarterly I recommend this app to everyone Around the world shein
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I had a delivery today which was cancelled by myself on the same day,I would like to closed my account please.thankyou. The agent asked me if she was helpful to me and confirmedthat I don't need it,that the reason."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,They scammed me. Didn't sent my parcel and declared that it's been delivered. I have also contacted to customer service but its been 24 days there is no response. Shein is the worst platform. Don't waste your time and money here.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's great I love it but upset I've lost out on game clicks from people due to glitching and it has not been taken care of at all it's been going on for almost a week
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's nice this app but I don't want scam and for that you all can have problems with some people because you all take money and The order will not come...
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Y'all need to fix y'all app. Because I'm playing the 5 free gifts game but I won 10 free gifts but it's not letting me claim any of it. It keeps saying failed to response data. And I don't have very much time left.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a very great shopping add better then temu. Clothes are supper good gadgets are good but just don't buy the back packs 😬
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Please don't give me a popup every single time I add something to my wishlist. It makes the app unusable.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Shipping costs too much then stuff i buy from shein.. Buy set ring at $1.. Shipping costs $25.. Pooor will delete shein..and no option for free shipping
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to order from shein all the time without issue, but in September, I placed an ordered and it took a month before they told me it was undeliverable. It's now November, and I still haven't received my refund. The chat bot they have for customer service is not as helpful as I would like, and it's impossible to find out the status of my refund or talk to an actual person."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely appalling customer service. I ordered a 16 piece cutlery set and received 4tbsp, 4tsp, 4 forks and 0 knives. Shein refuse to acknowledge the missing items, outer shipping packaging was not damaged, therefore cannot be lost in transit."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Not pleased on the new update. Could have sustained the face especially on the check ins tab.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Disgusting! They have this event that will give you 5k coins or credits if you share and invite your friends using your referral code. Done this and invite my friends multiple times but it keeps telling you to invite 1 more to earn the 5k reward. But it still does not give you the reward after following all the instructions. Stop this BS Shein!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Amazing!! SUPER cheap and super cute items. I love this app sm bc when I go to other clothing/item stores it's so pricy bht it's not at shein
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"App is still great for shopping but items became expensive, coupons are lesser compared to before, and points system is awful."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It is very good and cheap! The clothes are also very good quality and wash well! Sometimes I can't find EXACTLY what I'm looking for but there is alot of variety. Also the shipping can take a veryyy long time to come and its quite annoying. Overall great app highly recommend 😊
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I like shein but i notice there is something happen everytime i check in i thought my point will be rising but they reduce it. I hope it could be back the old shein .

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My mom recently bought from here and let me tell you she is very disappointed it's cheap bc the fabric on there is pretty bad and the clothes doesn't match with the pictures on there
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Just started and puppy game keeps crashing customer support is worthless I had no choice I had to click one star but I didn't want to
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Point system is awful now and lies about the points you recieve for example yesterday it said 40 points but when i clicked it to go onto my points balance i only got 1 point. What a joke i spend so much money on shein just to be lied to.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My experience with SHEIN has been great. I love the joint package deal. I got all my stuff at once, and I love it"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best app for shopping hands down. Excellent service, quality and it's well worth it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Some of the photos of the models are a bit too sexual or revealing. It does have some good items tho so 2 stars
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I shared 25 friends on line acc and messenger app, but I can't get free gift, how can we get free gift on this month. This is so annoying and my time is wasted."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Shein is scam app, recently they ask me to collect five gift by sharing shein to my contacts on all my social media platforms. Which I did everything they asked and all my friends downloaded Shein. I was on 07 and two of my family members that doesn't have shein before downloaded and they didn't count them. They lied."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Good quality.Quick and very good service.Always get package within 2 weeks. Buffalo services always friendly and keeps you updated
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like the app. Looking forward to ordering. First time on your app. Hopefully, your everything advertised."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Once you order there is no way of contacting anyone. Waiting for my order 3 weeks and no sign of it. No details about delivery at all and no one to ask, only generic BOT replies."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"You can't use all of your points now, I love shopping on shein because you can earn big discount with points, but now I can't use all of the points :("
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"daily chekins is very slow, bring back the old daily check-in. and also the free shipping and the minimum spend and the the points we can use is also limited"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"very disappointing, with their recent event. Obviously they just wanted to have more downloads however as soon as you're near completion they will till you the event is no longer available"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I chose English language in the settings and it's still showing me everything in Spanish. Practically useless.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"UPDATE: STOP USING CANADA POST, SLOWEST SHIPPING OF THE 3 OPTIONS AVAILABLE!!!! Faster shipping equals, faster repurchasing! After 30+ orders you would think you wouldn't have to pay an extra ($1.99) to replace your order if it doesn't arrive...that should be a bonus for being a loyal customer. Along with quicker shipping through FedEx or UNI (1week) rather than snail mail Canada Post (2weeks or LONGER). Most items are decent quality at great prices."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Fantastic appealing designs of clothing for excellent people, please keep up the greatest company expectations, as you will, and have been, I am wishing encouragement."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Pictures look great. Actual merchandise is nothing like the photo.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It says they delivered your item but you haven't received anything. And you can't even contact customer service because it's only a robot chat. So this s ripoff
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's not awful, don't get me wrong. Affordable items and such are great. But the rewards and games are all scams. They don't allow you to win anything high of value. No matter how many times you do it, you won't get a high value reward. I have done it over and over again to test it, but nothing. The app is good, but don't expect rewards for the games."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Stop scrolling me to the bottom of the page after I add something to my cart. That is so annoying.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Quality can be ok what do you expect. Cheap as chips does not get quality. But if disposable stuff is what you want then this is it
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"By far, one of the best shopping apps! More pricey than AliExpress but better options and materials. Great cosmetic products and beautiful clothing"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Honestly the prices in the basket change, they only let the Americans play mini games and share some codes like how's that fair? When you order the updater on where your Package is doesn't always update."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Worst app to try and do a return on. Spam galore!Will pop up in every social media platform you have.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I try to play the invites to get a 5k reward coupon and after a few invites they shut down my account and prohibit me to play the game. IT'S A SCAM WASTE OF EFFORTS ☹️

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app no longer gives access. I updated again so I have the latest app and I still have no access. It says that something is wrong with your server also another brief pop at the bottom with a long exception about Route exception: ssl handshake exception: Chain validation failed Please fix. I can no longer use the app to gain my daily check in points or to browse catalog to possibly buy anything.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,50/50 most items are really good quality but most of the time there hit or misses.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,You can get fashionable clothes and other households and more for affordable prices and it's useful for all ages!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Okay so I love shein but once you start messing with my points that's where I draw the line. I have been checking in to shein every single day and for some reason the points ""expire"" I don't know why you would give the points to me and then have them expire the next day.This needs to be fixed or I'm gonna feel like I'm just waisting my damn time."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The shipping price isn't necessary in my attention. The popups on free thing are just as annoying on Temu.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,most the 1 star reviews are definitely bots cause I've never had an issue with shein they're a great app like every app charges tax for delivery fee
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,They are not easy app to use and the free gifts they say to refer people to get it and they never do what they say so you never get anything. Horrible app
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,For the first time i ordered 10 items almost two month not yet received my ordered....if i knew like that i'd never install app and ordered ...wasted my time
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,They wont let you use your points anymore From 70% to just 30% LOL redeeming points is useless I may not order again. Been ordering since 2021 and now farewell
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Awesome deals, low prices, delivery is great, you can find anything you want or need 👍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've bought so much from here and have been pleased. However, they have started allowing ""marketplace"" sellers, which 9/10 times is junk. Over half of my last order was broken when I received it, and the common denominator was that they were marketplace items. And they don't allow returns on those items, imagine that. I've gotten things from ""marketplace"" that look NOTHING like the pictures. I wish we could report those sellers."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I think everything is wonder full it's just a bit expensive and takes long time other than that it's good and I love !!! It
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It is really good when you find clothes you want and order them but always get the wrong size when I order my things
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is horrible. Sure they have cute clothes and it's affordable. But Google this app. It's absolutely horrible how they treat their costumers. It is very likely that they hire kids and put them under unsafe working conditions. It's also shown that they work 18 hours everyday with little breaks. They get 1 day off in an entire month. They also get paid around 4 cents a clothing piece. If you use this app, your supporting this horrible behaviour. Please think twice before using this app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I placed my order, and yet it was not shipped the moment i used my coupon and points all together. So dissapointing. It always says in transit but the local courier says they did not recieve any parcel from shein. I would also like to add please give your costumer the option to choose what courier they would like to have. I hopen you'll consider this until the it stays 2 stars."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It's an okay app. The items are great can be hit and miss but that's the risk with cheaper items. It's just a shame about the free games. Never works always conveniently glitches on the last one and you get nothing. Apart from that it's a good app
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I go on temu more than here but I think they are both very similar and have a lot of the same clothes. Prices are roughly the same too, it's a good app I just actually haven't bought anything from here as I downloaded temu first and always have free delivery 😀 I think you have to spend a certain amount before you get free delivery on shein"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,it takes weeks to get your orders... it shouldn't take 2 weeks for a couple of pictures & a couple other household items. yes shein has alot of options but the delivery part is absolutely horrible! they need to reimburse the order or something bc this happens to alot of ppl. shein needs to have better obligations to their customers! AS OF RIGHT NOW I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS SITE! I have to pay double shipping bc the items were supposed to be delivered before Christmas but its 1week later & waitin
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,EVERY single time I log in it makes me reset my password because of 'strange activity' on my account which is literally just me trying to log in. And the complaints form is utterly unusable. 3 topics to complain about and asks for a mandatory service ID that doesn't even have anything in the drop box to choose from.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm a bargain shopper!! I also am conscience of ; you get what you pay for. So keeping that in mind.... I have gotten some really cute items from here, stuff from kitchen gadgets to socks, lounge pants, joggers, hoodies the list goes on and on!!! Maybe one time I got something that was irregular. I made some alterations and it was better than ever! Some people complain on the shipping times, I have always gotten my orders around two weeks. They keep you posted on your delivery date."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm reporting a potential scam. I get several notifications from Shein App daily. I tapped on same notification and it brought to pick up to 10 free items. There was ""X"" tab to tap on to indicate it was a pop up, so after selecting the items, it brought me to share with my friends and friend said it was scam. Can you please review this? I had to back out the app to be brought the regular homepage because kept coming up. Please investigate."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I had a bad experience with Shein. They delivered wrong package. I informed and after confirmation, they want me to self return the package at my own expense before they can deliver the correct order. It was their default to deliver entire wrong package and now I have to pay for the cost of returning it back??? Where is justice there?? I suggested to deliver my correct order and I will hand over the wrong package upon delivery.The costumer service refuse my suggestion.What a disaster experience."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love this app. But now I don't like it anymore. Before it offers great deals, and its possible to use generous amounts of points in every checkout. Now, it only limits 30% and I can't even use coupons or referals! So many restrictions, I hate it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"They offer you free gifts then give you points you have to earn to get those gifts, you invite people to join to get points and when you get enough they increase the amount you need after going through all that hassle, so they'll scam you out of so called ""perks"" of Shein. Have cool stuff but how they go about their perks the whole app might not be legit."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,worst online shop ever when you order packages are so slow to be delivered and they get lost in the way and it is very hard to get the money back . I really don't care if they get lost but please when they get lost the money must be given to us quickly.. WORST CUSTOMERS CARE EVER
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have a great experience so far ..all my stuff was delivered in perfect condition and the time was great ..however l don't know how to get my money back after l double paid for the same purchase. ...
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It is really hard to get into. You except an invitation to spin and immediately it goes to the web page not letting you spin to win anything. If it's another like Temu and you never win what they say you can win then I don't want it. I am tired of working hard and it getting the prizes promised instead like Temu they start adding more products that you have to earn to get. So it's not free c you work to get it then when one dollar away it takes so much then they only let you win fifty cents.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have never really had the chance to say this. But truly speaking I get so happy whenever I shop on Shein, in fact I prefer to shop online lately, with their vast fashion choices, size description and helpful reviews. I have managed to get amazing pieces. Not to mention the shipping is always free when I purchase. Right now I'm awaiting two separate packages...I'm so excited!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great prices for most of the items on SHEIN. I absolutely love the makeup products. The clothing is fine. So if anyone is interested in getting this app, you definitely should. There are way more cheaper items on this app then Sephora and Ulta."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Ok app, but its very annoying that you cant filter the ratings on size and color anymore. It used to be easy to determine how an item would fit you. Now u have to scrol through a lot of pics hoping to find someone in your size with almost your build."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I love shopping with SheIn especially for My daughters and I to have matching outfits I just love it...................
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Best products but now I hate shein. The points that can be used before was up to 70% of the price of a product now it's down to 30% I saved points so I can buy the product that I really want to buy and now that I've saved enough points I can use the 30% points of the product I want.Ahhhh!. If the old SheIn points discount doesn't come back I'll be going back to other shopping sites sorry. Without the points your products are far very expensive...Shein points make Shein special for me. And now...

Zero communication with actual people and zero kept promises! Charged the regular price too and I got a whoppin 5 bucks in shein points to apologize for the massive delay. Not being petty but damn. The quality is ok but the fact that you're forced to talk to a chatbot and never allowed to talk to a real person was hard and wrong on so many levels!! Never again!

It's much more cheaper if I buy from Shoppe or Lazada. No frequent ""free shipping with no minimum spent"" vouchers too. Their shipping free is expensive. The app is not that convenient or useful anymore. Maybe I will stop buying from this app because the changes are disappointing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been using this app for a long time and never had an issue. I made a recent order and paid for express shipping cause the item in the order.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Apps fine, changes too often usually making it harder to find what you're looking for. Clothes are cheap but a wealth of sizes and prices that usually match the value make it worthwhile. My main issue is that the app sends notifications way too often. It's clothing, I don't buy daily."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Ordered a few items off this site. Couple of hundreds worth. It's all junk. Poor quality clothes. Poor quality bedding. I could stick better with my eyes closed. They take a nice picture and send you junk. Reminds me of the big Mac on the bus stops. Picture looks good but not what you get. Don't be a mug like me and don't get sucked in. It's cheap for a reason. The reason is it's fit for the bin. Can't be bothered with trying to get a refund. More hassle than needed.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's fun to weekly apply for testing products. I've never won. I'm assuming it is few and extremely far between. The app has something cool for all ages and stages of life all genders. It's simply lovely and the shipping is quick. The funnest and most reasonably priced shopping app I've ever used! Thanks SHEIN!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"it's pretty good. You can find fashionable cute outfits for a really cheap price but the problem is the quality.

Also, the clothes would be always super thin And I also wanna say that every time I order a cute clothes and see my size it's 10x bigger than it looks like.

It's disappointing when I find something I'm in love with but it's not made in larger sizes. I bought a pair of wide leg pants that I was very happy with but I did have to buy a size 28-30. The sizing is a bit off. Remember too; big girls like pretty maxi dresses too. Nice flowing ones with no multiple ruffles down to the groundSome of us don't Iike our legs showing. I am happy I found a few curve sizes for me though.🙂

Some of the material I'm not too crazy about and for me, they are too short. While I love the variety of sizes....they need to add lengths. But I will always purchase from them. I purchased my entire wedding party's attire from Shein including my dress and my husband's suit. The bridesmaids dresses were beautiful. They were made of beautiful satin material."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Worstttttt app. Not true to size. And there is no exchanging option . And if you want to return the product you have to go by yourself and submit them in your nearby location. Very cheap. And they think they are billgates. Not treating customers in a good way. Go and learn from Indian online shopping apps.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is easy to use. So many things in the app you can buy and the materials are so gud of course you need to buy something that is gonna fit your image is easy to order things that are not gonna go with your body .Never mind the model choose models your size or close to your size. Measure your body and those models close to your body size. Shein improve everytime and there is alwaysa discount.I love the fact that I don't have to wait long ques trying to find what I love it saves you time !!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I've bought several items and the track status says it was dropped off but I never received my items. Customer service is just AI and won't give me an appropriate answer. Won't be buying anything else from here from now on. Thank you for nothing. Ps. I did not have a good shopping experience and your AI support doesn't not give me any correct answers or solutions. Why can't I speak to a human or have a contact number/email?

No customer support but just a bot. So be aware. That was my first and last purchase. PS: Unfortunately that option does not work as it is just a bot, so do not make an impression."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein honestly has never done me wrong. I've had a few orders that were $200+ all my orders came with 2-3 weeks, packaged and without issues to them. Shein has VERY good quality items for cheap. My only issue has been with shoes. I've only gotten sneakers/sandals. Sandals are fine, but the sneakers are not cushioned well for feet. A day out with the sneakers on will have my feet in agony by the time I'm on the way home. Other than that, read reviews, really search for what you want, profit."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I liked some of the stuff I ordered from this shopping app which was a couple of shirts and a sweatshirt but I was disappointed in the material they used for the sweatshirt I ordered. It was made out cheap material, it doesn't feel like regular sweatshirt material! Next time I order from Shein. I'll pay closer attention to the material they have listed in the description. But the other two shirts that I bought are nice but not the material I'd hope for."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really like app, cheap, most of the times good quality but around the holidays the delivery is way too slow, I ordered Christmas presents on the 6th and they still haven't come, the were supposed to get here around the 18th, I started to press ""Urgent Delivery"" but as I can see nothing is changing.

I've been told it has a sticker on it & it has been shipped, I got a UPS tracking order. When I contacted UPS the told me it never shipped, Shien is telling me it shipped.

I invited one of my friends to get SHEIN to help me get the coupon and credit, and she is a new player, but when I tried to finish it, it suspected me of cheating, so I can't even get it. Please fix this soon, I wanna get tres reyes presents for my family 🙏🏼"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app. There are no things wrong with it, and there is this thing called ""Wishlist,"" where you can add as many items that you want later. I have already bought tons of stuff from them, and they all came out perfect! I just think they should add more demon slayer merch/ anime shows stuff, though."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is literally the only app that takes too long to get delivered. You have to wait for like 2 weeks and more like is this a joke?! They don't even fix it and when I tried reaching the customer service they just tell you nonsense and they're not helping at all. I have an order that it's stuck up in the transit and I need it ASAP on Dec.21 and until now, they don't help and there's no update in the shipping status👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I recently ordered a high heels from Shein but received totally different product. I received some cheap product which is not even a high heels. It was said non returnable and when i raised a complaint through the so called customer service ""chat"" i got a link to reorder. I reodered the product but nothing happend after that till today i didn't receive the product or any updates. I feel really cheated by Shein. I never expected this."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I'm disppointed as this is the first time I've encountered for not receiving my package when it say its been delivered. I've been a shein member for a long time and so far this is the first time and worst expeience about this telling them and they won't refund me🤬😤 I kept inquiring about it but it says no refund due for their policy when I've been waiting and telling this for a long time and its been a month and few weeks now. My order didn't refund nor received it. 🤬 I'm deleting it!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Shein used to be my go to, the measurements are accurate, it offers a range and variety of clothing for any style. I usually check the reviews to check the quality of the material because it's not always the same as shown in their pictures. The tax and delivery fee were reasonable, lately it's just ridiculous!! I bought items worth R1400 and I had to pay R800,its insane considering I used to pay around R200/R300. There are missing items from your parcel also and no way to retrieve them. Robbery!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been trying to collect daily points however, after clicking ""Go check in"" the screen justs turn white and I keep waiting yet, nothing's happening. I lost track of my points 'cause it's not working for a week now. 😢 Can you please not ask me to call your customer service hotline. Just give me an answer why is this happening."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The app is easy to work. I never have any issues with it and I LOVE SHEIN!!! I've never had any issues with Shein and I've liked almost everything I've ordered!!! No problems with the app tho!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Would be great if I could actually get my orders! Very first order was split into 2 packages. First package came in a week, was actually surprised. Second package, I waited a month with about 5 interactions with shein and them telling me it's coming, just taking longer than usual. Package never came, week later they finally said package was lost but they did refund me promptly. Gave them another chance, this time it was nothing I even ordered. Very disappointed, going back to TEMU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Well I am very disappointed. I haven't ordered from shein in while. I decided to check them out and it throwed the gems, spins, refer a new app user and receive 300 150 in credit and 150 in coupons. I did my part they didn't. I hate a liar.I love the prices. I have ordered many bathing suits and tried a couple on they fit great. They have such great sales. I started off shopping with shein buying glow in dark stars so they have a little of everything and I love them."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The wait is just too long. My order was supposed to arrive 11th March and I'm still waiting for it while it's already March 16. I have a feeling this is a scam. And I already paid for it >:(
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Their shipping is slow and awful and usually late. The items will sit in one spot for 2 weeks then maybe get to ya after the due date and after they tell you it's been delayed. Prices are good. But not worth the wait!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Scam! I checked in for 6 days straight and on the 7th day, the day I would have received extra pts, I was reset to day 1. And all they did was tell me I was confused about the policy and rules, which btw state that I should have still been on day 7. And I have screenshots to prove they are committing fraud by resetting your checkin tally and scamming you out of pts (i.e. money)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,From shein side not bad at all.....but the logistic company doesn't keep us informed with tracking details that we can understand

And also the points I've been saving wont apply to the item, its so laggy and always says timeout. So frustrating, worst shopping app I've ever used. SCAMMERS!! Edit: the worst thing in this app is the 30% discount of points are uselesss. so don't ever download this app, I'm telling you..... bring back 70 percent off in points!!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The thing I love the most that keeps me coming back is the reviews. I get to see the clothes on people built like me and I can confidently make my purchase knowing I'm probably gonna love it. There's always a risk online shopping but this cuts that down significantly.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love SHEIN! I am constantly buy from the app and have not had a problem yet. 🖤

Have loads of trendy options such as Y2K or minimalistic clothing. I'm not sure if this was a coincidence or not but I had previously requested to have more trendy clothing in the teen girls section on their insta, soon enough, it happened!. But anywho, shien>>>>"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Shein may have low cost options. But you get what you pay for, I recently fell for one of their ""Free game/freebies, got people to click the link, despite it looking like you've been hacked, and still didn't receive my free gifts. Which is super scammy. I may use the app for nails and eyelashes, but I won't fall for that again. Got me out here looking scammy"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like this app - I have been pretty pleased with my purchases, the quality, and the choices. The prices are comoarable to Amazon/Walmart/Target. However, the in-app game play is a joke. If you participate in the in-app games in an attempt to win any rewards, you will get close to winning and then have to invite a ton of people who have never downloaded the app before. I think spamming my friends and family to finish winning a game is absurd."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I do love to shop here. They got the best products here. But please do me a favor. Please stop putting them in tore up boxes. It's annoying!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This online store is a scam claims my order was delivered by FedEx I contacted FedEx they claim the driver placed it under the doormat I was in my apartment a driver didn't even knock and now I can't request a refund for my stolen items so not use this site they keep your money and have poor judgement on who they have deliver your items I also paid for express shipping as the order was for someone's birthday thanks for taking my last and ruining the gifts I purchased. DO NOT USE THIS SITE

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I get this at 2because of how they run their app. They've got some good stuff but half of them are. But my main issue is how they keep adding the money up wrong. They tack on money and don't explain to you why it's all of a sudden that price. As well as they give you a points that you can earn, and if you don't use them when they say to use them they take them away."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Too many ads and it's very disruptive.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Haven't ordered anything from there yet but I like it so far Edit: one of the games I played said it detected suspicious activity however I did not do anything against the rules please fix that bug, also I did place an order and I will update once I receive it.

I've done everything asked of me and then some, and still no resolve. Orders that WERE ACTUAL FRAUD have been shipped but mine isn't because it seems suspicious? I'm getting so frustrated at this point and I dont know why this can't be fixed already. This is my second attempt at this order for these items and I need them to be sent out."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Like home, wish or Temy app... all the same, looks like there is cheap things but then you pay for the delivery or its not the price that you saw at first or the price doesn't match with the picture product.... ah take ages to deliver, says 7 to 10 business days but its 15 minimum if you are lucky Robotic costumers service 😠. Pay more but, faster deliver and better quality with a good costumers service at amzn."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When I want to order, the prices are higher than they are, then when I want to click on delivery, it shows me fast shipping, and I do not want fast shipping. Please solve this problem because it is considered a scam."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Most items no longer available for discount coupons. Used to be good pricing due to coupons now not worth shopping. App is unstable. Keeps removing items from basket but not adding to out of stock list so can't keep track of what I was going to purchase. Makes me not want to shop on the app
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This is more of a help question than review, but I let my friend on my shein to buy a gift for herself, and she deleted my account completely. Which I didn't care to much about cause I thought I could just reusee the email and make a new account but I can't, and I can't ho to their help centre either because I don't have an account, if shein can see this and help I'd be very thankful."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Shein went from Shein to Sh**. Pay close attention to your checkout totals because they will change going back & forth in your cart. Also, you won't be able to view your PayPal account options if you go to pay w/PayPal. Discounts apparently are a thing of the past for them as it seems the max discount can go up to $16 on the largest of orders. Your coupons are trash. Way to go Shein. TEMU and Amazon for me at this point. Oh, and TEMU has customer service that can talk to you on the phone ..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Some of the clothes don't look like the style in the pictures shown of them when you receive them the neckline is different or the length of the hemline on some dresses and pants.(even with taking measurements before buying. ) most of the things I bought fit alright tho.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am very satisfied with this app. The shipping was faster than I expected, less than they specified. There is a large variety of products, the items that I purchased have a very good quality, but one should always check the reviews and the size. I will definitely buy again, the prices are also ok."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app socks. Ever since I won the first prize its been saying bad connection. I'm done with it. I'm only giving it a star to get off here
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,You better hope your order doesn't get lost because you can't get a hold of anyone to get a refund. especially when they deliver your order to a completely different state than what was on the site as your delivery address. It just says delivered even though it was not and delivered wrong.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Spyware. Interface attempts to purchase items on your behalf without permission.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Bunch of theives , first order came missing around 60$ worth of items and no one will answer the emails."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"While products are good, service is pathetic. They take ages to get the product delivered. If you want to return, they will actually charge a pickup fee to before refunding the amount. And refund takes ages again even if you have opted for the wallet method. So thank you. But never ordering from shein again! Other service providers are much better and much more customer friendly. Also, they maintain a degree of transparency, where again shein fails."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This has been the only app I've been using for clothes shopping for the past year and a half. It has relatively low prices for clothes just as good anywhere else IF you make sure you look through the reviews thoroughly, especially the pictures. My only bad experience with a purchase was a few loose strings on a shirt and a bag that makes a hell lot of a noise with A LOT of loose strings. Other than that - ~90% of my purchases have been perfect (even my prom dress :3 )"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app gives you really great options but the customer service sucks. I don't think the management really cares about anything once the goods are dispatched. The customer support contact number keeps ringing with nobody to take the call. The delivery partner is the worst of the lot. Had two packages to be delivered at the same address, even after the status showing as out for delivery, didn't receive the parcel. however, package with a later delivery date was received In time."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Pros: Huge selection with new items coming out every day, great prices, I love everything I've bought and I'm always excited to order more, discount codes, lots of fashion variety, and I can wear the styles I want at a fraction of the cost. Cons: I can spend hours just browsing through this app and the temptation to purchase everything on my wishlist is way too high."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the variety and reasonable pricing. So far all the clothes and even electronics have been great quality. My only issues are the tracking and the customer service features. I just received an order but I was never shown an email that said it shipped It still shows ""processing"" in the app. And when I tried to ask for help I didn't really get a solution and was redirected back into the app to square one."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great range of fashionable clothing. Luck of the draw when it comes to quality/ fit. Expect to get what you pay for. Also, returns are unnecessarily complicated by having to provide three photos per item you want to return (why??), then having to choose your return method and printing the label yourself. I'd prefer filling out a return slip and stick an already provided return sticker on the parcel. That's just me, though..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"App is fairly clear, but it's hard to search everything at once, they want you to look at particular collections so they hide things. Items are very cheap, but take a long time to arrive and about half the time are so low quality they're unuseable, and while returns are potentially possible they're so awkward that it's really not worth it. Shoes in particular seem to be a definite ""must avoid"", no cheaper than elsewhere and many times less well made. Good for underwear and slinky summer clothes."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's decent, nice and engaging scrolling through all the items. A lot of notifications (although I'm sure there is a setting that can change that) and a few items that are the exact same at different prices so keep your eyes out for that.. I just REALLY WISH there was the option to collaborate on a board with another app user... Would make outfit planning for shoots/trips etc so much easier! 👀"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The clothes desing are pretty and they got pretty cheap stuff, but you only get free shippings on orders over 50$. So if you want to buy something that costs 3$, you have to pay 14.99 for shipping. Basically whatever discount you got for the item, you end up paying in shipping. You can look for free shipping codes but only one works and you can use it once. Unless you stick to their potcast and the give a free shipping code."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Love just about everything about Shein. One of the only problems I have is that the site advertises free returns, but the first return is the only one free. Every one after that they take off around 8-10 dollars for every box. Plus, you can't combine different orders in the same box. I had multiple orders and a few items from each that didn't fit, so I wanted to combine them to just have one return and get it free. But, I couldn't do that, so I had multiple returns and money taken off. Very sad"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Super easy to use! Product quality range from okay to excellent. Clothing includes sizes as measurements instead of usual S/M/L. Very wide range in selection, especially for us curvy girls! Makeup is 10/10 - I don't think I'll be buying makeup anywhere else. Shipping can take a while, but spend enough and it's free express but have never used it. Returns are ridiculously easy. Have never had an issue with the app crashing. HIGHLY recommend!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The app makes shopping online convenient. I have a disability and no immune system so for me online is best for my circumstances. I've had nightmares.in the past. Most times are a hit. The odd one is off if it's a design just not great for my body type. It's more often than not true to size. I love that there is the measurements. And their point system encourages people to load photos. Makes reviewing the right choice to buy so much easier. Smart marketing for sure. If helps the customer out.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Never had a problem shopping with or returning items with shein. I just make sure i look at the reviews for sizing to make sure I get the correct fit. Love the points reward system. (Even though there is a time limit to them to which I didn't know so lost loads of points.) 🤣 But that was purely my fault. You wait around 10 days for delivery which isn't bad and I've never had a problem with quality for the price. It's great. 👍
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"DO NOT BUY thinking that its easy to return or exchange. After being not satisfied with the size of the cloth received , i tried exchanging for a smaller size. But they dont have a exchange policy. So i would have to pay shipping fee and then repurchase and reship product (the price has already gone up). Also, if i want to return 2 items at once.. for each one of them i would have to pay shipping fee seperately. There is no option to add another item with the other return items."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"On a tight budget but still want to stay trendy? You might not shop anywhere else again! I am seriously addicted to this app, the choices are ENDLESS, and there's something for everyone's style, including style for the entire family - all at super reasonable prices. The app is visually appealing, if not a bit busy (due to all the many items in stock) but easy to navigate. The ONLY thing I would say is that the quality of the pieces are not meant to last forever. But that is fast fashion right?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein! I've always recieved my items within the delivery window I've selected and I've never had any issues with returns. They have a great bonus and reward system as well and have always been very friendly when I needed help with an issue. Some may call them ""fast fashion"" but they do sell materials that are sustainable (cotton, wool,etc). They are a great way to try trends without spending a fortune. ** My only complaint is I wish they had more 9.5/narrow shoe options.**"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I had very good experience with shein. You really need to pay attention to the sizes underneath then they tell you (preference inches or cm) of each size. Also reviews are helpful to get an idea of the material, size, fit, comfort. Not everything is a deal, sometimes you will see things that you can get at other places for cheaper but other than that I would recommend the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love shopping at Shein But there is a few things ...like when you want to change a coupon or change something on your order, once you go to the payment tab, theres no going back to change anything. You have to cancel the entire order and restart! I also returned an item and it's yet to be refunded! Lastly, theres no way to communicate other than sending a ticket , email, or chat system (which they go offline often) and I've tried calling as well but all I get is dial tone.👎"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Honestly great. A lot of these sights suck.. takes over a month to ship, you get the wrong items, things are missing or don't look the way they did in the picture... not shein. Ships in about 2 weeks, app is easy to use, always saves my wishlists, orders show up with everything in it, and my favorite part - all the reviews and pictures help SO much. New favorite online store. And did I mention it's CHEAP"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This site/app constantly has new discounted items. They have a lot of ways to earn points that equal into cents (1 point = 1 cent of a purchase) and they add up pretty quickly. The items are not always made correctly, a lot gets passed quality control but they make it really easy to return and get refunds on most items. I have a had a defective non-returnable item but it was whatever since it was so cheap to begin with. I just donated that. So be aware, but it's so cheap it may not matter."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The Shein App is totally appealing...clear, colourful and easy to navigate. The different stages, from browsing to ordering, on to dispatch and tracking, are easy to access, and clearly laid out. Every item is beautifully photographed, and well-described, often with customer reviews which add that ""personal touch"" and make it even more relatable, and can help you to make your choice. There are rewards available via a points system for adding your own contributions. What more can you ask for!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great App for finding cute clothes at a super low price, although it is still a 'Fast-Fashion' brand which is a negative. Shipping times are also relatively long, it took 4 weeks to recieve one item I had purchased. One of my favorites things about this app is the ability to earn points by playing games and completing certain activities within the app, if you are consistent you can eventually win enough points that you can then use during checkout to take more than 70% off of your order!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app itself is good and runs with minimal glitches. The selection is pretty good accross the board for all sizes, and even across genders though it is primarily for female or femme presenting tbh. You do get what you pay for though, be warned. The more expensive stuff is actually worth the price tho, so it's not a waste. It is also a nice cheap way to try new styles or trends and not having to be too upset if it doesn't work out because it wasn't that much to begin with."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've only made one previous purchase with a second on its way... 1) It would be great if the bra and shoe sizes could be in a comparative chart, as I'm not sure how European, American, South African/English, etc. sizes compare. This makes making a purchase an unpleasant/uneasy experience. 2) An easy to access page on how to return or exchange goods that don't fit will make me feel more comfortable about shopping on Shein and lead to me buying more."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Ive completely changed my whole wardrobe from this online shopping app! So in love with it, but they have really bad return policy so you'll have to be careful with what you buy, you have to pay 3 times more to just get things returned, and its almost a never ending process! other than that it is reliable and amazing styles out there. AND AGAIN, THEY DO TAKE MORE THAN 2 WEEKS TO DELIVER."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's easy to use, has great features such as being able to make boards (which can prove useful for organizing, categorizing and making outfits), and you get points which can make your shopping experience more affordable (when you get enough points). Lastly, the pictures of the product look exactly the same in person, the only issue I've noticed is that sometimes the sizing is a little off (product is at times smaller than the sizing suggests in my experience)."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I love it. I never have any problems. Although it would be pretty cool if there were some way where you could ask customers about products so you can get more info om specific things. But i like it anyway (update): had a problem with an order that was lost by the company (not fedex but the people who actually package it). I emailed twice and looked for any help at all and didnt find anything so... That brings my rating down from 5 to 3 because thats really important.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Decent quality, great prices! I've brought multiple things off shein and they have all been pretty good quality for the cheap prices I've paid. It pays to read through reviews to get more accurate sizing guides. Will definitely continue to shop from shein. The return process is easy, however depending on what you're sending back it's almost not worth paying the return shipping because it costs just as much as some items. But overall, great app - easy to use and great range of stuff."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The app is amazing I have no difficult finding items that I need and you can also collected point that can decrease the amount of money you spend and there are always coupons to lower your cost........ I used to like the layout of the app but now I don't.👎🚫 It look like I'm shopping on aliexpress 😣and it's way harder to find items now.Dislike the Updated version.😩
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love it! Very well designed. The search bar makes it so easy to find exactly what you're looking for, even though there is so much variety in this store. If you search one thing it shows you a whole range of similar things to your search... Love that you can track your order aswell through the app... It reminds me what I've ordered and I can see where it is... EXCELLENT!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Sizing is ridiculous, along with the filtering. The sizing is all over the place and you have to check the sizing of each item, while the filters for ""style"" is basically the same as the ""occasion"" filter. It would better if they remade the ""style"" filter to have it actually tell you the style of the clothing. I have not ordered from there yet, but it seems to have good reviews on the clothes themselves."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the free shipping, I refuse to use the wish app because they charge shipping for each item. SHEIN's products come as they look. The fabric tends to be thinner than the photos look' but for the price I can't complain! Fast shipping. Clothes tend to run a little small so i would recommend buying one size up. But otherwise it's a great way to buy clothes on a budget."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love shein, every thing is soo cheap, there are always discounts and you get coupons and points to reduce the price. It's nice because you can use a coupon and your points instead of having to pick one. Some times there are flash sales when products are only $1! Like full on clothes! Its cool that they have a little section of the app where people have outfits made if shein clothing which gives an idea of how you can wear it. This is nice if you have no idea when it comes to fashion."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"They've never failed me on delivery, customer service, efficiency of returns and refunds. The actual products are very true to the ones pictured. the only problem I have is with sizing. The majority of products, if not all, come from Asian manufacturers. Because of this SIZING IS NOT CONSISTENT between brands; their sizing charts are different and not sufficient to do a good read. This is a real problem for me. I use the reviews to get a gauge. Other than that I'm very happy with Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Someone recommended me this app and... I'm absolutely blown! Couldn't believe the reasonable prices for such beautiful outfits and there's a variety to choose from! Including jewelry!! My first purchase came in fast and the quality is really good. The app's UI is super easy to navigate and love the modern look. Also, love the fact you can gain points by playing games, reviewing...etc. The point system is a great idea. And the deals you can get from them are great! Thanks Shein Team!!! :D"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Horrible customer care service. My sister has ordered multiple times from this app but for the first time is facing difficulty for returning an order.. The app gives an hotline number but there is seriously no one who's gonna pick your call and deal with your problem. You will just be getting a robotic sound that's it. If tired to return it through the app it wont let you to select the ""pick up"" option and the only other option left Is ""self-sending"".. Very upset with the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"They have so many categories (sexy, plus size, modest dress, chic, etc). It's so easy to order and returns are free as long as everything is returned at once, meaning you can't do multiple different return packages. Majority of the clothes are good quality. And you can easily see real reviews to see how the clothes look on non-models, which is the most important thing!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"One of the most well designed apps I've seen, very easy to use and with many features built in to make your shopping easier. Wishlists are intuitive and always being improved upon, while the basket lets you know if an item is running low in stock, checkout is fluid, simple and uncomplicated. The app never crashes, and is solid and well maintained, updated regularly. The design is almost too good, lol - you find yourself buying far more than you intended. Clever design ;) Overall, excellent!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I haven't had many issues with my purchases.. the app does give trouble every now and again. I also don't like that sometimes I can have a certain item on sale, then all the sudden, it'll be unavailable or unavailable in select sizes, etc.... I mean come on, most of the time, they end up restocking later on... it's just frustrating. Otherwise, I will continue shopping shein. It's been pretty great."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's does have variety of things which you want and more, it's super awesome site which has edge over other shopping sites. One star less because many times I've seen that the clothes I've ordered does not match the quality as shown in image. And another fact that if you have used coupon and returned the clothes, they cut money which is hard to calculate. But, still I try to select stuff very carefully, so that I don't have to return. 🙂"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great place to find affordable clothes. Found some lovely items, with the measurements being super useful and the customer photos are helpful. The delivery doesn't take as long as people think. the quality varies for each product so would look into each item carefully before purchasing. There's always usually discount codes on the app to save you money. Only thing I dislike is the description of the item is random and not always accurate, which makes it hard to find what you're looking for."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Good stuff to be found here. They sent me some good items for not a lot of money. They also sent me a wrong order but it was probably a fluke. The customer service was extremely friendly and handled the refund well. I have no problem shopping with them at all. Great shopping app, though I wish there was a bit more selection on certain items, that's my only gripe. Super easy and super service for if things turn not so easy. I love this app!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I love the prices and the variety of materials available. Shipping speeds are great. The review writing process is annoying. If you make errors and use predictive text to fix it when youpress the correct word, it keeps the error and adds the new word to the end. Essentially you have to type perfectly each time or retype a lot. Also, you can't review items individually. If I'm ready to review an item not on page one, I have to review those items before it before I can get to the one I want."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The app is easy to navigate. Lots of discounts and lots of pretty options. The clothes are relatively cheap and the quality reflects that. Read the reviews to help determine if the item(s) is/are good quality. Note: Prices have increased recently. Measurements are usually accurate. Ships quickly but transit times are quite lengthy with limited updates. Customer service is hit or miss depending on the issue. Overall a decent app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Many good and not good quality products. Pros: good product compare to its price, loads of selection, return is free where I live, not sure if it's same in all countries. Delivery is fast & can earn points which becomes money to buy stuff. Cons: my setting is in English but most parts are in local language which is annoying. A lot of bad quality products as well, not long lasting. Search engine is bad in English, it shows all kind of random stuff when you search for specific product."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm enjoying every bit of my shopping experiences from this app. The down side of the app is changing price of the items within minutes of adding them to your cart. Take for example, when you find an item for $7 and add it to your cart, and you keep adding other items too so that you can check out multiple items at a goal but only to discover most of the prices of the good changes before you are ready to check out I have this experience more than twice and I keep wondering it the app is a scam."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great Value for fast fashion! Quality of clothing is higher than expected. Not top of the line, of course, but for the price, it can't be beat. Shipping is pretty quick considering it's coming from so far away, and returns are easy, though return shipping is kind of expensive. Be sure to read reviews for accurate size/fit, that's very helpful, and buy 2 different sizes if you're unsure, and since shipping is expensive buy a haul to reduce individual returns."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent app. Items are as shown, and shipping is quick. Coupons also regularly pop up for customers to use. We've bought from Shein several times and are always satisfied with our items. The only things I can think of which need improvement: a) there are a few duplicate listings for the same items, with different prices (so people sometimes end up paying more for the same thing), and b) I can't use super- specific search terms. It ends up excluding certain results. Still highly recommended."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Buffalo delivery service is a scam. Everytime I order there is some issue. Latest scam is lying about attempting delivery - they will say they tried to phone you when they absolutely didn't then you have to pay additional delivery fee.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Easy to use, easy to place orders, and you can keep track of all your orders in one place. The only problem is that because I'm in Spain, some pages remain in Spanish despite me choosing the English language option. Other than that, I love it, and I love Shein Curve + Plus! Cheap, great quality, perfect fit, free delivery, and excellent discounts. You can also collect points to get money off your orders. I've just placed my 5th order 😊❤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Once you get the hang of it, the app is pretty user-friendly and easy enough to navigate. The majority of the items I've ordered have been good quality and everything is as pictured on their site. Prices are amazing too. I've only had to return 2 items (out of many) and that's just because either I ordered the wrong size or didn't find it flattering. I've had way better luck with Shein as far as clothing goes than Amazon. Smart business, they reel you back in every time you check in."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Great fashion app but, there is almost no way to report app problems, or open ticket for problems or talk to live agent. The chat AI also sucks. Recently a really annoying bug has developed: Filters for products get reseted if an item is clicked upon, that means you will have to go to the beginning of the list, losing track of what you wish listed/added in cart, you will have to set filters again, etc, etc. It took me more than double the time to find something on the app. It is very annoying."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The price is right and the app is really user friendly. However, the quality can be hit and miss. Sometimes things are so perfect you can't believe you only payed $30 for it then other times things can't even be considered clothes and are useless and completely different to the picture. It's inconsistent but if you do your research and read the reviews you'll snag a bargain."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I LOVE this app. SHEIN is an AMAZING place to buy inexpensive clothes and other goods. sometimes the seams have loose ends and the sizing is a little difficult to figure out but the quality and the price is good. Honestly, i thought it would be a scam bc it was so cheap. I was very very happy to discover that the things i ordered came in a timely fashion and they were super cute and nice. They have a points system, reviews, photos, and free shipping promotions every now and then. love it!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"App works well, company is hit or miss. Everything else I ordered I have received, but currently waiting on one that hasnt updated any shipping information in a week, like it just disappeared, nervous about trying to get that. Clothes are either really good or really bad. Reviews help some, but not always. Points disappear without warning. Use them asap or lose them."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is easy to use, has many great things, and is fairly cheap for most things being sold. Sometimes the material or the sizes are a bit misleading, but those are always included in the reviews, and are never by negatives. You get free points just for checking in, and ordering as well so it's free cash if you save it long enough. The only thing that could make it better is automatically stacking coupons."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the easy navigation of the app, the set up is easy and most of the clothes I have gotten from Shein have actually fit and are good quality. The only problem I have is the customer service portion. It's NONEXISTENT!!!!! You cannot reach a human being to resolve your issues. Basically if you have an issue with returns, package tracking, etc. you are SOL."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"An extremely poor designed app. So hard to keep a track of your order. Returns are torturous. Even though they claim the first is free you have to meet up so many requirements that you end up paying a certain amount. And then getting money back in the app takes you like forever. The app is super confusing that I doubt a sane person will find it easy to locate the returned cash. Then they have no customer service over the phone, its only online makes it even more frustrating."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The shipping is fast and the clothing is fairly cheap! The material is decent but has a bit of an icky feeling to it. Not the best if you have sensory issues. There is a wide variety of clothes from standard chic styles, cottage core, and even e-fashion! It may be hard to locate clothes of your taste when searching through the popular picks but even so the recommendations are a good way to go. Overall a great place to shop to upgrade your wardrobe without worrying about a hole in your pocket."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall I've had great experience! The clothes are inexpensive, in style and fit well. Room for improvement would be Customer Service. My 1st package was missing one (of many) shirts I ordered. Everything else was there but the tracking said it had been delivered and their records showed the item should have been in the package. No further search was done on it and no credit was ever issued. All in all it was only a few dollars, so I've continued shopping with them and have had great luck since."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Overall I've had a good experience with the app. It's well built and the customer service is good, too. I like the coupons and points option. It's complicated getting the sizing right according to the measurements. I once had items in my package canceled because they were sold out after ordering (?) idk, but besides that it's all been good so I recommend it. Payments are also secure."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shein has a huge selection of discount clothing for all. in a wide variety of sizes, also housewares, office supplies, accessories. The reviews on the app can be really helpful, including true fit. Occasionally you can get something that doesn't fit the way you expected it to but the biggest problem I've had is receiving clothing that's not the fiber described. It does take a while to receive, but the return service has been great."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really love the app and the way the interface looks, it's very easy to navigate what you want to look for. I do however wish that some of the clothing options were labeled as petite or if they even sell petite clothing. I am under 5ft and it can be frustrating at times to purchase a 'mini' dress and expect that since I purchase an xs or small, that it would come above the knee, and often times it doesn't. Other than that, the clothes are cute and I love the app"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shein is a great place to shop for people on a budget. They have some pretty good quality items for lower costs than Amazon or Walmart. I personally love their earring selection because of how fun and unique they are. Shipping is quite fast if you are able to pick expedited shipping, but like others have said, the tracking provided for packages isn't the best. Their customer service isn't great either. If you do end up buying something and not liking it, I recommend selling/giving it away"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like shopping here because they are cheaper than some other stores. Pros: a lot of their products are quite good, and this makes up for the bad ones. You can pay using Afterpay, which I really like. Cons: I've bought items that were made from cheaper materials than their product image suggested; the notifications are endless; and after the first return you don't get free returns anymore; I'd like to be able to select some items in my cart and checkout instead of buying all items in the cart."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Honestly for what Shein is...fast fashion, I think they do a great job. The quality varies a bit so make sure you read the descriptions. Also, though I know they say you can return items, you have to jump through more hoops than I am willing to (that could totally be just me) so I typically just donate or give a friend something that comes in that I don't like the fit, etc."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is honestly great. It's functional, and the cart is a great feature I've not seen on other retail apps to figure out your spend without losing sight of your favorite pieces. I have started recommending it to Lisa of people for all kinds of crazy things. The quality can sometimes be iffy, so inspect details and images thoroughly. I've only been unhappy with 4 or 5 out of ... hundreds? of items, so I think that speaks to something. Je ne sais quoi. 🖤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is good, it does not lag. Most of the items are of good quality, also. Although some are hit and miss, either missing a few prints or unlike the showed picture at all. It is also cheap! High quality for cheap prices. Shipping is also accurate and consistent. It usually takes 10-12 days to arrive to my address. The system itself is made excellently."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I very much enjoy this app. It's great for cheap fashion. Shopping and ordering are super easy, there's so much to offer that I find myself just scrolling as if it were a social media page. They offer coupons all the time and a point system when you order and review. As for returns, I'm sure it's easy but I've been had to return anything. Happy shopping!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Good experience! Great offers for points and wide variety of products but I deducted one star for shipping and delivery! They have extra shipping charges (unless you buy things above a certain value of money) and COD charges.. and returning an item is quite troublesome since they deduct money for picking up the product and sometimes we have to ship the item back. Its not a new app/company.. I think they should fix this problem and returning an item should be free of cost like other shopping apps
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Haven't had any problems, all of my purchases have been great. And the one time one item arrived damaged I was helped by customer service very quickly and given a full refund. I hope they expand on the boards areas of the app, and that in the future they add the same ability to filter and select categories and price range on the boards, just like in the wishlist."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very nice app. The descriptions are very clear and the clothing measurements are extremely accurate. Shoppers should not look at the size only, but select the item based on the measurements. The quality of the clothing and bedding is excellent. The delivery times are excellent and to return items is easy and refunds are paid within the expected timeframes."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"SHEIN is literally my new favorite website/app to shop from. Their prices are amazing, and they have so many good deals! One thing that I love most about SHEIN is the point system. You can get points on so many different things, then apply them to your next purchase to lower the price. The filters and organization is great as well, it's always easy to find exactly what I'm looking for in the right size, color, and style. I would rave on more but, I dont have any more word space. 5/5!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely love the app,easy to use. But dislike how 1 item is sometimes listed in more than one post, with a different price. Or sometimes an item is restocked and has a different description. It makes re-finding items you missed out on hard. So I'd say consider fixing these two minor things. Other than that, its a lovely app, with plethora of items to choose from at affordable prices."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein ❤️ it's an amazing app❤️ Although, i think that there should be more ways to get points. Easier points. I've also realized that the cost of the shipping can sometimes cost more than the item itself...that's very inconvenient for me. It seems like a waist of time, then I don't end up buying the item. Over all its a good app, and I really recommend this app❤️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the app! I love all the low prices of the clothing and misc items and the styles and color options. I love reciving points after i order items to use on future items, and i constantly get coupons. The only thing I didn’t like is how long it takes to arrive. 😓 Shein has 2 facilities, you either get your stuff from the U.S facility or the one in China. If it comes from the US it won't take as long, but if it comes from the one in China it takes almost a month to arrive."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Customer service is horrible at best. I ordered a few things for the first time. One item didn't fit the size described. I contacted them to exchange it and they were requiring me to send a photo with a measuring tape to prove it. All for an exchange of a seven dollar dress. I canceled my second order immediately. I will be uninstalling the second I get my refund. Never ordering again.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I truly truly love this app. I often find myself spending hours just browsing the site and the vast amount of products. I do have one small little suggestion though. I wish there was an option for multiple wishlists so I could have one set for room decor, one for homecoming attire, another for summer clothes, etc etc. It would be so helpful and keep my items organized. But other than that, this app is perfect! :)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I just love some of the styles and colours, there's something for everyone. I've been looking everywhere for tye dye, love it. The sizes are confusing tho. I bought all XL, some fit perfect, some don't. Plus it would be good if we had a choice of whether we want really short dresses or average length. I bought a dress that I have to wear as a long top. The only annoying thing, is you have to look at the app's add for 5 seconds every time you want to look or buy, very annoying."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the Shein app. It makes shopping itself a breeze (you can filter down to the size, color, even fabric you're looking for), and shipments have such detailed tracking info. It's also a bit of a community, with user photos added to reviews, competitions, and games to play. You can get points for any interaction, and those can be used as cash for your next purchase. I genuinely adore the app, and find myself window-shopping even when I'm not purchasing anything."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app! Clothes are actually really good in most circumstances, just read the reviews on an item to make sure it's right for you. Measure yourself and go by measurements, do not under any circumstances go by sizing, because each item dramatically differs. It is an incredibly good app to use, easy, straight forward and good, cheap clothing. Could have more in the way of shoes and different colour options on each item. If you are on this app for 10 hours, you'll not reach the end of items."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"A very unpleasant experience in terms of me trying to return the order. Have been trying to get the product returned for the past 2 weeks. The delivery partner for shein has been sending me messages saying that the delivery agent will come and pick up the order and they have also been falsely updating- ""unable to pick up the package for the past 2 weeks"". This is blatant lying as no one turned up to even try and collect the order. Inspite of getting in touch with the customer care, no action has been taken. Never going to order from shein again."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent service. I love this shopping app. It is very affordable and racking up points makes a huge difference in price when ordering. I love being able to apply those points and use a coupon. I'm trying to figure out the VIP level up process. Some products are hit or miss, but overall I'm very satisfied with everything I've received. Processing and shipping is very fast. The outfit contests are fun and gives me a chance to exercise my own style. I love it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Shein is super sketchy. When you go to purchase the items on your cart the prices fluctuate. It may say $6 for something in the cart but as soon as you go to insert your card info the price will jump to like $10 and you either have to cancel the entire order (and delete everything else in your cart) and start over or just pay the price. In my last order, the price of every single item changed by just a few cents, probably to make it seem less noticeable. But the total jumped from $27 to $34."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is so well made! I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys shopping online. I has been wanting to find certain clothes that I could change my style with and I found the perfect stuff on Shein. It's literally addicting! Shopping on this app is so much fun, and the whole points thing is such an awesome idea. Obviously not EVERY product is going to be perfect, but for the prices what would you expect? You guys did great!! Thank you so much!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The translation to Portuguese is a bit odd. Almost as if it's Google translator settings and not a proper professional who took the time to find the correct equivalent to what the materials and clothing articles are actually called. If you know nothing of English it's quite difficult to search for what you want. Other than that, lovely app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Delivery time is fast, a variety of quality but always great prices. They do tons of flash sales, promos, and other sales, plus give you free coupons. There's even a point system when you review their products. You can use those points for future purchases! I've had a great experience with this app. They make it easy to find items you want at a cheap price. The app is also super easy to browse. They did a great job!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have uesd the SHIEN app and ordered multiple times from SHIEN and it has always been a great experience. One item that I bought from them I had to return ( for sizing reason's ) and had no difficulties in returning the item. The SHIEN app allows you track your packages coming from as well as going back to the warehouse. Very pleased in my experiences with SHIEN.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have never had such disappointing experience with online purchase like I had with this. The fabric texture is terrible, too thin and cheap. The sizes are all wrong. I ordered all in S but some are too large, the other are too small. I live near one of the biggest textile markets in my country so I can estimate the real values for these. They are worth one eight at least the price they have up here. I would never buy from Shein, never again. The app is good though."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I recommend most clothing items on Shien except the swim wear. The swimwear isn't inclusive. I ordered bikini tops in a large and recieved them in a small. Despite this, the items are good quality and are sold at an affordable price. The return process is also painless. There are lots of discounts. I personally enjoy the favorites page. It doesn't delete an item you like simply because it sold out. It gives you the option of finding similar items and notifies when your liked item is in stock."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great clothes and app is really easy. I find clothes overall are amazing, though some items are of less quality. But you can normally tell what you are getting by the photos and how they advertise it, you will never get an item that seems a different fabric to the one advertised just might be thinner materiality. Even if the materials are not robust, they seem to always look good on, I find. The sizing is accurate to me, but obviously everyone has different body shapes so fits can vary."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love shein, and have made many large purchases with them. However a couple of days ago I received an error when placing a new order that started my account had low credit rating. This was a complete surprise to me as I've received no communication from them letting me know why my account is frozen, or what to do to remedy the issue. The worst part is the fact that I have nearly 190$ with gift card and returns. Plus frozen accounts cant use customer support, so no way to fix"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love it. Great prices and great quality. My only issue is that your reward points apparently expire after a certain amount of time. I dont think thats a nice thing to do since customers recieve points based on the money they spend and other actions they perform on the app, so i don't think points should expire. But otherwise, the app is wonderful!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've had a good experiences with SheIn. Recently received my four order,this pasted week. I am happy with the products the styling and finished products. However I've notice reviews about the local logistics company (Buffalo Logistics) they use to deliver our items in South Africa.. Personally I've never had a bad experience with them. But they service they offer isn't the greatest. When you call they never pick or they're always busy. Can SheIn please look into that."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Shein has cheap, cute clothes, and everyone is guaranteed to find something cute for a good price. However, the quality of some clothes can be super iffy, you really have to pay attention to reviews. And the shipping times are insane! It can take 1-2 months for your stuff to arrive which is crazy! Other than that, I've gotten some cute, quality items. The app is super user friendly and they make it really easy to find ""styles"" that will match you."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"lovely app ! very easy to use and has cheap, but gorgeous clothing (etc.), definitely recommend ! but i do have a suggestion. i was thinking maybe you could add an option to create multiple wishlists ! for example, if i’m getting ready for a special event i can create a specific wishlist and figure out what i’m gonna buy for that occasion, so it doesn’t get mixed with everything else !! <3"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Tends to be hit and miss, don't bother with anything under $20. The plus size range is big but completely lacking in options and is mostly conservative dress. (Great if you want abayas). It is super off putting. Other problem is sizing is super iffy and innaccurate. The measurements don't match standard AUS sizes and are smaller by an entire 10cm at least. Super aggravating. App works great though."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is easy to use and not glitchy. My only issue is that it's really chaotic with lots going on. It needs to be be streamlined for a better customer experience. It's annoying there is a 5 second ad before you can even get to the clothes. Everything I've ordered so far I have kept, the sizing is accurate and the clothes are good quality. It's the only place I've found jeans that work for me online, so very happy!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Always accurate to the picture, I can't speak for others, but sizes are always accurate as well. Depending on the style, I sometimes size up to give room. I enjoy looking through the picture reviews that other customers have posted. It's always great to see different body shapes fitting differently into clothing. The shipping time is wonderful! I live in USA and get my packages within 1-2 weeks! I have never sent anything back. I've been using this app for 3 years!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The return process on shein is very slow, the customer executives just give automated replies each time when asked about the transit time as it is ""so so slow"" also there is no option for exchange and you will be charged rs 65 for returning any product. That's very disappointing, else it has lot of varieties in each category mainly clothing, but you have to choose wisely as it can be sometimes disappointing regarding the quality of products, but it's cheap so it's okay anyway."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love the awesome selection of curvy clothes! That said, so many times there will be a top, accessory, shoes, whatever, on the model, that completes the outfit, but there's no mention of it in the description! Why on earth would you include an item that you don't sell, or even mention where it CAN be ordered, when it so perfectly goes with the outfit?! This has kept me from ordering and I've seen this mentioned numerous times in the reviews."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Some of the items are really excellent for the money. Others not so much. But you just need to pay return postage and you get full credit. The prices are so reasonable that even if you win on five and lose on one, you come out ahead. Delivery is timely, a Lnd on the one or two rare occasions where there's a delay you are given credits to your account for your inconvenience. I love this site."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I thought the clothes were going to be cheaper as there were so many offers. But then I found out you can only use one coupon. So the £3 for downloading the app or 15% off your first order isn't right unless you only want one coupon as it won't let you use both (even though it doesn't say that until you try to pay). I spent over £100 and could only use the one coupon. When I received the clothes (reading reviews) the sizes were way off and most clothes were faulty or bad quality. Cost to return!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"App is good. No problem with ordering. Pay close attention to the clothing measurements. They're accurate so I wouldn't go by your regular sizing of small, medium, large, or XL. Shipping is also pretty accurate. Sometimes item will come sooner, but for the most part it's descent. Returns are easy too. Just wait for the entire order to come before sending anything back."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Go over the measurements and read the reviews. I've ordered 2 things so far, bathing suits. It takes about 3 weeks for delivery. Not bad. Great fit on the first item. I ordered my regular size. I was off on the second and I had gone by my measurements instead of my regular size. Way too big and no returns on it. So I guess I'll be trying to adjust it. Live and learn. Good quality so far. Good prices"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Beyond what i ever expected. Perfect. I Couldn't ask for a better website. You can find anything you want, at an unbelievably cheap price , returns are really easy and get your refund back almost immediately,or within a day. Amazon could pick up a few pointers from Shein's website. My favorite thing about shein is, that it's not JUST a plus size section that you don't have to shop for leftovers... but you can see pictures of each item, on real people, to get an idea of what it may look on you."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app makes it super convenient to find exactly what I'm looking for. The categories are well defined and the filters are detailed. The size chart and model comparison help with getting the right size. The cart options are a plus if you change your mind you can select only the items you want before check out. The promos are visible and easy to add to the cart. This app is easily top five in design, usability and functionality."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Made 3 orders so far, all good quality at amazing prices. Only 1 order had 2 items to return (out of 11), and that was because we sized up. From shoes to lingerie to dresses, shirts, blouses, and more, everything has been great. We just ordered another 13 items, and we will update the review of it doesn't live up to our expectations."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app that is user friendly and easy to navigate. There is a search bar, as well as a side bar where you can shop according to categories. You can also easily filter the items by colour, size, style and even price (amongst other things). You can also sort the items by popularity, ratings, price, or newness. You can also log in to your profile and see all your points and coupons. You can add items to cart or wishlist and you can easily navigate photo reviews on the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Ok I was super skeptical at first but a friend urged me to try it out. I thought it was going to be like every Wish horror story lol HOWEVER everything I've bought from here came on time, true to size, was great quality especially for the price, and was all there exactly as it was in the photos. I was floored! Dude, I spent $43 for a long, heavier weight skirt, four bras (that ended up fitting better than the more expensive one I had), and four pairs of underwear! All with free shipping!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Fantastic. Have had zero issues with anything from ordering, returning, or quality of products. Its great being able to afford a whole wardrobe on a shoestring budget. The app is super easy to navigate. Everything really is very convenient and user-friendly. I would definitely recommend it to anyone, especially anyone who is trying to make ends meet while still needing to look professional or just express themselves."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Stellar shopping experience. You can track your faves on a separate list, get notified when out of stock items are refilled, exchange used goods for cheap, interact with live modelings, and so much more! The free shipping does take a bit longer than most of used are now used to thanks to Amazon, but it's worth it and most items are eligible for express shipping."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So many discounts, gifts, surprises, free trials, quality clothes choices, thorough reviews, incentives, etc. I am beyond amazed! They have exceeded my expectations. Great prices and sales too! And I like how they have options and pictures of ways to put an ""entire look"" together. 😊 Thank you! I would like to suggest expedited shipping options and the opportunity to use more than one coupon at a time. Thank you!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Stylish and affordable for the most part but I gave 3 stars because some items are not as described and the materials used can be super cheap and super thin (where you can see right through). Returns are a no-go, it is not worth the cost. Also the sizes are not always accurate. Some run big. Some run small. Check the customer pics, if there are any, to find someone who's you body type. If there are no pics its cross your fingers and hope for the best. If you are on a fashion budget, go for it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"App is really easy to use & maneuver. I have mixed feelings about Shein, their products are hit & miss. Their plus size offers fun & cute styles, which most mainstream brands don't. The flip side is that the material, size &/or cut can be hit and miss. I haven't had too many issues but I know there is a lot of controversy about Shein & that they are contributing to a lot of fast fashion & waste. I've placed an order for 1 item & it'll probably be my last before I shop more sustainable & ethical"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I would say that the clothes are really fashionable and affordable at the same time which is a difficult combo to find but there's a major glitch which I think is stopping the customer from using it regularly. The collection is great but it's the need of the hour that they start focusing on reliability. I have personally ordered some items and they neither have a customer care number/email id nor do they have an option to cancel the order. When you click on the option it just keeps circling back to the same page. It's vital for their growth that they address such issues because I have myself interacted with some friends too which find it highly unreliable for the same reasons. This prevents the customers from passing on good reviews too and my sister was mad when she won't get her refund for some expensive purchase (she literally spewed profanities like anything and was all about threatening to sue ""the thing""). I have to say that their refund system is just blatantly harsh."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great selection of products. Something to fit everyone's needs and taste. Inexpensive. Shein changed up their buying and shipping and return process. It can be confusing and a bit of a nightmare. The price of shipping is usually free or reasonably priced. But the return process is where it becomes annoying. Initial returns are still free. But products come in from everywhere instead of in a single package. The return process gets all scrambled here. Not enough to miss a bargain.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"All went well until today when I can't pay for my order. Even if my credit card is ok and gives me the authorization for the payment, their system doesn't recognize my pin and says to retry. There is no customer service for Romania so I have to wait until their opening hours. It is really frustrating!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I love the products there, but the shipping experience is horrible. Every time i purchase something from there it takes Shein AT LEAST 10 days to just ship a product to InPost, although they tell it will be done in 7 days maximum. It shouldn't be like that at all, a lot of the products are in Poland already and the time of delivery is similar to AliExpress, where they deliver products across all the continent. Don't bother using Shein, they really don't care about their clients."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Excellent quality. Ships fast. I received mine two days before I even ordered it.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Shein is great value. Very stylish. Quick delivery. Great on returns.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love it !!! I got all of my stuff and they are so cute but sometimes when i order the are not with the stuff but yeah love it and all the stuff are really cute and fun to use ☺ and i love the fashion on SHEIN i love it it's better then amazon hope u do a collaboration with sanrio and miniso again ☆
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love shein! Its easy to use and if I don't like a product I can return it for free with no hassle!!! Whats better than that?! And they always have deals and discounts going! Only issue I've had is sometimes with the activity tab I can't play any of the fun freebies like wheel of love. And I can never find the wheel to spin during live videos! Maybe make sure there's no glitches and easier to find for some of the fun freebie features!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Do another of shopping here..great place to get things..but I was doing the check in every morning and 2 days before I get to the big check in..it start over on me and I miss out on some great coupons..but other then cheating me out of a few discounts. It a great place
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,One star because I ordered on the 18th of December and today is the 1st of February I have not received my order.I can not even track my order.I'm so disappointed I even want my money back at this point.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Love the app and website. Great choices. Styles for everyone.....even little odd household items. Good timing on delivery and accurate photo postings. Hate that majority of what I order is too big and the charge for returns are more then the product purchased. Plus I never see the option for a even exchange. They do how ever have some great offers and regular flash deals so regardeless of the negative... I'm still shopping 🤷🏽 guess I better learn how to alter 🤦🏾.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Shein is a great shopping app! The best part about it is being able to see the reviews on anything you choose! It really helped me feel comfortable buying from them with both customer photos and written reviews. Everything is affordable and it really helps with their point system and multiple coupons they give you. The one complaint I have is that most of the dining items are small.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Not good i have ordered .dresses which are not same as in pictures they show..and quality of stuff is very poor..totaly disappointed.color also not same..why you guys making people fool .
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am thankful that the customer service helped me with my concern. This is still one of the best shopping apps out there - point system, categories, order and delivery, and the designs. Great job! You made my day!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,At first I was very satisfied because I've chosen Shein as my online shopping center because of its daily points that if you check in consecutively you'll earn big points but now I am just earning 3 points daily I am very disappointed....
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Just made my first purchase,items arrived in a wk. Est. delivery was 2 weeks so I was happy. Shipping is a bit pricey but the App itself is well organized & easy to navigate. Quality & pricing is amazing. Colors were vibrant, material was great. Sizing can be tricky. Check out their size chart first and definitely check out my favorite part of the app: the items reviews.. most of them have customer pictures so you can get an idea of what size to get and a realistic picture of what it looks like."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This shopping platform is huge..and, it functions w/out the constant interruptions or hang ups, glitches, and programing errors that, so often, ruin my shopping experiences. This one is responsive and efficient. Sheins customer service, always, professional, considerate and consistant. The variety is amazing. The prices are unbeatable. Ive started telling all of my friends, ""Check out Shein. You can have a whole new, wardrobe. They have everything. Shopping this way is pretty, fun.""."

I opted to pay an additional $10 for air freight to make absolutely sure it would be there before Christmas. The item didn't show up until Dec. 30th!!!! I think they should, at the very least, refund the extra $10 I paid. Email response is a joke. I won't even get into how cheaply made the clock is that I paid $50 for!!! VERY DISAPPOINTING!!! NEVER AGAIN!! -5 stars"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I had to update to be able to place my order and i realized they got rid of the option to filter reviews by size and color. now you can only filter with ""includes picture"" but that's useless, because you can just click one picture and scroll through to see only pictures. so basically, you can't filter reviews anymore.😕 im glad i had that option while i was shopping...."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shein does have alot of great deals, but you have to spend so much time reading reviews and looking at photos in order to get something half decent. A lot of the products are sized very small or disproportionately so a lot of time is spent returning products as well. On that front, the returns process is pretty easy and refunds are applied quickly. If you have the time to spare to become addicted to online shopping, this app is probably the most affordable."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Doesnt allow you to delete the account. It keeps showing random error.

Parcel arrived in the country on 11/22, and it was ready for delivery by 11/24, but I received no parcel even until 11/28. No attempts were made. That's why I canceled my order by RTS. I'm suggesting that you should add an option for your customers to choose other couriers available in their country. Thanks."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Edit: I accumulated 1k points just so you can limit it to 30% of the total purchase when checking out
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Now you can only use points up to 30% of the total price????? This is trash, shein products are overpriced compared to other shopping apps like shopee and lazada, the only way it can compete with prices is thru the points where you can use up to the maximum points you have, and now you can only use 30%?? Now I'm switching to other apps, Shein no more!!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,At this point i'm afraid to place another order. I've gotten broken products. Try to get refunds. Didn't get anything back even tho I sent back their product and followed their instructions Now my order was sent to the wrong address 11 hours away from my state and of course Their customer service is a bot Or a person you text who can only help you with basic issues I don't want a refund I just want my family's christmas gifts But sadly with christmas coming soon I don't think that's happening 😕
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Basically one of my top 2! Everything comes within a week or so. Sizing & colors are perfect. Best part to me is the option to show a photo review. That helps me bc it shows what the item could look like on a body more close to mine. Not necessarily the model in the pic, if that makes sense. I love love love shein I tell everybody about it all the time!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Everything that you could possibly think of with sizes that often range from XS to XXXL. Returns are easy and conditions are straight forward and reasonable, PLUS the comment/review sections is SUPER helpful- from wether their body shape was flattered to if the product runs small what size to get. This is everything, with a super cute, simple, and convenient platform. I've never had any bugs or problems and use this app literally everyday..... my wishlist is getting out of hand 😂"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Easiest shopping app I've used. Prices are not confusing or misleading, easy to navigate categories etc. Excellent customer service. I love the items I've received- everything from clothing to homewares and nail products. If something doesn't suit you can send it back, they will cover shipping if its faulty etc. Some items are still cheaper (beauty items) on other platforms though. Shop around!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I'm disappointed I purchased a yokefellow Nail drill but it doesn't switch on It just charges I think please test your electronic devices before you send them to customers.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a great app, all new styles at a very affordable price. The only glitch here is that you might go wrong with the sizing for a few dresses as they do not follow regular Indian sizings.. but you have a size chart to help you with the same, so that sorts the entire thing. I love their styles.. they are fresh, new, unique, stylish and affordable. The good thing is that they also have a range of plus size clothing, which is a great thing. They also keep other accessories, bags and footwear, which again are of a very good quality. I think shopping from this app, is a must try.."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Hate this stupid scammy app. The offers are misleading, you only get 24 hours to get the reward otherwise you lose everything. I invited a lot of people and got to the 99.9 coins mark, after I invited another it added on 9 coins and told me I was at ""99.91"" coins. They shut down the game if they think ur cheating when you aren't. Shein, nobody will ever want to do your offers if all you do is make it impossible to get any rewards. I'm highly disappointed and everyone I invited left your app. 😡"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I've bought several products from shein I honestly love them. They're in good quality and the prices are good. My only perk is the type of carrier they choose. The option to choose the carrier should be enabled at the moment of paying instead of letting the app to select it. Usually selects a really bad carrier service on my country and I'm always having troubles with that.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Good app, skeptical at first but there are some lovely items"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"SHEIN is a fab app! The clothes are budget friendly and 9 times out of 10 very good quality. They have lots of ways to earn points and vouchers for money off. All of their deliveries have come on time, and their return process is quick and effective. Make sure to check all of the reviews before you buy items because the sizing can fluctuate per item. I bought an entire new wardrobe (37 items) in the sale for £179.53, and all but 5 of those fit perfectly, and I returned the others."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a really amazing app. Not only do you find great deals and bargains, but you can find ways to use coupons as well. I am slightly irritated by how many points it takes to do things and how far, and few in between you get chances to earn them. Otherwise it's a wonderful app and I love all the options to choose from. There's vast clothing options and the reviews make it nice to see realistic fits."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"When I first started using Shein I wasn't quite used to the size differences, so as long as I pay attention to the reviews and carefully read whether it is Asian or United States sizing you can get pretty accurate sizes for your clothing at a super cheap cost, but so cute! The app is extremely easy to use. I love the discounts I get. Also if I have to do a return or exchange they make it very easy and it's at no cost to me as long as I include everything in the order that I want to return."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's a great and easy way to shop on line no hassle with longer lines to pay. They're a variety of close to choose from and so beautiful and affordable. Shipping is safe. All sizes no more stress if it doesn't fit you can send it right back and its sp easy and it's free return .the app it's so easy to use there is no way you can get maxed up.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm having difficulty finding the same items in the Shein app that I found & love in the Aliexpress app. All in all, I really like the layout and the items that are available. App does load images a little slow but that's ok because they do eventually come up. I also like that you can post pictures in your review of the merch, makes it easy to browse clothing and other items to see what they really look like."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The best clothing store app that exists! I have spent so much money on it and I have loved every piece I've received! The cheapest prices for great quality clothes! Some people say it's hit and miss which it can be, but the way around that is to always purchase items that people have reviewed and posted photos and you can see the quality and other opinions. If you purchase things without reviews then you take the risk, but everything that has reviews are always incredible pieces. 10/10 recommend"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've ordered several times and items ate pretty good quality and great prices. Shipping is usually quicker than the estimated delivery date. My new favorite shopping app, for sure. I do wish searching by keywords were more accurate. For example, searching for mushrooms returns a few results but just random browsing will show several products not found in the search."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have had an amazing experience with Shein. The collection is so cute, you'll find almost everything in here. The prices are super affordable. Their customer service is satisfactory if not amazing. Returns and refunds are hassle free. You do have to be careful with the sizing though, but nothing that you cannot figure out after a couple of buys."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Easy to use app. Pictures and descriptions are accurate. People post pictures of themselves along with their measurements, which is more helpful than how things look on models. One problem that is happening is there are 2 ""malls"" that merchandise ships from. Which means if you order merchandise from both""malls"" and don't reach certain minimum purchase for both ""malls"" you may have to pay shipping for part of your order. This seems to be a new feature. Be careful. Shipping is pretty fast."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It is an amazing app. I have heard much about it. The payment options are also great. Plus the tracking system within their app to see where your package at is amazing. Usually all my friends get their package before thestinated time sometimes in a few days rather than weeks. Plus it's clear to see that they have great quality clothes at affordable pricings. Way to go Shein!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Adore this app! It's easy to get lost in an entirely different category than what you might be searching for though- this is not a negative comment from me! I love browsing all the options laid out or searching for that item (they likely have it!) and end up with more items in my cart, everytime! It has saved me from multiple trips, running around or ordering from multiple places- each with their own shipping and other fees.... one stop shop here! ❤️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I was worried to order from here after reading some reviews but am honestly surprised at some of the great items you can get! There is quite a bit of rubbish you need to sift through and always make sure you look at what material the items are made from as they can be very different from what you think the material is like! I've had some lovely items at great prices, it just takes a little time to look properly and order correctly!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent, excellent platform, real quality for money, very precise measurements given, user friendly, the shipping and discount structure is my absolute best (after the products, that is). The pictures in product reviews section, extremely helpful!! I like the seasonal promotional games to win discounts or points. Random free shipping offers on smaller purchases is a great incentive. My only request - bigger wall stickers on offer. They're all so teeny tiny. Love your site!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Ummm... SMH ... you can decline the advertising and the push notifications folks. I have not received a single add or notification 🤣
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love that Shein offers after pay. Everything is priced pretty reasonably and everything I ordered looked like the picture. I wasn't impressed with shipping; however, given the pandemic and all the issues surrounding that, I can't blame Shein for long shipping dates. I was impressed that everything fit well. I was a skeptic but now I'm not. Will definitely be ordering again."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! Is easy to use, my orders are easy to place, track and receive. All that I have bought is in excellent conditions/materials. They have so many deals. I normally don't buy online clothes cause ""trust issues"" lol, but all the members who buy, review the items. And they're real reviews. I love when they have pictures cause it really helps to have an idea of how it will look on me. Also, they have a check in features that gives you points and those points can convert to real money!$"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The points per day is a huge scam. They go up and down a lot. If I had 600 yesterday, how do I have 560 today? Yeah, Lies and FAKE."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great range of products, good price and great quality products. Only thing that's not great is it hard to search for stuff, it's a matter of the correct keywords to find an item at times if it is stocked. The other thing that's not great is I cannot see where we can exchange items like a too big top etc. Also its really annoying that promotional/sales items cannot be returned or exchanged, so very wary of buying then as I be stuck with it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely L O V E this app the clothing is amazing and it is fantastic quality. I do think some things are a little overpriced, but overall the prices are pretty solid. I adore all the sales and discounts they give, it really helps since money is rare bc of COVID-19. The clothing does run a little small, but just ordering a size larger should do the trick. Overall, I love this app and will probably never delete it off my phone. I absolutely recommend!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very nice coming all things same like a picture only the problem is delivering delayed but other think is very good
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Pretty great experience so far. Variety is so extensive and I like that I get a notification when a style comes back that I may have missed. Also love the suggestion of other options in case the style I like isn't available in my size. Shipping is satisfactory as well. Just would like if some styles were not so thin resulting in being very revealing. Otherwise, I'll keep coming back."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have ordered a few times and everything has been as the pictures show. It might not look as good as it does on the model, but it is the same lol I have also made a return and it was an easy process. I love how you can earn points just by checking in each day and for rating your items and then use the points as money towards anotherorder. They also usually always have coupons available and free shipping when you spend a certain amount. Overall a great app!! Only downfall is you keep spending 🤣"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great shopping app! Quality clothes at amazing prices! With their awesome sales, deals, and coupons, Shein is definitely an app worth having. The reviews are honest and the photos allow you to see how the clothes look on real people with all different body types. I have been very satisfied with my orders. I have made 2 so far. The delivery time was surprisingly quick and I was able to track my orders from the ship date to the delivery. If you can't find something for you, you're not trying!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely amazing clothes!! Their heels are so comfortable as well 🖤. I love the convenience, you can literally shop for clothes, shoes, hair accessories, body jewelry, ring lights and other electronics all at one go? Not forgetting bedding and hair extensions too! <333. I absolutely love Shein. The refund policy is quite easy too. I've once ordered the same product twice but I was able to ask for a refund even though my cart was already cleared. User friendly app too 🖤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is an excellent app! Easy to use, I love that I can build different boards to save styles that I like. The order and return process is so easy and reliable. I've never had an issue with the logistics. There are so many clothes to look at and I absolutely love that customers not only share pictures and reviews but we get rewarded for doing so!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am yet to receive my order, my orders was split into two and when I received the local one, I clicked received. Only for me to realized it had all orders ticked. Upto this moment, I've not gotten any updates on the order. No means to reach the customer care, you guys are terrible."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They turned it into wish/temu with all those sponsor deals you need to share around to get free stuff. They list prices lower than they actually are at checkout,which is something they only started doing when temu rolled around. What little good shien had has been removed"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"There are so many insanely cute clothes on this app. I don't think I will ever see everything but I love how when you choose an item to look at, you can scroll down and see like 50 more items that are similar. That makes things super simple. Also, there are always tons of reviews, a lot with pictures (I guess you get points, when people vote your review is helpful, that you can in turn redeem for purchases.) Not to mention, everything on here is so affordable; it's crazy!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Awesome app, reliable & very cost effective! Maybe make it a little easier to collect points especially with the daily login where it resets to 1 point. Also some items are advertised like the bathroom mat sets & then when u get them, they aren't the same colour as the advertised picture & some of us order according to a colour scheme, so it virtually messes that up. It would also be nice to get some more discount from a lower price since some of us order often. Other than that, no problems."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Yes, it has a bunch of different stuff. However, when I ordered a dress and a pair of shoes for a dance I had on the Sept 29th, and it said it would deliver on the 24-26 so I thought okay, they didn't deliver till the 30th of Sept. Also the dress was way to big even though I used there size chart, and the shoes was so uncomfortable, over all just not a good experience at all."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,So far I have fallen in love with the app it is everything and very understandable and easy to use and purchase on it I love love it
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've only had positive experiences with this app. I think shein has great discounts on cute and fashionable clothes, accessories, stationary, and more. Whenever I place an order, it always arrives several days - oftentimes a week - before the estimated delivery date. I love the points system. It's easy to get $1-6 off a purchase from accumulating points/rewards on shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The choice is fantastic, and for the price, so is the clothing. It would improve the experience, if when you save an item, it would save your size too. At the moment, when you view your saved items, you don't know if it's still in stock in your size without clicking in to it. Other than that, I've spent hundreds and hundreds of pounds...so far! I've found the App really easy to use."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Shein has a wonderful selection of what seems to be very nice clothing, at very very VERY good pricing. However, when you need to return an item, prepare for lots of conversation with a computer, lots of unhelpful answers and absolutely not a single actual person to help resolve your issues. I have a shirt to return, that I can't, because they don't have proper customer service to handle situations that their computer chat can't figure out. I am still waiting for assistance by the way."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Shein is currently running a scam, which tells everyone they are 1 coin away from winning £300 and it says to share to unlock it. It is in their ""play to win prizes"" section. Nobody wins this specific prize at all. This is illegal in the UK Fraud Act Legislation 2006 section (1).

Make sure to read the sizing chart because the sizing tends to be all over the place. Some things are huge- some tiny. Others-perfect!

It looked used and worn out and since that day I've been trying to contact them and I've been trying to upload the pictures but this app has a major glitch where you can't tap to upload the photos more specifically its ""the select photos"" option so I couldn't place my request... I'm in love with the dress but just send me a way to contact these people... No calls can be reserved nor I can upload a picture before the days of returning must be finished. It's one of the dilemma and worst experiences."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They chagre you more than the purchase total. Had a order of 125 and was charged 145. The app use to be good but it has issues which the ""customer service"" fails to address. They have coupons and they will say you qualify to use them, but when you go to checkout they don't work and it's because it only applies to specific brands. Clothing quality ranges from 0-10 and you just never know what you will get. After you order some items, they change to non-refundable. Items are missing from orders."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Look at the sizing charts on each item before ordering. It is not a standard U.S. sizing so pay attention to each item details. Takes a little longer to get but worth the wait. For a fairy low cost I've been impressed with all my items from shein. All items have looked like the pictures and fit if you pay attention to the size charts and reviews.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is easy to navigate and makes you want to buy more clothes!!! 🤩 As a Shein addict, I can say that you get what you pay for. Although the shipping can take two weeks at most but if you're patient, it really is worth it! Make sure to read the reviews, not just the provided measurements, to know your right size (size down, true to size, size up). Return/exchange is easy and hassle free, plus it's free! Lastly, the discounts are huuuuge! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ for this app!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,As a chubbs girl...this sheet is so good. Fits mostly well. SO CHEAP. Decent shipping time for coming across the world.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The website is easier to navigate compared to the app. EDIT been using a while now. Its easy when you know how. The only thing I don't like is points gained can be lost if not used. The timing to use is too short, in my opinion. Still giving 5/5 because I love the clothes, offers and service. Shein gives the fabric details which helps me know what size to buy, with less chance of returns because of fit."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"*Update, see dev response*: Perfect example of why uninstalled. I'm not going though a multi step processes to turn down how many ads I get when I can just shop somewhere else. Installed yesterday and have since gotten over 20+ popup notifications from the app advertising products. Not okay. Way too invasive and aggressive. Uninstalling was just easier than trying to figure out how to tone down the overly aggressive advertising."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein, they do have great prices and selection of products. But here lately shipping has been taking forever, use to it took 7-10 days.

They have THE best selection of online plus size clothing I've ever came across & all of it is extremely affordable. They also have lookbooks & so many other cool app features like contests, wishlists, styling tips, you name it. The only con I've noticed is that, some not all, of their clothing isn't of the best quality. But it's not like a hit or miss, it's more like a few & very far in between kind of thing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is good. Everything is good except the delivery schedule it takes too long,like compared to shopee, lazada, and tiktok,it just takes 4-7 days to get delivered even though it's from anothercountry Shein takes about 2 weeks to get delivered like who can wait that too long when they order cloth that they would wear for any upcoming event in their life, the event is dont yet the cloth they ordered hasn't been delivered. I would suggest that they should deliver our order faster than 2 weeks."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am not sure what's the problem, however, shein Morocco had doubled or more the prices, especially compared to other countries. They removed the loyalty program for Morocco. The coupons and promo codes are not really interesting... Especially compared to other countries. The delivery takes a lot of time and it s becoming more and more expensive (no free delivery even with high amounts)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Awesome app, a lot of the clothes are super good quality and they have so many different styles. I also love that they have the curves+ section, it really shows that they want to make clothes for *everyone*, not just people with ""normal"" body types. Denim jeans are probably my favorite thing that i got from here, they are cheap, fashionable, and sturdy. My only recommendation is just to watch out for clothing with text graphics on it, they have a tendancy to have typos and improper grammer, lol."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Slow delivery but overall quite a good app! Excellent clothes.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I order in Shein since 2021. T'was great & what I love about it is the points and the shipping. Before, they allow you to use all of your points in a product and it has free shipping every weekend. Every purchase I made, I pay only P300 below (Philippines). The reason why I gave 2 stars because Shein is not like before anymore. Points are limited, only 30% of the product will be added, they has no free shipping every weekend, they just allow you free shipping when you order P250 above. So sad :<"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The customer support is also top notch. You get what you see. Love that people can show reviews of how the clothes fit them and you can filter reviews. It helps a ton. Also love the daily point that goes to your purchase. Annoyed the 20% off is no longer a thing for orders at $69. It's 15% now. Also annoyed that I don't get my full points when reviewing ever. It's always least 40 points off even though do 3 photos and over 20 words. The tracking is on point and great though.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Its A very good and cheap shopping app, the pricing is most of the Time affordable. I am obsessed and it's the only online shop I buy from. However there are some items like pens, note pads etc that don't allow you to choose an option of what design you want, instead they would send you randomly which I think is okay for most of the people out there but for me I really don't like getting random since I'd like to choose a design myself. So I wish shein could add options it would be amazing. 🤩"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is the best app ever💕 it has really cute clothes l was planning to order on May but I heard your closing l am so sad😭😭
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Used to be very excellent app but recently it doesn't work in Egypt is there a way to fix the problem please
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"You can't make any negative reviews on anything. It does give you the option but you can't select it. If you go bellow the required price for free shipping because of a coupon, you don't get free shipping which is annoying in my opinion. It's still a small price to pay for the amazing variety of products not to mention the price and the fast shipping! The quality is also surprisingly good considering the cheap prices."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I had given full stars to this app after I placed 2 orders. All the products were awesome with quick delivery. But After 3rd order which I tried to place so many times, cart kept being empty and I had to put the products back into my cart for so many times. I never was able to pay with my two of my debit cards. There was some stupid error message that kept on popping on the screen. I was never able to place order which was of around £50 and wanted to use July offer. It has become an awful app!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very pleased! Lots of stuff you can't find in stores & many styles so you can truly shop for every age & look. Measurements given are accurate, I ordered erring on past experiences with other companies instead of by measurements given & had to exchange. Exchanging was fast & easy! Only advice, if you find something that you really like don't hesitate too long because odds are you will miss out. But can generally find something very similar. App is well designed & easy to navigate, always a +!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,In my first order was really great until i need to refund my order bec of bigsize of the item its really hard to refund the item i cannot even contact the area that is nearest to me that i was suppose to drop the item. I hope you change the way of refund like lazada or shopee. Very easy to send back. Since i cannot refund the item i stop ordering in SHEIN. The item i suppose to refund is worth 700pesos my money flew just like that i cannot use the item. Not really satisfied about it.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"As a plus sized woman, I love the products on Shein. But, when it comes to sales, we are not included in some (like the current BOGO) or our clothes are hard to find current sales in. I went in to their BOGO, and it was all for smaller women, and I couldn't filter it by size. after scrolling for almost 10 minutes, I haven't been able to find one plus sized item nor find a BOGO in the plus sized section of the app. Very disappointed. (Also adding sizes to the filter would be appreciated)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I shop Shein often, usually more than once per month. However, sometimes, scrolling thru the app is like a never-ending black hole. However, when ads pop up on social media, it's always the good stuff. What I see on social media are not always easily found using the filter criteria on the app. Sometimes I also struggle with the sizing. I'm an XL or 1X, in some things I need a 2X in other things a 2X is too big. Read the reviews as they usually let me know how I need to order either up or down."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I really love shopping at Shein but the taxes is to much .Buffalo is charging to much so I don't know how long I can keep up
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love Shein. Have placed several orders so far, and have yet to be disappointed. Free shipping promos occur quite frequently, which is a huge influencer in my decision to buy anything. Daily Check ins are totally worth it, have enough points(dollars) to get at least a couple bucks off an order every week or two. Amazing! Have been absolutely obsessed with every item of clothing I've received to date"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"App works well, easy to navigate. You can put items on your wish list, option to find similar items, always restocked. Orders comes fast or earlier than expected. Most matches the pictures. Yes strongly recommend you read the reviews and pleaseeee look at the description of each item to see what they are made out of!! I've made the mistake of thinking I was going to get a cotton shirt but it was rayon or polyester instead because I didn't look at the details of what I ordered beforehand."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app, cheap clothing for the most part. But sometimes the fabric is really thin and bad, doesn't fit the right way, etc. on the model, everything looks super cute, in person, not so much haha. So it's a hit or miss in items. just read reviews and study those pictures provided by customers!! you can tell quality most of the time"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I really like this app a lot. It is cheap and the things you sell are packed neatly. That is why I am rating this app 5⃣ five stars ⭐.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is SO much easier to use then the web page! Other places (FN & others) try to make their apps too complicated with too many ads and pop-ups. I got in, got a few things I needed (too many) and was done in 10 minutes. In the world of Covid, shopping apps have become a necessity, and SHEIN knocks it out of the park."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app!! All the clothes are super cheap money wise, and super trendy. I definetly recommend if you are looking to find new clothes for your wardrobe on a budget. It is also super easy to manage. The only thing that confused me at first was the sizing, but I found the size chart and was able to manage. Overall I love shein and will still continue buying from there."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Normally I have no habit of buying clothing items online, especially shoes, as I am always afraid to get the wrong sizes. It is my first ever experience of online shopping and it was amazing. Really loved it. Will order more. Efficient, ordered 2 pair of shoes and 3 dresses, really happy with the result as everything matches perfectly well. Very satisfied. Highly recommend."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The watch repeat one app twice and it difficult to connect it disconnect to my phone.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The prices are so good it makes me want to pick a lot of things because you actually can, there are some dresses for instance that have many different colors and even prints and others that come in one color but lots of different styles and the filter is great because it lets you select the size you wear the style or the fabric that you prefer and funnels out everything else. This is a great company from everything I can see!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"As I said before, I love this app. BUT, sadly it has been a bit weird with the free shipping fee, it's $14.99, and it can be free shipping when it's $120+, which (in my opinion) is too much. Even before it was much more nicer when the shipping fee was $3.99, but it's too high. If I don't see a change soon I think I'll have to uninstall since $14.99 fee is too much. Overall, nice app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been shopping with Shein for a while now, and I have found all of my experiences with them were/are amazing. They ship really fast and have a great number of discounts always available for members, even first time shopper benefits are over the roof. Just a bit lacking in the quality of some of the items sold though, you find that they're nky very durable at times but that's just a few. Other than that, I highly recommend Shein to anyone wanting to spoil yourself or your whanau on a budget👍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I found many outfits that were cute, and I loved, but for some reason, I had no credit cards or gift cards that would work for this app. Some of the outfits that people bought me, were way too small! But the app did help me find some summer clothes that I was able to wear, and those were perfect. If you want to just browse for cute clothes to buy, you should definately get the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The organisation gives you rewards for reviewing their product so they have built in the function to be able to review what you have ordered. it will give you extra points for submitting a photo however the button does not allow you to take or select an image. the app just stop functioning there. annoying because the pics are on the phone and i dont want to use desktop to do this.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Perfect quality, nice prices, horrible shipping experience, loooooong time waiting, some times i was thinking of canceling the order, and it is better to wait more than 17 days for some useless accessories, if you have time, enjoy waiting and shop from shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing! Branded shops like zara & primark are a bit pricey, but with SHEIN you get great clothes with GREAT prices! And they don't just do clothes; accessories, storage, shoes...! Some of the sweats are very thin like tops, but a majority of the items are great quality. The only downside is the shipping fee; when you order an item, you have to pay £4 for shipping to the UK, which is a bit much but it's 100% worth it! It always comes early, and let's you see where it is! Completely reccomend! 😁"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Tried to return items and took pictures as instructed for return. Message stated they determined they had been used and therefore could not be returned for refund. One top was of poor quality fabric and the other was too small. I tried them on only. First and definitely last time I order from this company.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I'm trying not to go crazy for the clothing because I'm poor and I love looking great it makes me feel greater.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Too many reminder messages no ""ads"" but it tells you every time something similar to ANYTHING you've clicked arrives or goes on sale ...a little annoying Update to developer: I did...but there were notifications for EVERYTHING! Every time I liked something...or clicked on something...it was just overwhelming! It would just keep resetting itself every time I visited the app and liked/clicked something new! I know how to alter my notification settings! It was just a little intrusive for my taste!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I actually love this site but you have to really do your research in the reviews of the product you intend to buy... When i first started ordering i had some hits and some misses.... If you're looking for something affordable and in style and ballin on a budget like me, Shein is where its at! I've never had a problem with shipping or returning items! Overall... Probably my favorite low end store."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is the best shopping online I have ever used they even expedite shipment if you want they don't charge a lot and give you discount sometimes free shipping been using this app for 1 year and it doesn't give me any issues almost spend R7000 in this app and my wardrobe is full of Shein Clothes its giving fashion sense wish that Shein could promote me one day send free clothes so that i can review them Thank You🙏
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"+ Nice store online. I like the products I bought from Shein. - A small issue I encountered: when trying to submit reviews of an order with more items, as soon as I add a picture, everything I wrote previously disappears. I tried 3 times, then I let it go, as I couldn't submit my reviews... 😏"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The best cloths, house hold(decorations) and make up app ive ever used, allows you to create a whole outfit while choosing items, very cheap items all the time and you earn points everyday which you can use later on for a discount at the checkout. 2 week delivery time, always on time, haven't been disappointed in a year so far. Definitely recommend!! ❤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Hi I love the stuff I love everything but like ik this is my problem but I'm 10 years old and getting a lot of stuff for my sister and I can't pay because I don't have a credit card and my parents won't let me use theirs so can I put every thing except for the Zip code pleaseeee and I'm so sorry that I'm begging but like I can't put the zip code
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Keeps cutting out.Can't find a item what's on your front page.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love the app and the customer service, use it on a daily basis to save clothes for later. The only thing that would make the app better to navigate would to add the option to sort stuff in your wishlist. The only annoying part of having a huge wishlist is you gotta dig to find anything, so I think it'd be helpful to add the option to add folders to be able to seperate wishlist items."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Prices on Shein are good but there are 2 major problem. 1. it still shows Chinese interface even though I picked English. Yes, I'm in Taiwan but that doesn't mean I read Chinese and the option becomes meaningless. 2. After logging out from one Google account , it will not let you log in with another Google account. You're stuck with that one. I had to reinstall it. Again, the option of signing in is meaningless. I'm on S20 Ultra with the latest Os."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great store to buy cheap and affordable clothes from that also look great and are trendy. Sales are plentiful and change regularly making the app worth checking everyday for the next best deal. There's lots of ways to save money; buying clothes, playing mini games, reviewing products and even just checking in will net you points and coupons you can use for your next purchase. However, some items don't have measurements or sizes on them and some also feel cheaply made."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"As a fashionista, and editor of the fashion section you can't go wrong, i do reccomend the website to avoid problems for sure! This is perfect for littles, it's inexpensive and super stylish watch for who the model is it will definitely show if that may be ""too revealing"" on your child based on age. I love the clothing items here but especially for kids! It lets them be trendy and stylish without wasting too much money of they ruin it! It can definitely help keeping them up with the trends!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great shopping experience. They need to stop with the points expering. I check in every day to get my points, but I can't get past $8.00 off because they expire so quickly. It's not fair for those of us that want to buy a large order and want to have a larger amount taken off. I get that coupons expire but these points shouldn't. Otherwise I like the app and I love the clothes that I have bought from there."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Ordering and delivery was easy and quick. Unfortunately, you get what you pay for. Items just very cheaply made. Everything felt disposable as if you could only wear once and throw it away. I'll still place other orders, I'm sure, to try out a few different items to see if I can sus out what types of items are best to save money with and order from here."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Everything is at your finger tips. I like the option of being provided coupons for extra savings and gaining points when you write a review. The points come in handy when you decide to shop again.When you are able to reach a customer service representative the assistance is always conducive. 95% of my orders are exactly as displayed on the models. Refunds are made easy for items that are not as displayed. The orders usually ship quickly and delivery is generally within a week of your purchase.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Please give more shipping options if Quickship is not available for my country. Thank you.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"So far I've purchased $300 of clothes from here. Everything is great for the most part and for the price. Sizing and colors have been accurate. Some items lack of quality despite the excellent reviews you might see on them (Thin, see-through, tears easy, bleeds dye) despite the excellent reviews you might see on them, but I guess that's just what you get for the price on some items. Overall I'm happy with what I've got."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,My app was replaced. Now I can't track my orders. How can this be corrected. But all ways enjoy shein.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So im really happy with my experience with Shein so far and i really like the app too! My fave pass time is filling up a shopping cart and then closing it & this makes it very easy! no but seriously, the app is quick and super user friendly. I love all the filters, categories and their sizing chart is fantastic. If youve never ordered from Shein before, i would just suggest you check the reviews, use the size chart for EACH ITEM and that you search for good materials to hold up in the wash!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"So far my daughter's and I have liked Shein. You can't beat their prices. However, the quality of the clothing is hit and miss. It seems like it's getting better. Also the sizes are not consistent. But when you click on the size it lists the measurements, so be sure to pay attention to that. Shipping is also hit and miss. Sometimes things will get here within the same week and sometimes it takes 2 weeks. But the bathing suits are super cute and cheap. Overall I would recommend shopping on Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Successful payment.. but not received email.. i just get email but the method payment is COD... but i just do online payment 😔😔😔 i lose my money
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Its an app that has great products and shipping is pretty fast. I like that they include all shapes and sizes but what I dont like is you check in every day and yet you have check in points that expired. It also has a these points are going to expire but no explanation as to what points. So really there is no point in checking in every day.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I had my doubts about Shein thinking that the the products would be different from what you see on the screen but generally speaking I'm very satisfied with everything I've bought. Some of the clothes are a bit flimsy and the stitching isn't great but for the price I don't think you can expect much more! Sheglam products are excellent as are the Home and decoration products.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Overall the clothes are cute but not only did the shipping company lose my package, but Shein won't let me do anything about it. It's almost Christmas and I won't be getting my package, this shop has horrible customer service. I don't even get a refund, that's literally $175 down the drain. Thanks a lot Shein!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love Shein because of their selection from clothes to shoes to home supplies and more. The ONLY (at least the only one I can think of) thing I don't like is how long shipping can take, but it's not terrible at the same time. They also use to have a feature where you could see how many items you've seen while scrolling i.e. ""Women's brown crop tops £1-£15"" scrolling past 10 items will show 10/300 etc etc. Not sure why they don't have this feature anymore since it was so helpful 🤷"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,They have a wide choice of items and excellent postage times would buy again 4 sure.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Top 3 places ever all time favorite shopping app. Better quality then some of the other guys and I'll forever be a Shein Haul Girl. It's just when Shein comes in the mail. I'm happy. Like really happy. So thanks a lot. I appreciate you and your awesome clothes and home goods and your black Friday sales are to die for! All year long really you have fun live events. I had to work when you were in SF ;( and literally got their like 2 mins too late. But I hope you come back & I recommend this app!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing. Buy from here often and all items have arrived in great quality and comfortable to wear. Although shipping is sometimes a few days longer than expected, the packages are easy to track instantly. The free trial option is absolutely a fantastic idea and well implemented, although the name makes it seem as if you rent the clothes and that is not the case. This feature really makes this app stand out against its competitors."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great if you need cheap clothes. Lots of search filter options to make what you want easy to find . Room for improvement: Would be nice if you could set alerts for keywords or save searches (eg. Right now full length cotton ringer tees, only cropped ones and mid rise leggings aren't in style, only high rise), but it would be nice if I didn't have to do the same searches all the time. Since it uses key terms for searching item descriptions, seems like it could be a feature."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I just want to say that I love shein they have great products. I just made an order last week, and I just received it this morning, and I really appreciate their quick service. I have one more thing to say is that I had ordered from the other company first and I haven't received my order yet? Thank you"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The app is pretty organized and its fairly easy to find what you are looking for with tons of variations of products. The shipping takes a while but for the price it's fine. I like the opportunities to earn points and all the fun stuff they do to earn them. There are constantly discounts on top of already discounted clothing. The clothing isn't super nice quality but its all pretty trendy stuff at really inexpensive prices and you can find classy stuff too at good prices which is really nice.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I never had any problems in the past with Shein especially when local courier was ACS. Since they changed courier to Speedex the service is worse than any other app i purchase from, i have to re-think more than 10 times before i spend any money because is all based on luck if it will come or not! Last delivery never came, it is still after 25+ business days showing it arrived in Athens but doesnt show me where. Local courier customer service, is inexistent everytime i try to contact them."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"They do have amazing prices and great selection and quick delivery. I'm excited everytime I see a package on my door step. HEADS UP **You will receive what you pay for. Don't expect Vuitton quality at a thrift store price** My only complaint is that most of Blow Out sales that I get constant notifications for where its Free Delivery for 16hrs, 90% off, Buy 1 get 1 Free, Buy 3 for $24... Are not optional for the plus size section. Other than that I love the app 💕💕💕"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"All round excellence! I've been a regular customer using the app to order for roughly a year now. I've never had any issues with the actual app and I've never had any issues with my orders. I recommend choosing items wisely by doing due diligence (check measurements, material, reviews etc) so as not to be disappointed on arrival.Infact, the one time that I changed my mind about an item and started the returns process I was given an immediate refund and told that I could keep the item for free!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Going downhill fast. I've been ordering for a while now and the quality is getting progressively worse. Of the last 18 items I've bought, I've returned 12 for wrong sizes, cheap material or shoddy workmanship. I probably won't buy again."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'll give it a 3 star for some reason. One, it takes too long to received that you ordered, and it can be delayed sometimes. And ofcourse, I want you to make—to contact/chat the seller so we might get an update since the buyers came from different countries."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Every time I am looking for something I always end up getting it at shein because they have some of the cheapest prices. Obviously things like wish and ebay tend to be cheaper but their items take forever to come and end up being terrible quality. I have not once been disappointed by the quality of a shein order I really wonder how they do it. And I really can't express how helpful the reviews are on each product, since people are able to post them wearing or using the product."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is easy to use, has a lot of different items to chose from, ways to get points, and videos showcasing fashion and Sheglam application tips. The prices are great! Some of the downsides are I am plus size and almost all of the plus size is modeled by people that are mostly on the skinnier side. They don't have truely plus sizes for men either. Most of the fashion is great, but there are a lot of crop tops, wish there was a choice on regular or crop."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent Will be busy more and recommending to others , Service quick delivery very quick"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great clothes at good prices. Easy to use app. The categories are easy to navigate. Filters are so useful and easy to use to help you search for your size or to keep within your budget search for things only in a certain price band,just 2 of the many. Great offers on voucher discounts and free delivery offers. Delivery never seems to take too long and you're updated on the process when things are dispatched. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them for clothes, homeware, footwear, and accessories,"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Discovering shein was dangerous, because there are some amazing bargains to be had. The app works extremely well and is generally easy to navigate. The best thing about it are the reviews because some of the items are very cheap and cheerful (so not the best quality fabrics) but other items are exceptional quality for the price. I wish their plus sizes would expand beyond a uk size 26 because they have some of the best, occasional, sexy and unusual items I've ever found in plus."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Always missing an item in my shipment or returning items where the fabric feels cheap, doesnt fit, doesn't really look like the pictures, have cheap stitching, etc. I really don't know why I try. I've ordered four times I usually only keep one or two items. Don't get my started on the bikinis! The sizing is crazy. It's really not THAT cheap overall. You really can buy cheap things locally that will be better quality."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Shein is so good love the products so far they are really affordable and have helped me as a beginner nail technician
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"If you take the time to read reviews it's possible to find the bargains. I was surprised just how nice some of the clothes are. But not only that, the app itself is fun. I love the outfit function, and could spend all day making different outfits. The fact that these outfits, and photos of you wearing the clothes can earn you points, is amazing. And there are a tonne of ways to earn points, the easiest being leaving reviews. And at 100 points = $1, it's the best value for points system."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I honestly wasn't expecting how amazing this app is. I'm astonished with how many (even a wide range) products have amazing reviews and how products come as shown in the picture. That being said, I really need yall to fix the smell on some of yall products, it's terrifying thinking of buying a new bag, phone case or Switch case, when their are numerous reviews stating they enjoyed the product, yet couldn't deal with the smell. I experienced this myself twice now. Please fix this major issue, thx"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app. Have shopped with shein for years now. The only thing about the app is it would be better if the petite clothes were all together. Also, it would be good to know before ordering if an item is in the UK or China because if you want something fast it could take weeks. Love all the reviews on the app, especially the ones with photos. I find them really helpful"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"3 stars because I've had incidents (mkre than twice) where my package arrived super late, not at all or even with missing items. On the other hand the customer service is always really good and the Shein Team always tries to find the best solution in these cases so thumbs up for that! The products are cheap but the quality is good (depends on the products but sometimes you just get what you pay for and it is still good)."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Still like the app, but I'm not a fan of the pre-worn part. You have to pay shipping on every single item (which I understand why), so if you're trying to buy on a budget that's not exactly the best route to go. Especially when you can buy new and use Klarna or Afterpay. Probably a good options for items that you might have really wanted and are no longer listed though."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Practically, this app is both customer oriented and seller oriented. U get the best quality, true to color and size. If in case u want to return, u pay for the shipping. In this case, u will only return when the product which u got is not of any use. Initially I thought it will be a problem for me, but I have shopped around a dozen time, at least 25 items, out of which I returned 3 items. So it's a gud deal."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have questions! Why did you have these awesome games such as the wheel you could spin and win points among others and now your ""Christmas games"" are a set up to get friends personal information and now your sending them all your lovely deals and coupons that will still come with high shipping costs or hidden charges. Also, my first purchases came so fast but the more you order will be the longer your package takes and the longer it takes the worst damage your packages will get. Answers?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I load up the app and that's as far as I get. It worked before black friday, I had a wishlist set up and everything. Now it just never loads, buffers for eternity. Can't get to my wishlist to send it to family for the holidays because the app just never loads. Tried turning my phone on and off, forcing app closed, uninstalling reinstalling. None of them work just like the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Bad customer service. They give no notifications of orders. Cant track properly. Return costs are very high. Not at all user friendly service. Product returning and refunding is non ending process. You have to wait too long. Products are cheap compared to prices. Fittings are never perfect. For COD you have to pay extra. I would never ever order again from here.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app has games that if you have enough people friends sign app for their app you win $300 gift Certificate it's all ashamed they don't pay you anything they don't count the appropriate people you send over there I did it in person with my friends saw them do it and did not get credit for them And this is after I've already spent several $100 with them and they can't even be honest about counting the people my referrals I sent to them shame on them And this is after I've already spent several
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Nice experience especially customer service. But sometimes I got disappointed with the material, it doesn't look thin in the pictures or sometimes it looks cotton but when I got the item it's not... that's all. but overall super okay and affordable, I hope you won't change your pricing because that's the reason why we buy a lot per transaction haha"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm obsessed with this app!!! Very easy to navigate. The prices are incredible!! The only thing that I have an issue with is the sizing because under your profile it does not give you the choice of standard US sizes, instead it's centimeters, kilograms Etc. Wish that I could just do it by inches and standard measurements that I am used to. If there is a way to do it I have yet to figure it out!? I am totally obsessed with this app and wish I would have found it sooner. Love the trial center also"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app and shop is fine, some of the notifications are good but they send them constantly. Had like 6 today (Christmas day) just telling me about sales. I could understand 1 but 6 is just annoying. I know you can turn off notifications but occasionally they are useful so it would be nice to have some sort of filter. There is also an annoying advertising splash screen, like yes, I'm already on your app you don't need to try harder to sell me stuff."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is really nice. Good range of trendy apparells. Attractive shein points feature is great, against which you can have additional discount. Great sales and dicounts (excluding points) everyday. However, They take a lot of time to deliver your products. They wont deliver asap. They never do an early delivery even when they say 3-5 days for express shopping, you'll get it on the end of 5th day. In standard delivery the 8th day not earlier than that in any case. My order stopped progressing after a point, for three days it stayed at a single stop. Annoying that is because my product didnt take that long to be shipped from another country but it longer when it has reached close to me."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Good quality and affordable items, fast and secure shipping, customer friendly, gives you discounts not only for shopping but for sharing your experience with other customers and for participating in their online events. Looking for trend and fashion inspiration? They also have it in the app. Wanna share your fashion ideas? You can do it in the app too, share your pictures, get likes from other customers. They really took shopping to the next level with this one!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Usually very good. But it was not helpful when i wanted to cancel one item from my order. I had to cancel the whole order. Further, there should be a delete option for the wishlist of items you no longer want, not just items that are no longer available. Can you help so that we can create categories on our wishlists eg trousers, tops in different folders. Thank you."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it's a nice app with what it seems like quality clothing. they have lots of sales going on 24/7. prices are reasonable, just like in the store, but Shein has more choices. I've ordered 3 items, so waiting to receive them to see the actual quality. but so far, so good. I also like how like every product has reviews with pictures, that's very nice and helpful."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app for shopping some unique and interesting styles for pretty decent prices. There's lots of things catering to a variety of interests, not just clothes. There always seems to be a good sale going on, plus they have a system where you can free trial clothing, another for earning points, even something for designers who want to create their own products. There's a lot more to this app than there seems, love shopping on here. The quality of the items is great too."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love SHEIN. So many style choices. I just wish the shipping was consistently free. Also wish I could repurchase some of the great buys I've made before they sell out. Of course, for the great prices they offer, there are going to be some not so great items received, but I think it's well worth the risk. The awesome finds definitely make up for the flops! All in all, no complaints!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love it such cheap stuff they do everything on there. Such cute stuff on n there me and my sister and her friends are starting a lip gloss componey and I'm thinking of getting lipgloss tubes from there and I know that there going to have them on there. Love shien so much highly recommend it I got a pensil case from there and coloring pens from there I'm waiting for them to come. Can't wait for them to come. So excited. And yeah love you shien byee xx.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very cute clothes for a great price ! And the app makes shopping such an easy experience. When you go to your saved list under your profile, it categories the saves you made to make your search so much more easier ! When you go to purchase, it saves your pending items and also tells you how long it will save your items that's in your cart. I love the app and the website ❤️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"""I LIKE THE CLOTHING FROM ""SHEIN"", BUT THE DRESSES I'VE ORDERED FROM SHEIN, DON'T FIT ME, BUT I PAID FOR THEM, BUT I DO LOVE THE WEBSITE REGARDLESS OF THE SITUATION. ALRIGHT!"""
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"What an absolutely fantastic app and company! Being a plus size woman, I really struggle to find a decent selection of clothing. That is, until I found Shein. Hands down I am totally spoilt for choice. The app is easy to navigate and to find what you want. The only minor criticism I have is after I've selected an item to view in detail, I use the arrow back and it returns me to where I believe I was, but the items have jumbled up. Great clothes, great prices and promotions! Very happy customer!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Edit: they have levels you can reach.. the last is s3 and you have to have spent 300 or 5 orders. I have over 400 spent there and lots of packages so I am super frustrated. OLD REVIEW: Clothes are reasonably priced if you can catch them on flash sales or live shows they always have coupons you get points for just getting on that you can immediately transfer into cash at any point I absolutely love this shopping app. Minus the fact that I've been buying so many things on it lol I'm broke
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The website is excellent 👌 the detailed measurements for each garment makes it easy to buy no matter what size or height. Love the smaller flick through pages that each one can then be moved to see the reverse of the model. Itemising each category for personal style. Giving extra details like stretch or none stretch. The little extras in life to pop in your basket such as phone covers, hair scrunches. Well I nearly covered everything but just loads more, the fun just goes on and on."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Customer service is worse. No email address mentioned for contacting, so-called customer call service is never picked up.they go on keeping you on hold and ultimately disconnect your call. Last option is live chat where they hardly care to respond. My issue was I was charged for return pick up which wasn't mentioned at the time of booking. Moreover, I was charged according to the number of orders even if all the return orders were picked together. Order# : HXL85170. Both collected on same day."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Even though shipping took a bit, my package still arrived sooner than expected. So that was a plus! All items were exactly as pictured and decent quality. Exchange/Returns were super easy and customer service was top notch. Not sure why some negative reviews are saying there was no live help, because I had no problem reaching/speaking to an actual person about my returns. Already lining up my second order with them. Highly recommend if you're wanting to fluff your wardrobe! 😊"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Ordered from Shein on multiple occasions. Cannot fault the clothing.. I tend to check user reviews of the product with images (as these are very accurate) and I have never had any trouble with any of my items (besides the odd one being too small)... But overall fantastic.. bare in mind, delivery can take up to a month, but well worth the wait 😍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love all the different clothing, shoe, purse, hair accessories and jewelry options, the points program is cool too. Check in everyday for points, that turn into real money off your order. I have recieved a few items that weren't the best but if you keep a good eye out and read the reviews, you can avoid this. Shein app is definitely worth trying out! I love it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is great. The clothes all come with a cheap reasonable price, and you can get all sorts of fashion items here, not just clothes, such as earrings, bags, necklaces and more. Sometimes the material is slightly thin on what I would expect to be thicker types of clothing, but that's beside the point. The delivery can sometimes take a few weeks but the clothes always come in perfect quality and look just like the picture. Would recommend."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app itself works well. Only issue I've had is on one section?category?- Shein Exchange. Looking at some of the listed products on the Exchange part of the site, the pages take a longer time than any other category's products to load. Shipping has been on time or earlier for each order. Quality of products (I can only vouch for clothing) is quite good. Sizing is a bit off but using the size charts helps."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app but there are a few issues.. can only search for certain sizes with the newest update and the fact that you get a notification every hour. You can't select one notification per day...or select what kind of notifications you want. If they had that option it would be great. Clothes are not that bad. Know your measurements, read reviews, and pay attention and ordering won't be an issue."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love 98% of the items I've purchased from Shein. I highly recommend knowing your sizing to get the right fit. The only thing I dislike: Returns or product query. I purchased a dress and it arrived without the attached belt. As it was the wrong season to wear it, I didn't really notice until a month later. I tried to ask for a replacement belt, but needed the receipts and postage slip etc: long gone! Dress looks silly now, and my account shows purchase, so I think that process is ridiculous."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very hard to follow to return products that dont fit. Went into my order but no ""return item"" popped up."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Amazing service.fast delivery. Returns made easy..Interest free payments over 3months.good quality clothing..I love shein..
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Impressed with the quality of the clothing considering the price. Cute stuff, fast shipping. The only thing is that its a hit and miss kinda thing. But that happens even when you buy things off the rack, not everything you thought would look cute you'll like when you try it on, and not everything fits even if it is in your size. But they have free returns so no complaints here. I odered a bunch of stuff and kept 3 items because of the length or the material being too see through or size."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app so much! so many cute clothes and other features! you can create outfits and submit it to contests, you can earn points that translate to money, you can enter ""free trials"" for a chance to get free clothes and so many other cool things! my only complaint is that I wish there was a way to change my email on my account without needing to delete it and create a new one. I also have a small suggestion: maybe use models that vary in size other than all of them being a size small."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The different searches you can do on this website are crazy. It's awesome that you can narrow down what you're looking for so well. The neckline, the length, the style, the color, pattern, size! And choose it all... No more wasting time looking at a bunch of clothing that does not fit your description. The prices awesome and there's free shipping and returns for above a certain purchase price. Can't get any better than that."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've always been skeptical about buying clothing online because of the sizes and just not wanting to return cause I assume it's a hassle. Overall, it's been great! True sizes, excellent quality, and economic prices! They have a size chart to help guide you and a model with the clothing on to get an idea of the length...etc. And REVIEWS a must have !!! Reviews with picture of the product! I love SHEIN! Oh, haven't done no returns! 100% LEGIT!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is very easy to use from purchasing, to reviewing, tracking and returns. The only complaint which isn't a complaint is there are a lot of push notifications and when searching (this goes for the website as well) for something specific the tags are off so there is a lot of merchandise that customers aren't accessing it could be bc they are adding items but the thousands but it would be great if searching for specific items they all presented versus having to do a week long search daily."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"By far the best shopping app. You can get so many cute and trendy clothes on shein for such an affordable price. Unlike other money-saving clothes shopping apps, sheins quality is usually super amazing, especially for the price! You can also save even more money than you already are with coupons and points! For example, I just saved $30 on my order today just because of coupons!! On top of that, shipping is extremely quick. I have no complaints, would highly recommend."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Everything I order from here ends up being perfect! There might be a slight discrepancy in size, but all the reviews and comments on the products that people leave always help me pick the right size. I've ordered kitchen and bathroom supplies, swimsuits, jeans, lingerie and now even products for my pets! Definitely worth signing up for an account and racking up the sweet deals and wonderful products."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This used to be a really wonderful site for cheap but decent quality items. It prides itself on trying to be economically while also financially friendly. However, more recently, the cost for some items has absolutely skyrocketed (higher than I would ever pay at a department or any other local store). So, some items are no longer worth it. Example, yesterday I had a makeup bag in my order for $3 (regular price, not on sale/discounted), when I checked my cart today, it was $7... Watch your carts!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I mean 5 stars for sure. I have only used the Shein App for about 2 months & have placed a couple of orders...with smooth sailing. Meaning no problems with billing no problems with receiving the correct items & no problems with delivery..not having to wait forever either. All of these key items have been met with the utmost attention to detail. I am thrilled...I would recommend you giving it a try for yourself.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love it. A little bit of inconvenience was the saved list. After scrolling down some saved lists and opening one of them, and wanted to get back to the whole list. It always took us back to the very top of the list which is frustrating when we want to view the bottom of the saved list items."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It took way too long for them to process my order. I actually had to end up cancelling most of it for them to send me one item of the four I had initially ordered, three weeks after the fact. That seemed to get their attention; they got my order to me in I think 2 days after that. I was very pleased, but I still hesitate to try to order from them again. Bad first experience. I would have preferred to have been able to get all 4 items. They did refund my money very quickly too, though."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Shein needs to stop splitting up customers' packages. If an item is in a separate warehouse, then inform the customer so that they can adjust accordingly. Do not inform them after they have already paid. Not everyone lives in the US, so people who are using a shipping company in other countries will have to pay extras for the multiple packages. Additionally, Shein needs to be consistent with the sizes of the items they are selling."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I tried SheIn based off the recommendation of a friend. The app itself is great, but the products from shine were really disappointing, most of them didn't fit well, and the fabrics are definitely cheap and don't hold up. You get what you pay for, so although the clothing seems to be a great price, I find that the overall value is actually a negative."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I personally have had a great experience shopping on this app. The prices are so inexpensive, the reviews on each item include pictures and can be filtered by size or color. The points feature and many coupons make it even more affordable. With the free shipping requirements being low, you can buy more for less as well. This site has a variety of categories to shop from, and have so many trendy clothes."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"SHEIN is great, it is very easy to use this app, to place orders and to do payment. Products are very nice, thank you. The pricing is great as well. There are so many products to choose from. I am very sattisfied with SHEINs' app. He provides the best communication and service to his clients. I personally prefer Buffalo to Aramex. Buffalo is much faster, best communication and great service. Quick and easy when paying costoms. Where Aramex is slow, bad communication and frustrating"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Got about 35 items in one order. Filtered it so can buy cheaper stuff and I was shocked!* amazing quality for the price and I didn't have to return a thing. Also, I got about 25 outfits and they all fit amazing. U can't go wrong! I'm sure at times u get a defective item but I didn't get one in any of my stuff and I got alot! Highly recommend! And sign up for email, they have weekends where u can get free shipping all items!♡"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app overall, I hate that the option to review items expires after a few months. I might order stuff and not wear it right away but by the time I do and go to review it, the option has gone away, and I'm talking even just orders from earlier this year, I'm unable to review. Definitely not a change I agree with, but business is business I guess. Make sure you do them right away or else you'll be out of luck!"

If it happened to me only I could've considered it a mistake but it won't go away, it happened to ALL my friends. I would expect this kind of scam from those suspicious sites, but from such a big site like SheIn? Ridicolous"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is great! So many wonderful clothing options for curvy ladies and the prices are unbelievable! Iwas skeptical at first, but I've ordered several pieces and the quality is much better than I anticipated! I never thought I would find ONE flattering, AFFORDABLE bathing suit, but I've found SEVERAL in this app. I've even tried similar apps, but nothing compares to SHEIN. Keep up the good work!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great, I've had two orders so far and both have been excellent. The size and measurement are on all items so easy to find correct sizing. I like that people can show review with photos so you can see the fit and quality of the items. I have purchased about 10 items in total and all were good, one was a bit big but that was my fault as I ordered a size up. This site is affordable and give you regular vouchers and there is a reward scheme for reviewing items. Can get free posting on big orders too"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Only issue is delay in delivering Some product does not reflect the original post. It takes too long to be delivered. Another thing with this app is,each product needs to be demonstrated with short video Another issue is, The app is supposed to be updated in a way, when the driver delivers,he should take a picture and send it to the app, so that the customers can see it,then step outside to pickup their products."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Like all the variety of products & prices for the most part. Have had good luck with customer service. Just don't like how often I get notifications and emails from Shein. Sometimes get about 8 a day. I would prefer only having to look at the site when I want to look for something, or at least only getting one message a day. Most of the time, I end up just getting upset with all the interruptions, and end up deleting them, wthout even looking at them. Too time consuming, and battery drain"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love ordering from Shien. The prices are great!! The items delivered are the items that I ordered and were exactly what they were supposed to be. I'm very pleased with the items that I ordered from the Shein app and will order again from them.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The range of products available on Shein is huge, from apparels to home decor. Clothes are very stylish and and tempting, and good styling ideas are also provided for most items. The ""recently viewed"" section is very helpful. Placing and canceling orders is also an easy process. The only flaw i found is that I don't see any expected dat of delivery. Otherwise definitely my favorite app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Cheap, cute, comfortable, and reliable. Honestly really great and dont be worried about not getting vitems because it's a random app. The clothes usually get to (me) in around a week if ordering (since they are shipped over seas). There are sometimes mini games to earn points to :) also if you return something once it's free in the us for a certain amount of days, but after the second you do have to pay a fee."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I rely heavily on seeing the measurements of like the bust, waste, hip size, etc., and to click on a size and NOT see that in the plus size clothing can be very problematic. How Will I know based on the cut of the outfit, the stretch of the fabric, versus the measurements in order to choose the correct size for me? 12/26/2023: THE INABILITY TO SEE SIZE INFORMATION IS A IT WEBSITE DESIGN ISSUE, NOT CUSTOMER SERVICE. This is the correct place to air my grievance for a APP ISSUE."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. Nice clothing for cheap but totally worth it. Plus when u play the games or review ur items u get credits.

And whenever you rate a negative review in this app, they just like to reply "" go to settings -- "" sheeshhh"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is a great place to get great deals on tons of everyday things. I have purchased things on this site at such great prices, everything from crafting supplies to shirts and clothes and shoes for kids. All of which were made of quality materials. Will Continue buying from Shein"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Easy to use app, great pricing. Item descriptions are pretty accurate, pics are sometimes a little misleading (especially if you don't look like the model) but that's why I always go to the reviews and see pics posted by customers. I wish more items were cotton/cotton blends but I know they're cheap because they're all polyester. Returns are easy and delivery is quite fast, comparable to delivery times of most any other retailer I've ordered from (Macy's, Kohl's, etc)."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Does not let you include size information. Keeps loading infinitely. New Bug: not allowing me to review despite all information is correct and appropriate.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Shein is not the same as before anymore :(( it is so sad that you can't use your points fully when checking out an item. They limit the points that you can use and ended up paying high amount of money. Not recommending this app sorry
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It's not the Shein I knew before. I really love collecting points so that I could save more when shopping but for the past months I cannot USE ALL my points for the cheaper products🙁. SHEIN pls allow us to use all our points for the cheaper products🙏🏼
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I haven't had a problem but I notice that they don't have free shipping on Sundays anymore and I don't like some stuff they sale I think it would be great to be able to block some of the images
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hi! I've been using this app for a few months now and I really enjoy it. It includes a ton of reviews from customers on the size, quality, and look of the clothes. The site has so many awesome discounts that can be taken advantage of. The customer service is prompt and kind. The site is set up in a very neat and attractive fashion....and the clothes are super cute (a few items are pricey but most are cheap.) Beware the items tend to run SMALL so make sure to order a size up. So far no problem!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I like the app but this is the second time I have used it and my package is coming a week late and I need my package because I ordered a birthday gift for a friend and I really hate showing up empty handed also it has something I need for my costume for it and twice I ordered something and both items where broken
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The best, in my opinion! You never pay full price because there are always really decent coupons. I am forever loyal to shein. My purchases always exceed my expectations :) Thank you, Shein!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The best!, it ships early and has the best clothing that are very cheap, i absolutely recommended this because it has different clothing styles and includes alot. ❤️❤️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Sometimes shipping can take up to 2-3 weeks. Not worth it. Some good prices but clothing is mostly bad quality.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is prettt great, the only thing I wish they'd change is not all of the products are modeled on a person so you have to go into the reviews and hope someone posted a picture of them wearing it. The sizing is also confusing because the size charts give a wide range so I qualify to wear a midium, large, and extra large so i have no idea which to choose."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I had some issues with their identity confirmation and customer service when I first ordered, but since then I've really enjoyed shopping with Shein. The sales and promotions are insane; full prices are generally really affordable and I rarely pay full price because there are so many discount options. The clothes are great and there are always new items. The style options are so diverse and they even do really cute homewear!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was extremely skeptical about ordering from Shein. I read so many reviews some good some bad the bad ones were mostly about the shipping so it took a while for me to finally do it. Now I'm addicted. I'm always on either filling my wishlist and or making purchases. I've had no problems with shipping, I hope I don't have to knock on wood but so far so good. I have not been disappointed yet with anything I've bought. It's been an amazing online shopping experience. Ty! Shein A 4everCustomer"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I received my first order in a descent amount of time. Everything I ordered WAS very reasonably priced & looked just like the pictures. I got two different pairs of earrings & a lips print hair Scrunchie. ALL items ARE made VERY well & I am VERY pleased with my items. I already placed a second order & I'm waiting for that one to arrive!! CAN'T wait!! Thank you for such different & unique items at WONDERFUL prices!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Shein is a good app, good products. But I ordered something ON black Friday, 2 order, 2 different accounts. I paid $178 for this order and it didn't come until December 18 when it was supposed to arrive on December 3-6. The other order came in on the 3rd."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Decent app, some things are cheap but some are kinda expensive. Shipping takes a while as it's from China."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I sign up and start to shop. Boom no more due to Unusual activity. Duh I just signed up when you talk to customer service they offer a whopping 2 dollars off and tell you get a new phone number and email address. I'd just run

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The games are shyt! Says to invite 1 friend to win prize but then it lied and you have invite 3 Says to feed the pet (game) to reach level 25 to get free gift & I been on level 20 for 3 days Bcuz the app(game) stop working and won't load ""all of a sudden"" but keeps telling me you have prizes (task) done collect food but won't load. Clothes I ordered sizes (measurements) r way off now. Ordered 10y size like usual & when I get item it's so small & it like size 5y. Way too small Price is a LIE TOO!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,No more free shipping. No more 70% off using points. It's not worth it anymore because most of your products have cheap quality but are overpriced.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app is good but the delivery service is very bad you will get messages like( I am from imile delivery I have your order send location ) I have sent my location to 3 different number but still I haven't receive my order yet. I WISH THEY COULD CHANGE DELIVERY SERVICE IN SAUDI ARABIA
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Very bad experience with a return item. The articles are good but the clothes' size do not correspond to the reality. So I returned an item and paid for it! I contest that but customer services did not refund the shipping cost and didn't care about customers satisfaction. It was my first order and the last one for sure. I am very disappointed with Shein!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shien is a fantastic app for fast fashion, as well as other products for the home. They carry men's, women's, children's, and even pets in any style or size. Items ship quickly and maintain fair quality for the most part. The app is made well and never crashes or glitches, although I wish there was a way to reply to reviews. Some of the listings use deceptive sizing or display to make you think you are receiving a different or larger product, but this is avoidable."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Its good i just wish that the shopping cart could hold way more item's but it only holds 100 They need to make it to where it can hold as many items and we want.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's been a great experience so far. SHEIN provides one of the best platforms for online fashion shopping. There are innumerable choices. Quality of the products is amazaing. It offers you the best deals. The system of earning points & to use them during checkout is great. The opportunity that SHEIN provides of joining outfit constests & to get them featured is something i appreciate the most. I have been very satisfied with it's services and would definitely recomend that you give it a try.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love it already and placed my first order today. So many positive reviews on the apparel. Cant wait to get mine express! (will return to review more after order arrives) Edit: Everything comes back perfect. Minus one item because I didn't measure right. Otherwise, know your measurements and you won't have a problem. The points definitely accumulate fast if you check in daily, I've had over $50 in points altogether. I shared with a friend and she loves it too."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I NEVER RECEIVED MY ORDERS AND THEY TOLD ME THEY WILL GIVE ME A REFUND AND DIDNT. I WANT TO GIVE THEM 0 STARS BUT IT WONT LET ME THIS APP IS TRASH AND SO IS THEIR CUSTUMER SERVICE THIS APP NEEDS TO BE SHUT DOWN.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's sad how almost all of the models pictures are photoshopped. I was looking at swimsuits and one of the pictures show the model with a slim normal sized waste and when I swiped for more pictures it showed the exact same model but with a very very large waste that did not even match up with the picture. I want to see how the product will look in person not how it would look photoshopped on a woman that looks beautiful as it is.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the style as a plus size girl, the materials are good. Fast shipment"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Way too many sales notifications you can't turnoff. Very annoying, it dings 24 /7"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The last few orders I never received. I tried to reach out to customer service to no advil and I couldn't get passed the bot system they have. I wasted my money and points! I'm really upset!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Did not received my order, contacted customer service multiple times, after so many attempts got through somehow, requested a refund, got a mail your refund has been initiated you will receive you money within 10 days, it has been one month now , still haven't got my money or any response from shien , looks like a scam....."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"DO NOT sign up to this with an email you use for other apps!!!! Every app I've used the same email for has been hacked into; spotify, instagram... you name it! Please be careful as I'm still unable to use my Instagram and had some difficulty getting my spotify account back! Other than that, it's easy to navigate and order off the app. Clothes are hit or miss, but that's expected with the price! Though, it is difficult to send things back..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The underwear is my favourite. Prices are really low but the fabric is so soft. If only they had proper bra sizing rather than small medium and large then it would be perfect. They have such a vast range of clothes at great prices and although it takes a little longer to arrive it seems worth the wait. You also collect points which you spend as £ by leaving reviews, signing in to the app or designing your own looks with the clothes and accessories encouraging people to leave likes 4 points."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"As long as you read the reviews on the items and pay attention to the description and measurements, you can get some really good stuff! I have basically redone my whole wardrobe. Plenty of cute stuff to wear to the office, church, out with friends, the beach. They have it all and the app is super easy to use! Shipping isn't as quick as Amazon but your package still comes within the time it says, sometimes sooner than that. Returns aren't as easy as Amazon either but still mainable."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love this app it so cheap and so many deals even has clothing and it's all real !!!!!!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein! Every single piece of clothing I've ordered completely matches the image and fit perfect. I've got a broader body for a woman and a wide ribcage and pelvic bone, but a lot of the clothing offers a bit of extra give so it doesn't feel like I'm suffocating. And, the low or no shipping is great. There's a lot of deals on it all the time, and a lot to offer. I recommend it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It's better than others but not the best. Most of the items are made of cheap materials and don't last long. The sizing is really weird and isn't very accurate. It also takes forever to get your items even if you pay extra. It's also not accurate with the delivery time and not specific enough. The plus size clothing isn't nearly as nice as the regular clothing.they give you coupons but they're basically useless because you have to spend at least 60 to get 15% off.the coupons should be easier.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"App is great, it's easy to navigate and I like that it gives you options that are similar to what you're looking for at the bottom. The tracking could be improved- it gives you a tracking number but doesn't tell you what company is shipping so you have no idea where your package is, and their updates are slow. It said package delivered 2 days after it showed up"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The quality of their items has come up so far in the past few years. It's still hit or miss, and you have to use the size chart and reviews for each item to see if it will work for you, but as for inclusive sizing SheIn is doing amazing. I'd say I get 1 bad fabric quality item out of every 10 that I buy. Im a size 3x or 22 and I usually get a 3x or 4x in everything. I've only had 1 item that fit more like a 2x and a few items that fit but were poor quality. Definitely recommended for plus sizes."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Wish there was a way to edit reviews once you've had chance to use the products properly. The search bar can be a little unhelpful at times too, as need to be very specific in what you search to get the results. That being said, I LOVE SHEIN!!!!! Had 2 orders from them now and the quality of everything I received has been remarkable considering where it comes from/the price"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Am I A Shopping Addition?! The answer is yes! Shein has become the most convenient & fastest way for me to search for my style of clothing with the touch of my finger. There are hundreds upon hundreds of options to choose from. Not to mention the cute selection of pumps I've recently purchased. Quit spending hours roaming at in-person store with limited options. Shipping is fast and sometimes even FREE! There are always discounts offered believe me. This app is perfect for all ages 😁
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"App works amazing! Love how you could add as much as you want to your wishlist but do recommend make separate lists , as it is hard to find exactly what you favorited. Kinda upset that from time to time certain things aren't in stock for example toddlers belts were once in stock and now I can't find any , as well as shoes ..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I absolutely LOVE Shein!!! The sizes are slight off in some cases but you're allowed to return item to get better size which is awesome! *1st suggestion would be allowing users to follow their friends. I would love to surprise friends with gifts from Shein that I saw on their wishlist. *2nd suggestion recycle more of your items. Some are sold out and never seen to return :( The cost of items and delivery time is superb! I driveline told and showed my friends & family about it! They joined too!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been pretty happy with most of my purchases. But things can be hard to find after a 1st look if you don't click the heart to save it. I wish they'd add categories for saving things instead of lumping together. I do wish they would quit letting people do those nonsensical reviews just to get points... Such as posting song lyrics, a bunch of symbols, etc. And adding a thumbs down option for reviews would be great. But otherwise, I order from them fairly regularly and will continue to do so."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Its not the same anymore. The app about is save money but I can't save anymore because of the update the points is lowering, when you want to purchase something and you use your points it doesn't help anymore due to limit of points you use when you purchase. 😭 YOU'RE NOT THE SHEIN I KNOW, THE SHEIN I KNOW IS I CAN SAVE MONEY WHEN I BUY BUT NOW?!!!! I CAN'T ANYMORE."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is brilliant and the best fashion retailer out there, in terms of price and value. The quality they offer and the low price shipping aswell is not matched anywhere else. Obsessed is not even the word! I adore it. The app is super easy to use and it has everything you need. I especially enjoy the check in points and the free gift when you spend a certain amount. Great perks. Thank you for your continued high quality and service and always doing right by the customer."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Navigation of the app is simple & straightforward & the similar suggestions below are fab! I love the review's so able to see real life images! Saying that a more descript universal sizing system would be better as i fit 2xl to 5xl even in jersey/ stretch fabric can be vastly different! Then I'd be more confident in buying. The postage/courier option could be improved as I've waited 4-17 days & the postal rates difference is crazy!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Clothes and everything is good but when it comes to diamonds they trick you or make it harder once you are so close to claim your prize ..
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"One of my orders didn't come in, and it's been about 6 f##king mouths, I deleted this app, never buying anything from it again 😡🤬"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The experience is good with the app, it would be handy if there was an option in reviews of an item to clock on comments with photos with them. So you're not scrolling down through reviews looking for a photo. The help with the app isn't the best. If you're having issues processing an order that bot chat isn't helpful at all. I've had difficulty 3 times with the app paying and had to go via website to pay."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Great collection at reasonable prices but a terrible user experience. The app isn't very friendly in terms of connecting with customer care. There was an option of chat earlier which has now been replaced with automated options which don't always serve the purpose. The customer service on call is also poor; you've to wait for a long time to connect and the executives also don't seem to know their job well. Also I don't understand their return policy: either self ship or pay for pick up service.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Tons of sales and app is easy to use! The prices are great with plenty of promotions going on simultaneously. You actually get what you ordered and the quality befits your expectations. It's a great resource for finding the cute, but expensive things you see on Amazon and FB at a much better price point. From housewares to lingerie this is a one stop shopping game changer!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"My main gripe is how tacky, overpriced, and cheap looking all the men's clothing is compared to women's clothing. Hard to find a unisex type of fashion on this app. A lot of the designs just look poorly made, usually have typos in their graphic tees, and straight up don't make sense sometimes. Reminds me a lot of Wish clothing, honestly. But that's fast fashion for you. A lot of the clothing items I've gotten from this app don't last very long without tearing or coming undone."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app so far. The products that I've purchased have all been really good (mainly clothing) I strongly suggest that you check what material the item is beforehand, other than that I would recommend this app and store, especially if you're on a tight budget, looking for bargains etc."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Several time I purchased items from shein try to make payment but it got cancelled many times..used normal banking but it goes straight to waiting for payment page in shein webpage status order, so disappointing"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"There's something very fishy going on with the games. If you're a regular user of the app I've noticed that it will block you out of the games. It is almost like they know you'll take advantage of it, so they prevent you from playing. That's highly illegal. Anytime I get active on the app, it tells me that I can't play any of the games. I contacted the company. They have been unable to tell me why this happens. Suspicious, and I right?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love SHEIN and their App is great. Orders arrive fast and I have never received an order that was missing anything. Quality of the items from SHEIN has always been top notch. No problems as of yet and I have been shopping with them for about 4 or 5 years. Thanks for a great alternative to all of the high prices that are out there..
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Thank God for Shein; because I get to shop for nice items that I would have to spend a fortune for somewhere else. My goal is to order at least one or two items a month so that I can stay in touch with the latest trends. Take my advice, and stop spending so much money on the same items you want that you can have without breaking the bank."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have heard so many great things about Shein. So I decided to give them a try. My experience has been horrible. I placed an order a week ago with no activity on it to date. It constantly says processing. When I try to use the chat feature it won't show me the largest part of my order so I can inquire about. My family members placed orders after me and have a shipping confirmation already this is ridiculous. I honestly don't think I will be purchasing from this company again.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The variety and range of clothes available is great, however, i haven't seen worse services than theirs. I placed an order fir a dress for my bday, and the delivery was cancelled right before then. The delivery was cancelled again after I re-placed the order. Do help for this is supposed to be a great platform for fashion but what good is it if your products don't reach the consumers?!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely LOVE SHEIN! Listen, I like online shopping just as much as the next chic, but shopping on Shein is an EXPERIENCE!!! Sure... Sometimes they're not spot on with what you're expecting but that's ok! Because their return process is so simple. The options are endless, the style is fantastic and the many reviews help with alot of my choices. I just honestly haven't found a shopping site more affordable and lovable."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Great clothing and accessory choices but the app is interfering with my phone's capabilities and it's frustrating. When I try to screenshot within the app, it states that I cannot screenshot due to security policy. Not sure I can understand why, since it's just a shopping app... but sure. But when I close the app, and just try to screenshot other things, even such as my homepage, it states the same thing. I had to uninstall it and reset my phone to bring it back to normal. Please fix this."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"So much choice! It used to take a while to arrive but that has improved. However, if you need it for an occasion that is soon order everything well in advance. Dresses are more miss than hit as the material is often not good quality and sizing is difficult. Also, it doesn't always suit me, (I have large breasts). The swimwear is great and t-shirts are usually good. Returns are easy enough and you no longer have to wait too long for a refund. And it is cheap as chips."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is nice. The only issue I have with this app, is when scrolling through clothing search, and you select a item to view details, after viewing item and returning back to search list. The search list returns to the top of screen even though you may have been far past the beginning. I would suggest improving the app to continue search where you left off."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shein's great and so are the prices! The plus size section is nice because it's not ugly ol' granny clothes. It's fashionable, cute, & sexy. I took off 1 star for the return policy. They only cover the 1st return. After that, I think it's like $7.99 per return. Even Amazon covers returns! Also, lingerie isn't returnable. I get why, but things can fit differently, so u may get stuck with something unwearable. Maybe a type of shield sewn in or tape that must still be intact to be returnable."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is really busy. Also when I choose the filter and I select 2 or more size options, the number of items available decrease instead of increasing. That doesn't make sense to me. My friend had to show me where to check in because it wasn't in an obvious location. It should just be front and center. Also, flash sales tend to exclude the curvy section a lot!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love the choice of clothes, the fact you can check it in all colours and they give you additional pictures of the back of the clothes so you have a great idea of what the item is like before you order. Great idea to point you to the accessories ( shoes, bags, hats etc ) in the images, great for someone who may struggle with adding the extras. Love love love, could spend a fortune on here. Haven't tried the homeware stuff yet but planning to soon."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Well, as much as I've had a relatively good experience with this app. The packages come fairly quick and all. The only issue I have with it however, is that they don't give you a po box number input option for shipping. Which in my case means I have to wait for a call, although I'm not always at my phone so I miss it and i have anxiety which makes it hard to call back. It would just be really great if I didn't have to go through all that trouble. It's making me want to delete the app"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I can't rave enough about the Shein app. Very user friendly. Easy to navigate, and extremely engaging, whether thru their contests, games, live videos, or daily check-ins, etc. Not to mention the selection of products they have ranges from clothing to home goods and even pet accessories, and all at affordable prices. Shipping has been phenomenal, tracking is accurate, and my shipments always arrive early and well packaged. Shein has birthed a brand new shopping addict in me and I love it!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Updated- The discounts have been tanked completely. It really stinks. --- I am a fan. It's a great app- easy to use, clothing is as described. You definitely should read reviews on items because some stuff is cheap garbage, but overall my selections have been great. And I've selected a lot lol. My only suggestion is that if Shein styles items together in a photo, provide links to the other items. This is mostly not happening although it does happen occasionally. I hate having to search around!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I was surprised to see that Shein has a lot more than clothes and a large variety of sizes. Good quality items for cheap prices and free shipping is all I could ask for! Also its more than a shopping app. They have competitions and other things you can participate in to get points and ultimately money off of your next order. I'm in love with the home items and cant wait to buy some more. Definitely give Shein a try if you're in to home decor and trendy outfits😊
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy this app, but I don't appreciate the unrealistic models they use. Not everyone is curvy. Be more realistic, please. Second, it'd be great to have an option where we can shop for specific seasons. Example, since it's fall, I'd like to be able to shop for fall items, and not worry about coming across summer/spring clothes. Third, sometimes, the clothes are NOT what they appear to be. I got a dress and a blouse that looked so comfortable to wear, but when I got it, felt like plastic. Fix it"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Mostly-for-women fast fashion. The best most intuitive app I have ever used. Also they sell for kids, men, maternity, kitchen wares, beauty accessories, household, roomstyle, makeup, pet items and even pet clothing! You can find almost anything in different versions and varieties. Descriptions are clear, reviews are plentiful. There are promos, livestreams, games, and chances to win points which equal dollar amounts for purchases. Shipping is easily trackable. I haven't tried the makeup."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Within less than an hour of using the app I've encountered an issue that really botheres me. I'll find a piece of clothing and in the pictures there's a matching top/matching bottoms for it and I have to SEPARATELY search for it. Sometimes I can't find it at all. It would be easier if shein had a link for the other matching item when you look at it. Maybe just above the recommendations.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Shein point system is a scam now. They limit the use of points very low even you buy extremely expensive products. I wanting to buy a 800peso product but I only can use 400 of my points. Bring the old system back.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Their service is miserable. Delivery takes a very long time and the material of the clothes is very often not at all as is shown. Moreover, one of my orders was ""lost in transit"" for which i was awarded 100 points; that was the good part; when i went on to use these points, the app crashed somehow and my order wasn't placed, and lo and behold, all my 500 points also went missing. If i could give less than a star, honestly, i would've."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The app is easy to use for the most part. Sometimes it can be a little cumbersome to navigate between things or find certain categories. Its nice that the app has suggested categories that are relevant to the current season posted on the first page. The new ads that appear when you first open the app are kind of annoy. Great way to market I guess but I rarely find them useful so its more if a waste of a few seconds.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Wonderful experience, you always get what is shown. Good quality, trendy, and affordable. Shein has an easy return policy and customer service is always on point. Great point system where points can be added to accumulate and purchase items. From the largest to the smallest item, Shein has something for everyone and home products too. I highly recommend Shein, they've never let me down, great for your shopping experience."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very nice items, but some are going out of stock too fast, and some are surprisingly a little too pricey. And you have to check the reviews first, because some of the items are very cheap-looking or don't look like in the photos. The help center is confusing because of the bot that answers automatically, but if you can get a real representative to help you, you might have a better experience."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"One of the best shopping apps I have ever experienced. The range of clothing is amazing and it quickly locks on to your preference and gives you more options. It also shows you reviews of what you want to purchase with photos of customers wearing the item to give you a realistic view of how it may look on you. Just made my first order, I cannot wait to see how it turns out."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good app with some nice clothes, customer service generally quite good when there is an issue. Clothes sizing however, is very hit and miss and the clothes tend to be on the small side, even within the plus section so quite hard to shop. Also, hate that when you get your items and go to review, it shows you how much they have now been reduced to, so you feel you spent double what you could have."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Absolutely love this app they sell clothes microphones air buds nail decorations table clothes shoes snd more you should really check out this app it's amazing and everything is always very affordable. And then shipping it's always very good most things I order come a week n a half but it does depend on where you live.but shipping is very good much better than Ali express I would like to say I find the fraud department quite interesting
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I buy from shein all the time. Items always arrive way quicker than anticipated. They always have discount deals of 10-20% depending on what you spend. The secret is to buy items based off of the photo reviews that others post on the app so you know what you are getting and how it looks in person. I have never had an issue with any items I have received. My only issue is not being able to stay off the app, I catch myself scrolling for hours on end. I definitely recommend!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Lovely clothes until you wash them. I have ordered a few times. The clothes look better in the pictures than the real thing. Most of the fabrics are cheap and very thin. Colour washes out quickly and the stitching is very bad. I just washed a dress I got recently and the belt fell apart completely. All the stitching just came undone and went in the bin. The shoes I have from there I've been lucky with. I am deleting the app and not wasting anymore money. Rip off
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Dont ever do their games! Theyre fradulent ways to spam your contacts. Theur clothes are cheaply made and about all if them are basically polyester and plastic. I dont tjink I ever saw 100% wool or cotton. PS... THEY ARE LIKE TEMU! CHEAP STUFF....NO CUSTOMER SERVICE! Their chat bots are USE LESS!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Apps are always convenience, right!?!? However the Shein app is really the best I've ever used for shopping honestly! So much so that I never use the full site, there's so need. There are so many different ways to search for items. Or you can use the menu to brows their different categories. Saving items to favorites is easy and checking out is a breeze. And their order tracking is great too. I highly recommend this app to others looking to shop on Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I want so badly to keep purchasing from here, but I can't justify the 50/50 chances of getting f**cked. 😫 when you order you really never know if the clothes are gonna look the same as the pictures or fit right, which is true for every other online site except ... these people have no CS. Like not that it's bad, it's non-existent. I tried to return some items, for a credit. They give a tracking # but it's stops tracking cuz it's been in transit since 4/28. ""Live chat"" doesn't work, so $40 gone."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Great phone app for the website. It is actually even easier to navigate then the website! Edit 6/16/22: The newest update has made the app function very poorly! Search filters take forever to work and they no longer show how many items are listed upon narrowing down with filters. I really liked that filter and now it's gone :( please bring it back!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I am new to Shein. so far I like what I see...The prices seem fair. I will update.after I ave used it more. HAPPY SHOPPING!!! Marcia
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"the most worst refer a friend game. It's a scam, they will never give you the voucher unless you invite a thousand friend"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've order twice using the app so far. I love it! I wish their labeling system was more organized (ex: all the holographic item come up when 'hologrplaphic' is typed, also similar/ same jewelry pieces in gold and silver are named differently) ither than that, they have really cute clothes for very low prices. Shipping has come early than expected on both of my previous orders."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have had multiple people download the website from my link and I never end up getting the free merchandise no matter how many times I do it
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Its a good shop. Huge selection of cool clothes you won't find anywhere else with prices that are hard to beat. Shipping is kind of flaky sometimes but overall not bad. The selection is vast and they regularly offer coupons and promos that save you even more. Just make sure you get clothes that are the correct size because returns look like they would be complicated. Other than that its a cool store. Definitely worth checking out. Bought a couple jackets and shirts myself and liked them alot!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very nice seller,it gives what you order and they have a good quality of merchandise..."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,everything was okay until there was no more free shipping and prices got up
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Perfect App and Details of each item.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Exciting shopping until it comes to deliver.... Shopping from Shein is fun, a big verity, sizes are true as indicated and the products are good and affordable. HOWEVER the couriers they make use off are pathetic!! Here in South Africa they make use of ""Third Party Express couriers"" like Skynet and DPD Logistics and they are anything but ""Express services"" The poor delivery services makes it less attractive to buy from Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The service I get is easy and simple
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's a really good app the stuff is cute but just not a 5. The deals r bad
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very nice collection, love the jewelry. Only 2 things :1) size charts are not accurate, there's a huge discrepancy between size chart and actual item.. 2) because of the inaccuracies of size chart, you may have a wrong size order and the exchange service is very slow, it's literally more than a whole month and I haven't received my items that I exchanged And frankly I blame it on the size chart!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My favorite place to shop. Great deals, super stylish pieces and the quality is fabulous for the price. They measure every garment separately, so the sizes are incredibly accurate. Free FAST shipping, I always get my item in a week or less. Free returns and they even email you the return label, so you don't pay any fees to return items. Literally the best!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a great app!!! Great clothing options for every occasion, everything from trendy to elegant at reasonable prices. They provide updated information on the shipping, tracking and delivery of your orders. I have purchased many, many items from SHEIN and have always received my orders quickly, in excellent condition and packaged well. I have never had a problem receiving a refund and I can't say that about very many other clothing/accessory apps. I am always confident to order from SHEIN."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Its an amazing app overall, it comes with great prices and has alot of stuff from room decor to clothes and essentials. There is just one flaw here, the quality of some of the items isnt good. I ordered a set of hoop earrings for example and the next day it broke. Also the clothes are way worse as what they look like on the models. Overall i rate this app 4 stars"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The range of clothes and accessories is insane, I've been browsing for hours looking at various hoodies, shirts, jeans etc and I can't help but want to buy it all, since it's being shipped from oversea the shipping time isn't too bad and the price range is perfection. The deals are on another level with regular sales and even vouchers that are sent out regularly. Whatever you need clothes/accessories wise I can guarantee you'll have a high chance finding it here"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app! Like half my clothes I've gotten from here. Was skeptical when first heard about it but tried it and now I can't stop lol 😂 I always get a ton of compliments on the clothes I get. Plus their sizing is easy to figure it the items usually say in parentheses the American size. Prices are super cheap. The only downfall is takes like 2 weeks for shipping but I promise you it's worth the wait and worth checking out!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Hi I placed an order on Oct preparing for Dec holidays but to this day I have not received it and on the App it says delivered. So I would like to know how to does that happen
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is very easy to use and what I love about it is it has reviews and pictures from real life people. Most apps or websites only show models wearing the outfit, this way you can get a more accurate conclusion of how you will look in it. I also love the way the app describes the material of every piece and what it's made from, how stretchy it is or isn't, and whether or not you need to hand wash it. Even returns are easy. And I love all the different ways you can accrue points."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Cool designs at decent prices, a few coupons available to newcomers. Shopping was easy with tons of options, and it works with many credit apps like Klarna. Best part is that you can by clothes or rent them and send some back to exchange if unwanted or sizes are wrong, great concept for an online store IMHO. Give it a try, possibly the only app I've given 5 stars. It's worth"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very good great choices and cheap clothes.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I get a lot of free coupons for doing basically nothing and the app is easy to navigate around. Overall great experience. If you spend a certain amount of money u get free shipping, if you spend even more you get free express shipping. Also if you leave reviews after buying a product u can get shein points which can be used to buy stuff for cheaper. Just be aware shipping takes long."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"SheIn is an awesome app! Lots of great sales, wonderful items! Communication is great, they let you know when your items are shipped and I've never had to return anything! One thing I would change is to tell more in the description of an item and measurements as in the make up bags. They're a very nice size, but measurements would be nice. Otherwise a great app and would highly recommend to everyone!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,All good everything is affordable @ shein and they do deliver in time i am 98% happy of all the orders i ordered in the past. I will still order more and more.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have ordered twice from this app. All in all the quality of the clothing is decent. The prices are literally perfect for the quality. Better than wish who false advertises prices. Here you get a good deal and Shein also applies multiple coupons towards your total. I have had 2 out of 43 items that I didn't like the way it fit on 1 and the second was very cute but very see through. I have more items in my cart right now! Can't wait for the next lot I order to arrive!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is really good in terms with clothes ,material , fabric and quality. I jus love the clothes from Shein I mostly purchase it online as there are more and new varieties and they look so pretty. FEEDBACK : prices for some items are way high than it should be , Flash sale sometimes keep repeating the same old clothes. Need some more discounts codes or coupons as such so that shopping is more fun 😊 overall 👌👍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely awesome and easy to use. I recommend you to all my friends. True size guide, comfortable material. New clothing all the time, very tempting to purchase all the time. Like your point scheme..just love this. Love your discounts. You guys are very creative in marketing so we can constantly be intrested. Like the hearts to click on to go back at a later time. Also would love to do your free trails on the clothing and other items. Easy to just click and buy. Some orders came 3weeks earlier"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My first experience was spectacular. Goods received earlier than expected. I am having challenges with my second order. The tracking app is very slow, doesn't show where my parcel is on time. I have to follow up with a call whereby I have to wait for 20mins in line and with them it's a different story after the other. I am frustrated"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I never have any problems with any of my orders and my packages always come in a timely manner in everything that I ordered is always inside the package nothing is too expensive really on the app it's all pretty affordable and if you have a problem with shipping delays or anything on set you can always going contact that someone from she in and they are very polite and helpful. So yes I love shein and I definitely recommend it! I would keep in mind the fact that some things run small.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Honestly I do love this app. I was super skeptical at first but I've always gotten my products and it all has been true to the photos. I do recommend buying items that have been reviewed, it can make it a lot easier in knowing if it is high quality or on the cheaper end. Sizing can be a bit funky so I'd know your measurements before purchasing any clothes. Some products are better than others, but if you want some fun and trendy items without going broke this is the site."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've gotten some great Shein purchases, it's usually good value for money, delivery is quite fast and clothes are usually lovely. The reviews and pictures section as well as the suggestions for similar clothes are very helpful. However the blatant ridiculous unnatural photoshopping of women's bodies, in particular their waists in so many of the images is very off- putting."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the app...it has everything from the clothes to the influencers & their vids trying on different outfits, to Shein's own brand of good quality makeup & how to put it on and look like a barbie doll. Lol! Only thing I don't like is the link in the text takes you to 1 page and when u click on it to open it up in app, you get an entirely different page!! 9/10 THE 1 ""thing you've been looking all over for, that matches so&so perfectly will be on that 1st page you not logged into."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Let me tell you something, I never rate apps, I usually just click the maybe later button like everyone else. But I honestly like shein, it has amazing clothes and beauty tools, a price great for teens and people on a budget, you get to see other people's reviews, and ships fast. Plus most of the time I love the things I order! But on the other the app has a confusing structure. I love there's no ads and I can shop in peace. So 4 stars"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Worst app.. quality is cheap and price is expensive. It doesn't have return option for my locality if they can come here for delivery then why not for pick up??????? First of all nothing is true to size. Material is very very thin . They told us earlier that if the product will be damaged they'll pick it up on their on cost but now nothing is like that.. they don't have good customer service . Every product's quality is not worth the price . Packing is very cheap.worst shopping app !!😡🤬
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This shein app worked perfectly for me. I had no issues. Fast, safe and reliable, its easy to follow, allows you to set your own country and currency which is perfect. You can track every step of your delivery on the app. Pages open up smoothy it also allows you to review products and has wishlist aswell... makes online shopping so much fun..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I LOVE SHEIN! App is easy to use and there are many affordable things on there, from clothes, kid clothes, kitchenware, bedding, beauty, jewellery and more! So many random but convenient things on there to make life easier lol. Oh and did I say affordable? There are some good quality, and some bad, but the bad you can always make look good for photos Amazing 10/10."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Just discovered Shein recently, and have since become addicted! The app is super easy to navigate, I love that you can see all the items in the order and follow their tracking in one place. The deals are unbelievable, and as a plus size girl, am super impressed with the availability of a plus size section and the product selection!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this game because everything is so cute I buy there for my 2 year old and she LOVES IT.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is great, love the clothes and they are trust worthy so far. Bought 3 times from them and delivery was successful. However would love if the first time buyer discount would not have a time limit because I was forced to make a purchase just so that I don't lose the discount. Maybe don't put a limit on that, some of us have to save money"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Shein is an amazing and easy app to use. It's has fantastic sales with the best coupons. Highly recommended in order to keep up with fashion and save money. Shipments are easy and fast. Also each item comes package individually. It's an addictive shopping app so enjoy shopping right now in the comfort of your home. Don't miss the experience of SHEIN.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After getting notifications and offers from SheIn several times a day, I tried to delete my account. But SheIn still sends me adds daily. I have navigated their website multiple times, and can't get the adds to stop. It's very convaluded as to how to make the texts and emails stop. They take you in a big loop, and then just when you think you've made progress, the screen goes blank. Please, just make it stop. Don't be dooped into giving them your info like I did."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Items have come as expected. Reading the reviews helps, leaving good reviews helps more! I love the items I've gotten though. You can find deals on free shipping frequently! Some times it is on all orders, often its on orders some variation of $29, $49, $59 or more to qualify. They offer frequent coupons and leaving reviews gets you points off future purchases. Anyway its been great. You get what you can expect and sometimes even better. I have enjoyed the experience."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have ordered several items from this site with no trouble so far! Had a few items that were smaller fitting than the size listed and had to return them. The only complaint I have is that they only refunded what they had the item listed for at time of return VS giving me back the full amount I paid. Other than that, I've had no trouble. Love shopping on this site. Items are good quality at very reasonable prices."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great clothes, Great quality, and great prices! Plenty of great options, sales, and finds! I have ordered for myself (a plus size woman) my husband(4x) and all four of.my children. We love the styles, materials, and colors. Shopping truly made easy and fun. The children love going to school stylish and original! Perfect app for all your closet needs!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely LOVE this app! The prices are unbeatable for the quality of the Shein clothing and merchandise. I haven't found any other store online that compares. They even have an amazing rewards program, too. Thousands of styles and options to choose from men's, women's, juniors, children, as well as makeup and home goods. They always have coupons and sales going on. Shipping is reasonable if not free. Definitely recommend it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My new favorite store in the world!!!!! Awesome quality, quick shipping, daily deals, unique and trendy, home and clothing, lowest prices for great quality! The daily check in program is so great!

Download now and get checking in!! I've ordered number products from them and highly recommend!!! :) Fabulous customer service! K"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is so easy to use. You can track orders, cancel them at anytime, and everything is organized into categories. Also, if you happen to close out of a item and forget to add it to your check out, them you can go right back in, and your most recent items are at the top. Lastly, I love the fact that each point is worth a cent. I got 100 points just for adding my email. I bought a couple things off of this app and saved $5! Everything has an amazing quality for a little price."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I deleted alot of stuff from my cart and the price stays the same.. Shein is a Scam!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shops like this are incredibly problematic, and I generally don't like to support them- but for a broke person like me, SHEIN is a lifesaver. I can get tons of cute and good quality clothes, and my favorite, quirky earrings, for super cheap- and even cheaper when you add in points and coupons. I absolutely love it! And the customer service is great."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Oh I can't talk about the quality of products since I never received them. But I can talk about the service and customer ""support ""- unbelievably disappointing. Takes ages to ship and work on the interface. And add reconfirmation window/pop up after selection of ""confirm delivery"". And it would be really great if you could provide functional tracking id instead of unvalid ones."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It is more reliable and easy to use ...less ads very acute I wouldn't mind being there for you guys as one of your member I am a greatest fan Keep up the good work
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Scam company. DON'T PURCHASE. This company is a ripoff and they use delivery couriers that do the same. I ordered items, and it's been WEEKS past delivery date, my items still haven't arrived. They were shipped with this scam company SpeedX, and there's absolutely no way to contact SpeedX. Shein customer support is useless, and impossible to contact. Do not order from here. You literally have a 50/50 chance of receiving your items. Look up reviews for SpeedX, that will tell you the whole story."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great app for clothing and home essentials. I use it mostly for affordable plus size clothing. The app is easy to use and I've never had a problem with any of my orders. In fact most of the time my orders arrive ahead of schedule. The app isn't misleading and you really do get what the description and photographs say. It's really refreshing because other shopping apps like this take forever on shipping and have poor quality items.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"My 12 year old daughter and I love Shein! There was a bit of a learning curve to get the right sizes of clothing, but that isn't an app issue, just the only ""con"" of the whole Shein experience. She and I both have wishlists we tinker with every day and we order as frequently as our budget allows. Ordering is easy. Navigation of the app is easy as a whole."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. It's very easy to navigate. It probably has the best dashboard of any shopping app out there. You can track your orders, see your sizes, check the status, customer service, reviews, points--everything all in one place. It's easy to navigate categories. I love the notifications it sends me on things I look at often. Their products are great prices for the trendy items I like to purchase without having to spend a fortune on something I may not wear forever but could if I wanted to"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"used to be amazing. Before there is actually estimated delivery time frame . Now it just shows shipping time 7-10 business days. This is very misleading. My current order has been processing for a week, my previous orders were shipped out in a day! At this rate it might be delivered 1-2months after.."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"My first order came quickly, quality of clothes was hit or miss, return process takes long. Second order had issues with receiving package and making exchange on incorrect items and returning some items that did not fit properly. Third order never showed, their system showed delivered but I never got it. I guess you will be ok if you are a first time customer - after that - you're on your own. I may order from them again but I'll definitely use my credit card so I can get a resolution for issues"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have had problems for nearly 6 weeks trying to place an order online.....there's always an error message. When I reached out for help, nothing was solved. I never complain about stuff like this, but I'm extremely frustrated about the situation."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"While the collection is good, the problem is associated with its shipping and customer service. The shipping takes awfully long, as in my case the item has been in my city since the last three days and it has still not been delivered. The customer care is abismal. The autochat option is redundant, basically gives you the same information you can fetch for yourself. The number doesn't get a response. And live chat is the only option available, how beneficial though, it remains to be seen."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love it. Easy to use and navigate, great contact with support as needed, wide range of products at variety of prices. Everyone who shops on Shein knows what they're getting - cheap stuff at a low price, but for the price, it's still pretty good quality. Wide range of sizes too, which is awesome, some clothing goes up to 5XL. The homewares are my favourite right now. My apartment is gonna be so cute when I'm done."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is pretty user friendly. The only things I notice that detract from the rating by one star are: 1. the checkout feature sometime double your items (example, I've had at least ten purchases where I rec'd two ct. Of an item (and was charged for it) but didn't select to buy the same item twice and 2. Sometimes the return feature will not allow you to select refund payment, it defaults to Shein Walket (in-store credit). Both areas seem a little suss to me since they involve my money!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is app is truly amazing. I first seen ads about it on Facebook and decided to give them a try. I was blown away when I seen the prices and products. When I first brought some items, the delivery came at a timely manner. Actually a week before it's estimated delivery date. And that's when I became hooked. I usually do fashion nova for online shopping, but their prices are getting a little pricey. These clothes look so amazing, and just wonderfully affordable. New favorite online store😊😊😊."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love it so cheap lovely stuff, almost everything for anyone. I just wish shipping took less time and that they sold things like shampoo/conditioner or nail varnish, etc. Very good line of makeup products also, a lot of different shades. Clothing good quality, lots of sizes and a few different brands. Have had very few problems, and there is a sale EVERY day. Things are so cheap and you can buy so much with discounts depending on how much you spend. Shipping is cheap too. I love this app!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! The clothes are super cute, very inexpensive, and I've gotten everything in a timely manner. Plus my first item I wasn't satisfied with, i got a full refund and got to keep the product. You can earn points different ways and use your points to buy products. The website is very easy to navigate, and o haven't had any payment issues. I 100% recommend SHEIN!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love the wide variety of products they have to purchuse ! Everything is super cute and fashionable and for the most part really kept up with any trends that are current . i think the price ranges and also absolutely worth the cost . your getting more for your money only thing i see could improve would be only that some of the few items are very cute but the material or product looks a tat bit cheaper than the pictures they have listed with is hardly that big of a issue honestly
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I love shein but lip products or any makeup product for that matter doesn't ship to smaller countries. Pls start to ship make products to smaller countries
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Amazing deals. Very happy with the items. If I don't like anything or it doesn't fit right I can return it and a full refund is given. Absolutely love Shein! So many cute work blouses with conservative cuts that look adorable. The app is easy to use and search. I wish there was a faster way to sort through sometimes but there's just so much selection that it's worth scrolling for a bit to find what you want that suits your style. Login everyday for points towards your purchase to save money!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,All I can say is that this is a perfect app where you can order your clothes.Thats why I give it 5 stars🤗
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You are decieving people with your promotional gifts you would almost make impossible for your customers to get. I did all but you would find a way to show it's remaining 0.08, 0.01"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If you keep your notifications on, prepare to be spammed back to back at all hours of the day or night. They don't care if you're trying to sleep or if they just sent two loud notifications in the last minute. They'll keep doing it. The clothing is super cheap and not always as listed, and a lot of the reviews aren't even on the correct item. That alone is suspicious."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Brilliant price. Really great service. Highly recommended. I only marked down the ads because you have to add the discounts on at the till - I was under the impression they were added automatically. But when you click on the add discount button they are all there for you to select from. So it's easy when you know how!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I like this app very much. All their products are very good. I am satisfied using their apps.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I Never have any problems with my orders, quick delivery. Love it!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Make sure you look at the sizing charts. I used models body size to make sure that it would fit me before I bought anything. I bought like 20 outfits and they all fit and look great. Not the highest quality items when it comes to stitching but none of that matters. The quality of fabric is awesome. The shipping was relatively fast. And everything was beautifully individually packaged. Great presentation, I will definitely continue to order all my lingerie from here! Don't missout on deals. Buy!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing! I buy so much from here and just can't stop! The only thing iffy is sizing due to being large I'm one size too big, so that's the only downside. But everything else is worth it. Since being vaccinated for covid I have had hair loss, been tested and nothing else would factor it, and I have been paranoid about my huge bald spot. The wigs are cheap, look real, and really hold up for the price, have more in my wishlist. Best price for common and unique things, defiantly worth look at😊😊😊"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is really engaging and easy to use. However, I am not happy with the fact that Shein doesn't post all the reviews and/or the pictures that the clients have uploaded. This way it is very hard to tell if a product is worth purchasing because more often than not the actual products don't always look exactly like they are advertised on the app. Also searching needs to optimised."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's amazing with affordable items that caters to different needs for ever individual.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great prices, but you get what you pay for. Looking at customer reviews and review photos is very important as the quality may be less then pictured, and the sizing varies by item so make sure to always check product measurements. Overall better then Amazon has been lately (garbage quality, fake photos), and I've been happy over every careful purchase."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've never had an issue with this app. It's cheap stuff that gets here on time. The app works well and so I give it full stars.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I LOVE SHEIN! This has become one of my absolute favorite apps! I've been purchasing a majority of my clothing through this app for months now. The app always functions well with no issues. The clothing is affordable, of great quality, accurately displayed on the website (what you see is what you get). Shipping is reasonable. Many items arrive earlier than scheduled. I just love it. I highly recommend!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Clothes are deceptively cute on the model (none of which are ""plus size"", despite being labeled as such), yet are cheap, thin, and dishonest (literally misspelled) at times when you get them. Customer service will lie despite sending screenshots to them and will disconnect rather than make it right or investigate further. All in all, inexpensive and you get what you pay for, I guess."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The first order went through well, however the second order took forever, then got cancelled by Shein without warning or explanation. I would have been able to reorder, but now would have needed to pay 20-25% more than the original order. I contacted customer service but the answers were all around why everything would be more expensive, no explanation why the order was cancelled without consent. Very disappointing. I give 3 points because of the first order, size being accurate and the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've had both a fantastic yet frustrating experience with Shein. Fantastic in that there's a satisfactory variety of clothing I like, however, when placing orders it's a major turnoff for me as I'm required to notify them with every single order that it's actually me using my card and request that they not cancel my order. Even after doing this, my orders are still cancelled and I have to re-order. This discourages me from continuing doing business here. Fix this issue please. IT'S ANNOYING!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I brought something from her and it was out for delivery and my stuff got back in cart but I did not get all my money and I only got a little bit of my money back
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein, I have placed almost 10 orders already & have only had the app for about 4 months. It's easy, convenient, wonderful prices & most items are really good quality too!! Delivery time takes a while but hoping since the holidays are over it doesn't take quite so long. They have flash sales every day, you get multiple coupons, and you can earn points to put towards your purchase. It's absolutely my favorite clothing app, I use it on a daily basis. Highly recommended!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I don't recall a single purchase that I ended up regretting,. Was of course skeptical at first but all my purchase thus far have been of an excellent quality, therefore absolutely no complaints on my end. Plus, really can't beat some of these prices. From clothes, to household items, to kitchen supplies your use to find something worthwhile. I will however advise to look at other reviews to get an idea of other buyers opinions."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Idk what to say about the company itself yet. You get alerts when there's a sale on an item you put in your like list. Very easy to navigate. Everything looks well put together. However, I placed not one but 2 orders on April 22nd. One has shipped but has not arrived and the other one is still processing. The payment have both went through so why is this still processing idk. Why can't I track where my clothes are at... idk. My order from Rainbows came in within a week and a half of ordering."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,They are really one of the best online stores out there. The only thing I wish is that you can return items from separate orders as long as it's in the time frame because the return shipping is hire or even sometimes the exact price so u kinda miss out there.. I order back to back n wanna to return but it was separate so that's $16 to return 2 items. So that's my only issue. But other than that they are great.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Stop deducting points .. I am thinking to stop buying from shein .. it worser than before .. Before was my best app .. these days are back and not helpful at all
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It was horrible I cancelled my order and they gave me half of my money back I spent 27$ and they only gave me 3$ back wouldn't recommend
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It is a pretty good site for affordable clothes, and the afterpay is definitely a bonus if you don't want to pay for a lot all at once. The only issue I have with this app is that I noticed some of the models are photoshopped, and because of that, I've had clothes that fit wrong. For example, I've had small/medium pants fit like mediums/large even tho the model is smaller than me and was wearing a small. Should be more like dollzkill, I don't think they photoshop their models."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,My fiance and I have been looking at various items on the SHEIN's app. And the price for the quality of the apparel is absolutely Outstanding! Plus the fact that there is a complete line of plus sizes in every category is Absolutely Fantastic!!! We are both Highly Satisfied with our experience with the SHEIN's app. I have bought many additional items for my fiance from SHEIN'S since my previous review. I am so impressed with the ease of ordering. This app is the Best!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great App, love Shein! The product range can be overwhelming but you can narrow your search right down using lots of filters which really helps. I love that there are garment measurements given for each size too - really helpful. The only thing I don't like is that you have no idea how quickly your order will arrive as it gets splits down into multiple packages, some come in a couple of days and some take two or three weeks to arrive."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The products are hit-and-miss. I've received items that I really love, but I've also received items that were really poor quality. Shipping isn't terrible, although larger orders may be charged custom fees. always make sure to read the reviews and check the size chart for every item you're interested in. Do not just order your regular size."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,My experience has been great since shopping on this site. There are two men gifts I am missing and may order them after Christmas holidays... it doesn't matter when they get them just as long as they get them.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Had trouble with many of my packages with delivery and getting my refund. Horrible tracking with parcels and more, I would rather temu than this."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Literally the best app! Gives me coupons every time I open it, positive reviewed adorable things for really good prices and has almost everything you could think of in pretty good quality. Only one bad part because I've heard some things like packages don't show up. But in my experience SheIn has been wonderful! Wonderful quality. Wonderful costumer service. Packages arrive. I got what I ordered. The items are identical to the photos listed and the size of the clothing I purchased was as listed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is the first time i am criticizing an application. Other than few glitches, i have never had such severe trouble with an online service as i have had with Shein. I strongly recommend choose any online shopping app but not Shein. Ordered two items, one was not what was in the picture, request for return, they picked up the top, but never refunded for it. Despite exchanging several mails. After few mails, they stopped responding too. Shein is so openly robbing customers. Very disappointing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I was buying from the Emery Rose website and it was a little harder to navigate but the app is much easier. The only thing that should be on both is the ability to add an item to the cart without actually clicking on the item which was available on the Emery Rose site.. I have only purchased jewelry and so far they have all been great except for 2 rings...one was very bent and the other was broken at the welding edge.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Everything is such a great price and great quality. There are always sales or coupons available that make it that much better. Its easy to keep track of your order and the reviews on each item are always super helpful. The only thing that could use improvement is how you insert the measurements as a reviewer because the sizes vary and aren't always the most helpful because the measurements available aren't used when buying clothing.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The application is very good, but why is the delivery feature not available to Algeria? I searched in most applications for delivery to Algeria, and indeed I found them, but there is one thing that is the worst thing, which is that they do not even deliver to Algeria."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Wish they did honest comparable sizes to US sizes. UPDATE 2023: HATE the UI on the app. So polluted and unorganized. The desktop website looks better than the app. They should downsize the number of open categories and to a drop-down tab instead of having them shoved in your face.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Shein claims to offer you free gifts under false pretenses. When you play their game, they tell you to invite someone to download their app in order to qualify for the free gifts. Then, once you invite the person and they sign up, Shein tells you to invite even more people to sign up before you can get the gifts. Even if more people sign up with your special link, they never actually send the free gifts. I should have known it's a scam."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"TL;DR: This app is totally worth getting! I was skeptical about getting this app because I have heard bad things about apps like Wish, but this is nothing like that! The orders can take a while to come in, but usually they come in early. I really like getting jewelry from SHEIN, because there is literally nowhere else you can get great quality unique earrings for $1 or $2. The clothes can be cheap quality, but it just depends on what you buy and how much the item is. Overall, great prices!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really like the app there is a lot of variety and options for the user. There are some clothes which are priced a little higher.A small suggestion on the return policy it would be great if you can improvise on this I wanted to return a top but I really liked the top so the only reason to return it is because I ordered a size small but still it is loose for me. so instead of returning it and then reordering it, it would be best if there was an option to exchange the top instead of returning it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very hard buy they get it rong lot off times ...try again
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The App works great, my only issues are in the search parameters & the wishlist feature. They need to make a tab in Wishlist so that you can separate the items you've already purchased(but may want to buy again) & the ones you've yet to buy. This way you don't gave to scan tons of pages to look for saved items. Also, the general search has tons of filters, but is overcomplicated & doesn't always show the proper corresponding items. Otherwise the App is easy to use & their return policy is great."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've only ordered once (diff device) but one thing to say is that it's extremely affordable. The item I'm trying to get, finger armor ring, is cheaper on here then it is on wish. The items are super cute and easy to find. Not to mention, the buying system is also easy and quick. So if your looking for a shopping app, you've found it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is so easy to use and You get more discount offers. I've never had any issues ordering or deliveries and I love their clothes. Always true to size and good quality. If you want to see what it looks like on real people scroll down on the item and check out the reviews. If you leave reviews yourself, you can get points to redeem money off your next purchases. Fully recommend and better service than most companies in the UK!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Poor service. No transparency. Out of my r1300 order I was only happy with the deck of cards. Tried to return few items. Was already upset that I'd have to pay to return them ,they never picked the stuff up anyway. Wanted a full refund on my order but the don't do that. I will never recommend the app or store to anyone"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So far I haven't been disappointed. At start, it was hard to match sizes. Now that I have shopped with them for some times, I don't have issues choosing the right sizes. The material, the selection is easy and prompts for suggestions for items not displayed works good too. The app is easy to use and I love how effective the delivery is especially for VIP customers and the coupon system is brilliant. Keep up with the good work."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Points is useless because the items that you've ordered was still so expensive
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is really good, good items, prices and deals but the only things i think they can fix are: 1) Allow us to select what we want to pay for from the cart. I always have to send some of the items to the wishlist in order to make a payment for the items i have pickep. 2) Allow us to change the size of the items after making the payment if they haven't been shipped yet."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The sizers are off, the large is closer to a medium especially the tops and jumper I ordered. I was disgusted with the amount of plastic covering every item!! Seriously do something about the plastic. It's so unnecessary. The quality matches the price of the clothes. I kept a few items but most need to be returned."

I replaced a 59$ order and pressed checkout butten to pay when suddenly it wrote that total amount was 80$, totally different amount. As it appeard in 2 seconds all the prices got changed, i don't know how that happened, but it really made me upset. I hate such things and i'm very dissapointed, so, i don't think that i'm gonna use this app anymore."

Such a great app I'm delighted and shipping is like 2-3 weeks which is much quicker than similar apps:)"

Shein send items within 2 to 3 weeks. You can track your order until you receive it. Return anything at one time from a single order for free. One free return per order. I like the discounts. I like the points I can build up daily. I like reading the reviews for clothes I would like to buy. So I can see how clothes fits to order either bigger or my true size. Thanks"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I'm waiting for my second order at Shein and I'm really satisfied with the service. On my first order I did choose inexpensive items just to try my size and only one item is a bit larger than I expected. I like that they send the info when the order ships and I can track the packages. My order came before the date expected and I really liked everything. The app is easy to use.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Too much ad's and always pop up
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I think shien is a brilliant app. Quick fast and easy delivery. Easy to use website. Love that you can look at reviews and see people trying the item on before I make the choice to purchase. The only downfall would be the sizing. Although sizing itself is great, I would love if they including the sizing in UK sizes also I.e. 10,12,14. Other than that the app is amazing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I order a lot from Shein, and I have not been disappointed so far thank goodness. I just rated it 4 stars, becuase I have a hard time reviewing their products. I hope we can review the product one at a time, because it really takes a lot of time if I do it on my orders all at once. I'm busy most of the time. Though, I love to do reviews, especially when I love a product, but doing a lot of it in one sitting is kind of a burden to me."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love shopping with Shein! I was really weary of ordering anything at first becos I thought the clothing would be cheap tat due to the low cost, but I eventually placed an order and not only did it arrive a lot earlier than it said it would, but each item was separately folded neatly into a zip up bag and the clothes were by far better quality than I imagined! A few of the dresses are a little see thru, but the right pants solve that issue. Sizing is pretty true to size"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The clothing is a decent price, some sizing is off but it is from another country, so I do suggest to read reviews. The best reviews also have their measurements listed. It helps to pick the size you need. I do reviews and always list my size. With some things including lingerie I suggest you try to size up. The bra sizing is off a little. So if you wear a medium go for a large. Overall it is great but points do expire so you do have to use them before you lose them. Happy shopping 🛍 ☺"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I really love how shein has fashionable clothes for many sizes including plus size!! Sexy younger trendy styles are so hard to find in plus size clothing so thankyou shein for this! I love the free returns! Literally the only 2 reasons I shop with Shein! However the downside is the quality of the clothing and and fabric used on most garments. Reading the reviews on each clothing item is very important and looking at what fabric is used which honestly takes a lot of time for me. Reason for 3 star
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Pretty good! It was a bit hard to find the costumer support button. But once I found it it was easy from there. Things seem to be well made so far and i like everything. The only thing i have a minor issue with is that I pay for fast shipping.... But it still arrives late or at the standard shipping time. Other then that. I like it. Oh... And i am kinda tired of all the notifications. I just want the option to see notifications only regarding to purchases.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Every time I order something, after a few day I get a notification ""order is out of stock"", but when I open the items page, it doesn't say that.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"As long as nothing goes wrong, it's good. However, if you need to return items or need assistance, it's nigh impossible to get help. Customer service is unresponsive on all platforms available, and return information given online is not enough to actually make the return. I'd advise everyone to never spend a larger amount of money at once on this site."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Not being able to speak to anyone about a whole order that was refunded, with NO EXPLANATION IS RIDICULOUS!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is kinda a lottery in terms of quality. Sometimes it is great in quality and other times, it is awful so it really depends, but you expect that with the low cost. I have managed to buy some wonderful products such as earrings ,wall stickers and dresses from here. There really is some for every women on Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The quality of your stuff can be hit or miss, but that's completely fair for the low prices. I've bought tons of stuff from Shein, like swimwear, accessories, room decor, even underwear. Never had any problems. It's a great app for cheap shopping. Just pay attention to the reviews to have realistic expectations of what you're receiving before you buy."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I don't like shopping clothes online because I have experiences wherein the the clothes are not exactly what is advertised and shown on the shop. But in Shein, the size, the designs, the fabrics are exactly what's shown on the product page and description. The style and fashion are also unique and you'll never see such awesome styles in different physical stores. It's also easy to earn points and rewards. The vouchers are always available to use unlike other stores."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,They will change the price of something in your cart.they show one price then when you get to your cart some items can be twice as much..you can shop at places like just fab for shoes that have a much better quality and not cheap materials..they misrepresent their prices
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I feel like This App is a scam because recently I had an encounter where I received a website from Shein saying it's an entry to a possible gift card of R5000 and I shared the website and Did everything I was suppose to but just to find out it was a Scam And They Almost took all of my Money from my Account. I had To block my Card immediately because of what They Did. They Deducted money without my authorization.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Some items have free returns and exchanges. They have a icon on the bottom left side that has coupons and will tell you what you can qualify for. Overall, they have some great items. The sizing differs here for me than most other sites. Check their sizing chart before you order especially on things that you can't exchange or return. We order quite a bit from both Womens and Mens and are overall very happy with our purchases."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love SHEIN because it's cheap and it still has clothes that I like and find cute, I also like the decor part of SHEIN too! They're very interactive with their shoppers; designing outfits for points and doing free trials for a winner to review! I will say though, the shipping takes a while, sometimes 2 weeks, but I guess I'd just have to be patient!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"SheIn is a really cool app with all the cute clothes and stuff but Istg it is so f'in frustrating when I'm writing taking pictures and writing reviews for multiple things at one and as soon as I click off of it, it all disappears. And the autocorrect duplicates words when you get it wrong instead of changing the word. It's just so annoying."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,poor very poor service I have been shooping from long shein last time which I have been buy and selected the clothes has not a same and when I sent cancel request its been more then 10 days but there is no responding
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Consistently surprised that I am still surprised by the quality of the clothing and other items like housewares. The app hasn't glitched and I've used it for over a year now. The algorithm produces results that match what you have bought or looked at last with good accuracy and the search field allows you to broaden the search with ease. Every time I wear something from Shein I receive compliments.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Better than expected, extremely impressed! As a larger lady, I was expecting a poor choice in plus-sized options, and for them to be ill-fitting and quite frankly, awful! I'm delighted to admit to being very wrong, the jeans are divine, the t-shirts are fabulous, and everything else is just amazing! I'm not only extremely impressed by the sizing and quality, but I'm blown away by the sheer range and choices available. If you've not tried it yet, do it. You really won't be disappointed!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent Shein. I'm a plus lady of a certain age but the clothing is brilliant. Some materials are a little 'shiny' for me (polyesterified) but if I really would not wear an item, they are cheap enough for the charity shop. I've found the plus sizes do come up larger but it depends on the item. Excellent delivery service - only waited more than 10 days for 1 item. Everything perfectly wrapped and arrives in perfect condition."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great store. I love the selection of clothing, sizes are pretty accurate (I use the Curve section) and only had one fault item I needed to return but it happens! Only down side is the wait time for deliveries but tbh with everything covid going on at the moment it's understandable. App is easy to use and layed out well. Will be ordering gain soon."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"READ THE REVIEWS B4 U BUY! I recently bought a whole load of clothes and accessories, keep in mind you get what you pay for, but trust the reviews! Some seem to not know what ""QUALITY"" is but its worth scrolling through to find the true & honest reviews. The clothes, although on the cheaper side, you can still find great finds, looks for a fair price, and it gets even better when there is a sale. Which so far, has been more than often!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This is disgusting shopping why for order delivery notice you cannot see item delivered takes email address? Phone number and too much ordeal just to confirm the item delivered. I am really turned off shopping on this site. Nice product but poor service
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This has been a most wonderful shopping and apping experience for the whole family !!! I haven't came across any issues and easy navigation. I am looking forward to continuing my online shopping as well as sharing the joy from the priceless times the family ask where did I find (( these gifts))!! Thank you SHEIN AND TEAM!!!.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,You get clothes for cheap prices! It is a bit of a gamble as if you order a few things there is usually something that is too cheap of a material or doesn't fit right but honestly for the prices it's worth the gamble to get a few great items! Def one if the better sites for cheaper clothing as long as you don't mind the long wait as the estimated delivery usually changes to late dates a couple times but you so always get your package!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Very good finds on here, but it randomly deselects items from my cart and doesn't add them to my order when I check out. VERY annoying, please actually let me purchase the damn items I put in my cart!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The customer service is just 2 stars...they delivered a wrong item and i raised the case 3 days ago, still waiting foe their response..should this be so slow?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The range of product on this app is incredible, and their plus size range too. It's like an entire shopping mall in one app, and the prices are wonderful. Yeah the clothing is a little on the cheap side quality wise but not much!!! The only problem I've had with their clothing is one stuck zipper (my fault) and one wobbly button. I love this site but the only problem is they can't possibly be sustainable, and that makes me weep. If you don't mind that though GO FOR IT :D"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love everything about this site. Very easy to buy and delivery is also fast. If you need something different this is definitely the site to buy. Love the trends and fashion. The size chart is very useful and correct. I've bought a few denim pants and boots and it was spot on according to the size chart measurements. So far I can not complain about the quality of the products. Everything I bought, jewellery included was true to pictures. Love the point system, it helps a lot. Totally in love!!!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's usually good, but recently it's showing alot of problems. The items that I order aren't delivered and then they refund the wallet money, but the money paid from upi isn't refunded. When I contact them, they say that it'll take sometime to reflect on your card, but it has already been a month. I have recently ordered a few items, if it isn't delivered to me and if not and the money isn't refunded, I'll uninstall the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The quality of the clothes never changes and they have a very good servicing skill
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm always skeptical when it comes to ordering clothes online, especially when clothes seems too cheap to be true. SHEIN has blown me away with its quality. It has since become my go-to for clothes shopping. I even prefer it over most retail stores. if your're trying to look good on a budget, I definitely recommend giving SHEIN a try. I was only ever dissatisfied with two purchases, and that was mostly my fault for not taking my own body type into account (swimsuits and pear shapes= hell)."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Cool clothes and things for a cheaper price. Things are pretty good depending on price range. For clothing just take your measurements and size based on that. Most of the things I buy fit well. Only thing is that the quality 8s not the best but also prices can be pretty cheap. Tue cheaper u go than quality goes down to. Overall is really Good!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They sent very late a package, I didn't receive it and they said delivered. They gave me in ""compensation"" 50 points ehich is basically 50 cents. Those were gifts fir a special occasion, so, timeframe is important. Also, I literally don't live there anymore, I moved out of the country. They sold faulted panties and say beforehand the product cannot be returned. Worst customer support"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Your customer service sucks it don't exist I just got my order and it wasn't what I asked for! They don't even have a phone number and that chatbot is defective
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Sometimes the clothes will look great, sometimes they're an absolute catastrophe. Wish the customer service was better integrated and more helpful"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was hesitant to order from SHEIN, but after my first order I was satisfied with the clothing I received. Personally, I love the styles and clothing but the clothing vary on quality but they are durable. If anyone wants to make a purchase I would recommend to review the reviews for each item, sign up for promotion email or messages to get the lowest prices, and always see if there is free return as they have for some order in the USA. I made a return and it was free, I got my refund back to my account which I paid from. I track everything to make sure everything I order and return have been processed, especially refunds so I glad that their refund process was done in a timely manner."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein has a very user-friendly app. The search filters help make it easy to look for the perfect item you are looking for. The items have separate categories too (i.e. dress, pants, loungewear etc) and even sections for what's hot and what has discounts. Using online payment methods also provide additional discounts to your total payment. The items are also very nice (I love all of those that I bought!). Thanks Shein!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Awesome store! Great prices! Tons of great items on the online.store.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I have in the past loved shopping from this application but I always read reviews and since I last shopped with you all and when I shop I mean 500 .Dollars I am hearing that all this Market place stuff is junk my question is that Facebook marketplace because I have never heard anything good about that so I am now reconsidering my order if the marketplace is Facebook marketplace because I've never heard anything good about Facebook marketplace so that's my question is that what it stands for ??
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have to say for someone on a budget, this store is amazing great styles for a price you can afford, I am a pretty large lady and for us plus sized queens this store is a great place to feel absolutely fabulous. For basic shipping no more then a week to 2 weeks, they also have faster shipping for a charge but with the coupons they give you. Its all worth it!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I think the rating system like for reviewing products, should be different. It's always standard 5stars, most of the people doesn't change the amount of stars. So there are a lot of products that are actually bad, with bad reviews but with high ratings. Also pictures aren't accurate. But it's cheap and easy Edit: it would be nice to see the other clothes that the model is wearing, or at least something similar looking. Also the prices are rising, but it feels like the prices are random generated"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the variety of different styles. I like to screen shot what I like and build crazy different outfits. The prices are awesome but the material isn't strong especially when it comes to these ""leather"" look alike items. I have recommended this app to different people abs they love it too. Adding a bit more quality touches would make the clothing even better. Also, more variety for the men's section is needed. I want to get things for my husband but the styles are on the ""boyish"" side."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I've been using Amazon for a while and they have pretty good options but I've never really been able to find clothes to match my style and I just download shein and I feel like I found a place to shop that fits me just right. shein always has the clothing style I'm looking for. and from what I know the clothes are really good material and high quality
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Too many ads on my other sites. Also, too many packages, that small items could be put into one package. Paying for shipping, processing is expensive. I bought a lot of products, and I feel like the rules have changed. Higher prices, and hard to return items, due to costs. There are some products that are supposed to give rewards, and codes....but they won't happen unless the consumer buys more products, higher in spending costs."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Genuinely brilliant. Amazing value for money and the clothes are amazing quality. I have bought a lot from here and 9 times out of ten the clothes are true trust to size and cut. I'm really impressed takes the stress out of shopping as you can add your size and style preference plus your measurements and they then will filter your searches which is really useful. The makeup selection is pretty good too. Definately recommend :)
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It could be better on the delivery time but other than that I love this app
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Tons of selection. Great clothes. Even better prices. Love it.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's not that bad. I suggest starting off with a few different items. One shirt hoodie blouse pant or something. The clothing is made by them so it isn't like labeled really. It has their logo on a tag and tells you the size. I'm a 3X and I buy a 3X and it fits good. The clothing is sometimes thin so don't let that turn you off from it. It's fashionable and super affordable. I've returned large orders just make sure you keep the bag & item together. The customer service can help too.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I never leave reviews but I love Shein. Easy returns, inexpensive clothes, and solid reviews/size help. I love that I can get so many unique pieces. Most of the clothes are under $10, a lot even under $5. I like the wishlist option, and they give you points for submitting reviews. They do free shipping over a certain amount. There's always coupons. Shipping can take a while, but don't forget that it's coming from China and can get held up in customs. Seriously can't beat it!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like this app, but the 80% off sale was very misleading. It included items that were not 80% off. Couldn't figure it out until I used my laptop. Noticed only one of about 10 colors was 80%. Who the neck wants three baby hoodies? Also the 80% off did not include plus sizes. That's unfair. Also the sizing sucks. You never know what you're getting. Praying my order fits. Other these items you can't beat the low prices. Shipping is quick."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"You get what you pay for but honestly, most of the time I'm genuinely surprised at the great quality I get compared to the low prices. I've never had a problem with the actual app itself, and it's always really fast and responsive. I also never ever get any ads from third parties. The ""coupon offer"" pop ups from SHEIN are a little annoying while I'm browsing, but it's usually when I first open the app so it's not too big a deal"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great service with a good turnaround customer experience. I have had successful orders that were good quality clothing. Based in South Africa, I generally receive my goods within 3 weeks and always before the estimated delivery date. The prices have gone up a bit, but it's still highly competitive for the market. Their clothing sizes do run a bit big, just to keep that in mind. The majority of reviews are spot on for the product you receive. Thanks SHEIN! :)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Been using for a while now. User friendly in terms of navigation between products & to contact customer services if you need assistance. Uses some form of profiling as provide ""you might also like suggestions which is useful if you want to compare items.👍 Would be great if easier to edit once order placed (I added 2 of the same items to my basket and didn't notice till I placed the order) not a major problem as customer service accessible & some of the sizing was easier to translate."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein, seriously it's quality, convenience and affordability all rolled up in one 5/5 really but they have chosen the wrong courier service where I'm from and it's a constant let-down."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have purchased something from just about every department. I've never had to return anything. I've Never had a problem so far. Shipping has been fast & packed well. Unbelievable the endless products you can find on here. The best prices & markdowns. Most of the time free shipping. The womans lingerie is phenomenal. Endless styles & sizes. Best offers & points awards. Shein is very addictive. I just wish I had more money.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Back into normal shein .when all points are max ... Way back 2020-2023 For everybody happy when shopping here at shein .
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Be very careful to check your personal measurements and the listed measurements of the clothing you plan to buy. Returns cost a minimum of $8 for each return transaction so if you need to make returns expect to take a good financial loss. You'll be covering the cost of shipping and all shipping materials back to their warehouse before even getting a refund. The clothes are good quality in my experience and very affordable. But it's fast fashion so just remember you get what you pay for.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have ordered 3 times from Shein in the last month (lockdown boredom!). Delivery was really fast considering where it was coming from. Great communication through the whole process. Products were brilliant. App is easy to use and always offers discounts. The only problem I have is that I am spending too much! Reviews on the app are great to help with sizing.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Everything comes quickly if not early. For the price of everything you can't go wrong. The quality is not top notch persay but definitely can't complain. You get what you pay for if not more. Easy to navigate for the most part and I have never ran into any bugs on the site while using it. Also the site has a rewards program which im sure will come in handy one of these days!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I would give 3.5 stars but that's not an option. This app is good for the most part. Shipping is usually early. The clothes 97% look just like the picture. And the prices are great. What makes it suck is the point system. You only get a penny for each point. They expire and you can't use all of your points to get anything ""free."" It only lets you use a certain amount of points. Which I think is stupid. They shouldn't expire and you should be able to use them all especially if they are only a 1¢."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I rated it a 3 because the shipping is so slow. If you need somsthing fast do not order from shein. It I great if you are planning way ahead if time and it has really cute clothes and other items I just don't like how long it takes to get yore items. I also don't like that every time I apply for the free trail center it fails. I do everything that it says to do and I still don't get it. I don't believe that they give away free things. And also the servey center has no serveys!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein! The app is great! It's really easy to use and split into categories. You can track your orders, use the wishlist for the clothes you just simply have to buy! The gothy range is amazing, and definitely my weakness! The range of styles across the board is awesome, with clothing of all styles. The prices are fantastic too 😁"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If there ws an option to rate it 0 i would have done that as well. Highly dissapointed!!😢 The item dont look similar in real as it seems to be in the website. Everything is of such cheap quality , the material is so transparent.. it is not true to size at all.. I ordered 5 items n none of them are worth. I need a return for all the items. The refund should be done to my personal bank account and not shein wallet. I have made a mistake trusting this app for clothes to wear it on my big day."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing prices, and the quality of almost every item my wife and I have purchased has been very good. I highly recommend using this app if you're looking for any sort of clothing as well as tons of various different types of jewelry and accessories. Their selection is huge and shipping is great too. Never too expensive, even for larger orders, provides tracking, updates, and always arrives pretty quickly for something coming all the way from Asia."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love the app, very easy to use and I much prefer using it to the mobile website. And, of course, the clothes are great! However, one feature that I would love to see would be the ability to create collections. I have lots of items that I have added to my wish list, and it would be great if there was an option to sort these items into groups (colour, summer clothes, winter clothes, etc) , for easier access."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this shopping app! It is my absolute favorite place to shop on-line! they have the cutest clothes in all different sizes, they have the cutest shoes and accessories and they also have a lot of home goods and accessories. Plus they have the best deals, with so many different fun ways to save money. Like, checking in every day, you can build up points that save you money off all of your purchases. They also have cute fun little games to play that also offer discounts.Shein Rocks!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love shopping here bcoz it's cheaper than other brands and there are variety of options. The problem is about the flash sales. Prices are very cheap but when you attempt to checkout items, the prices suddenly goes up. The vouchers are also scam because it will just add equivalent amount on the original price of the item you checked out then deduct it so it was like you dont get any discount from the vouchers. Might delete soon👍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The seems nice and user friendly but the customer service is very bad. There is no proper way to contact the customer service. They have bot and it allows you to choose some options. But it is very confusing. They reply very late. I already have disappointing shopping experience with them. Do not expect good customer service experience from them.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have yet to have a bad experience with Shein! It's definitely alot of buyers beware, as in making sure you are taking the time to read reviews of the products you wish to buy, and looking at the measurements, as the sizing of clothes can differ from each piece! I've only gotten a few things that were slightly too big and too small, but that's how I've learned to manuver the app. Shipping is wonderful, I have yet to return anything but I know they do offer that!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is so user friendly. The quality may be a but misleading but can't complain. The prices are so much better compared to the prices in local stores for the same item. The clothes are also affordable. And there is free shipping for items above a certain amount, so always target that. You also get gifts from certain games and points for reviews"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Packing was on came early and outfits fit great I will be shopping more often and they have great prices
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I shop SheIn mostly for their scrapbooking supplies. Out of all the competitors, they have the best prices and shipping is free if you spend over a certain amount with a coupon. I loved everything I got, the only downside is you don't get to choose which things you get out of a set of different colors/styles. They are randomly selected. I will definitely be shopping with SheIn again for more supplies."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Sizes vary, wish they were more American. Quality may not be as pictured so you'll likely return a lot. Reasonable prices, some good finds. Many outfits are way too skimpy and I'd never wear- should have a filter to exclude them. Sizes run small to average. Ok shop for casual wear. Takes a long time to deliver. You have one shot to return as they want all returns in one package. After that you're stuck with the order."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the app. Huge choice, mainly great prices. I enjoy the range of graphic TS. The 'find similar' option when something on the wishlist sells out is really useful. I also find the reviews really helpful. The only downside is having to separately tick different options on one item. Absolutely will keep using the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Keep getting onscreen notifications that say ""connect to network"" when i havent even been on the app and am constantly connected to wifi anyway. Almost everything for sale is cheap, which was fine for the cost but now alot of things are expensive which definitely doesnt match the quality. Cant access customer support in app. Uninstalled because it keeps happening even after removing ALL notifications again"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,To my items that I recently ordered on October 16th 2023 I did not receive because of some sort of this arrangement or something might have happened but I would like for it to be free and no fees because this is unacceptable behavior from shein and I really don't believe that a app this good that's been all around the world has made mistakes so I'm leaving a one-star review.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The clothes are cute and priced well. I orderd three shirts and and one was perfect, one too big and one still hasn't arrived over a week later. I ordered two skirts and one is perfect and they other must have been modeled on a six foot model, it is way longer than pictured. I have another order that has been ""delayed"", I likely won't order again. I have not been offered a refund on my way overdue purchase. When I tried to contact all I got was automated replies and no way to chat."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,literally love their products so much its cheap and good quality. the thing that got me was the adorable gift they sent for christmas <3
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The only thing I would suggest is that the website and app could have a better menu category system in place as well as the option of selecting an item in your favourites and moving them into a different board instead of having to unlike and relike the item to be able to move it to the board you want. Other than that it's great.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The products on this app are amazing but the customer service is very poor. Shipping charges and services are not good enough. Return and exchange procedures are very complicated and the manual service is of little help. The only reason i continue to use this app is the amazing variety of products. Would rate a 5/5 if they improved the customer services.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Hate shein lying app as soon as I'm about to win the game it suddenly stops working.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Half the ""deals"" are a scam including their new ""lucky draw"" which is rigged because everyone I got to create account in my family said the exact things happened to them. Specific draws and then saying they're one coin away. Scam"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Shein is awesome!!! I use it more than any other app. So many great deals.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,app installed via scummy ad. Probably malware/spyware.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Orders always true to size, provided that I checked the reviews and made sure of the measurements. Daily check in provides points that can be used as discount when you make your purchase. Orders have always been on time and all the products I have received until thus far has been good quality. Very impressed. The app itself is easy to navigate and user friendly. There are little adds. ( hate adds) Ordered from RSA"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The daily login rewards aren't worth it anymore. It's almost as if you're asking to remove the daily sign in
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There's just no way that we can connect with any of the customer care executive. I had ordered a top for Large Size, however, I received a Small size from Shein. I tried connecting on customer support, also tried sending them a mail. However, no response and I had no option but to return the top, but there was a deduction of a particular amount for pickup, whereas I wanted to replace for the actual size, for which there's no option"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It was AMAZING!There was a lot of things in SHEIN, there were clothes, phone cases, toys, stickers, led lights, decoration, bracelets, hair accessories, and many more things! I love this app. Most of the things there were CHEAP! U can put the things u like or want in a list and u can order it some time later, it will save it for u, but some things can get sold out. Some things will have a size or color so u can pick out either a color or a size! I love this app and i hope u love it as well !♡"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Before the update the app was stupendous. Clear concise hardly no lag now I'm having nothing but problems. Its slow in loading and thats if it loads at all. When I go to my me page it just shows a blank screen and freezes up. Before the update I would have given it a 5 with this update its a 2 and it would be lower than that if I didnt know how great the app was at first. Update: Shein has improved greatly. They have added more wig choices and they are great choices. Prices have gone up.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love the variety the cute clothes Some can be expensive but great sales. It takes a long time to get things but this time of year and with COVID what do you expect the games were good and so were prize but they changed and now all you get are clothes if you can even win. Not happy
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I don't have problem with the quality of goods.. it's just that it takes time for the package to arrive (it takes almost a month).. another issue I had was on the payment method, they said they can't take my card even though i had my complete details and sufficient funds (I tried using 2 different cards and it didn't work, I had this issue more then twice)."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this app, so far I've had no issues. The app is very easy to use everything has its place. I've placed one order with 3 items. The prices are great, shipping was faster than expected. I placed the order on 01-02 and received it on 01-11, the expected arrival date was 01-24. I am extremely happy with the quality of the product's and I will be ordering much more soon!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"For the most part app is user friendly. Couldn't obtain where to get sign in points today. Kept pushing button, and nothing helped. I don't understand why at times the notifications say free shipping and when I click over. It's a different story. Can never find it again . I don't like yhat issue. Other than that. The app is ok."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app has good interface and is easy to use. It's the only good thing about the app. The garments and sling bags I recieved are of extremely cheap quality for the price. Plus it doesn't show return option for most of the cheap quality products. Neither there's cod option. Moreover the delivery of the product takes a long time, like more than half of a month. Really disappointed with the app! I've just burnt a hole in my pocket for the cheap quality products"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app itself is very user friendly, but can be extremely slow. As for the company, you get what you pay for. Items are very cheap, pay close attention to reviews (especially regarding clothing sizes) So far, Shein does seem worth the time, since you can get great deals. And they have a great variety of items! Not just clothes 😉 it's easy to throw your money away, so be careful. Quality can be very, very poor; yet the feeling that youre saving money is so addictive you want to come back."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I don't ever shop for clothes but honestly Shein makes this so simple lol I'm addicted now and the quality of clothes is exceptional! I look great and people have broken their necks to check me out haha Of the 700 plus dollars I've spent in the last month or so I had one problem with an item and the issue wasn't big enough to even want a refund. Simple lace popped off from the loop in a shoe. Great clothes! Happy spending!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I would give this app great review. After having oreder several items within the month of July into August. I've received all purchased and everything fit and the quality it not bad. I would continue using this app although I do shopping at brand clothing stores as well. I'm very particular and can only not agree with the imagine reflect. I have my own shape and figure not to compared. I'm not looking for Points I'm confident with the way I look. Other than that the app is great.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Prices fluctuate in outfits just by colour and u gotta really hunt to get the best price in the multi versions of each item ... Kinda time consuming it's easy to over spend ... Personally as a shopaholic I love every minute of it and manage well in sales. Trial clothing offered could be better ... It would be of benefit to offer a wider range of clothes and select more users. Shein points is good I did save like ten bucks so far yet can be lost in cancelled or return orders
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love SHEIN! The app works really well. Their products are so diverse, well priced and most are pretty good quality. The clothes, once you find your general go-to size and get used to reading the reviews and description, they are easy to buy and find the right fit. Their customer service was super responsive and helpful (although I only needed it once). The shipping is pretty fast (about 2 weeks) and they often have free shipping days or coupons. No space to write. DOWNLOAD IT!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,fake offer! it is written open account new user then u will get -30% after I make new account and added my goods to basket. I did not get anything. it is written code not applied.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Most of the clothes are good quality and the shipping is fast. This is my first time doing a return however and it shows that they are going to refund me a discounted price instead of the original purchase price. I have heard returns are awful with them and it doesn't seem fair to not get the price I paid on an item back. Probably best to keep items and resale or donate instead of return. The shoes are nice. Pretty good quality for the price.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Hoping that the points would go to normal since it would be budget friendly especially to us students & online seller/s of your app! I really love your items it's good quality but it's irritating that you'd change the points! it would be fine without such events just get the points back:((
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I LOVE SHEIN!! Everything is cheap, all the coupons and points from reviews make it even cheaper!! Maybe 1 out of every 10 things I order is a miss, otherwise they almost always exceed expectations. I originally started ordering from Shein because of their HUUGE selection of plus size clothes that are actually cute and now have found that they have soo many cool products. Just about anything you can think of is on here. This app is AWESOME!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"THIS is the 7th time i have uninstalled this app due to disappointment.. i have spent soooo much time browsing through products to choose and all but whenever i want to checkout it gives me the same lame old ""your block number is incorrect"".. trust me i have tried 10 different addresses, still the same answer. I have emailed your customer service but still no reply!! I mean what the hell SHEIN.. I am really REALLY disappointed :(("
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Was going to order from here but found my checkout price vs the price in my cart before checkout was significantly higher. Not sure what the extra cost was but if prices of items aren't the same as when you check out then what's the point in having them there. Very misleading.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Soooo, the app was easy and not many ads, BUUUT when I got to the checkout there was no 10% discount added for first order customers and the ""free shipping"" wasn't ""free"" at all. There was an extra line for ""shipping guarantee"" for $1.99, that is NOT ""free"". I know it's only $1.99 but it's the principal. Changed my mind about ordering because if they lied twice before even completing the process of ordering then what does that say about the company and their standards. One Love Everyone!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Great designs, kind of hard to search for items specifically because the titles of items are pretty abiguous and are similar to one another. Only two stars because every single item is polyester, including items that claim to be cotton. Wish they had a premium option because I wouldn't mind if they added a few dollars for a cotton version of their men's clothing. Folding up sleeves is impossible because the polyester fabric doesnt fold up, it just falls back down again."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is really really good but it makes me sad lng for the new update huhu. Why did you put limit on points now? Before it was really good because you can check out using any amount of your points. And pay only small amount when it is delivered but now I don't know, instead of maka save or less, you're now paying high amount because of the limit of the points that can be use."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I do really enjoy this app and shopping on it and I've almost never had an issue with what I've ordered, however I have noticed that there's a cart cap and a purchase cap and they're different. 1) if I want to buy 200 different products I should be allowed to do that and 2) if the purchase cap is something specific why isn't the cart cap the same so I know that when I checkout I can actually purchase everything in my cart?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've used shein for a while. In the past, returning an item was never an issue since it was free, and I always opted to put the money in my wallet instead of getting a return. But now you get one item free return and the rest you they take from your return. How is it possible that the return is more than what you paid for the items."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Products are too expensive. I only bought Shein products before because I get to apply all of my points in addition to the vouchers that can be applied but now, it does not allow you to apply all of your shein points inorder to save big. I personally believed that what makes Shein so popular before is the fact that they allow you to apply all of your points but now, due to changes, I'm quite disappointed because you only get to apply 30% of your points. Now, I'm buying less and less from Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,registered with my phone number only yo have the application continue to ask for me to log in and never able to go anything after confirming the code sent to my phone. after several times thus happened I decided to log in with my Gmail Instead. I was then met with a message of suspicious activity. customer service was no help said was my fault. I've requested deletion of my accounts. and have uninstalled the app. good riddance
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love Shein! The photo reviews that users share, make it so much easier to purchase online, because not only do I see their height and weight (of they choose to share that) but also a photo of them in the item so I can determine by a similar body type to mine if I think it will be a good choice for me or not. Prices are great and quality is great (cheaper things have lesser quality than the higher priced items, but nothing I've bought is poor quality)."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Inexpensive clothes and accessories in all sizes (up to 4XL I think). The app is great and easy to use and I think the value for the clothes is pretty great too, but it's definitely not designer quality (it's very low cost, what do you expect?) I love that you can see the model measurements and most items are true to size. It has such a positive vibe. So many different styles. The product review system is great. Love it!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"So many bugs and kind of a scam. Everytime there is ""free"" shipping they won't let you place an order after like 1 minute as they refresh their page due to ""network issues"" when it's clearly fine. Fix this please."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Exceptional site. Love the variety! Up to date tracking on items which lets you breath easy. Cannot wait to receive my order :) Only suggestion is: wish i could at times, when viewing a picture have the option to buy all items in a photograph. Eg searching a pair or pants and come across pants, top and shoes model is wearing - would buy all! :) Love Shein - keep it up guys."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Its difficult to get help for missing parcels. The tracking number won't work. Links from shein won't work, but it says delivered with a signature. Au post can't help because the tracking number won't work. Shein is hard to contact and slow to respond."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love the App and SOOO many of the household item's, Their jewelry collection's & ESPECIALLY their Lingerie category. There's literally so many item's listed on here that if you look long enough for the right price, I almost always find it at a lower price. Earning rewards and points in the app by playing games, sharing link's, or simply voting in polls for new item's to be added to the site. Just by opening the app once a day to use the ""checkin"" feature, get Rewarded. Many different Perks!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible experience. I downloaded the app because their website isn't working out for me and it sucks to find out that their app is terrible too. Initially I wanted to check out as a guest but that is not an option. When trying to sign up for an account through the app, I never got my registration confirmation email so I can't even sign in! It just keeps looping me back to sign up and telling me that I've registered and then telling me that my log in information is incorrect."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"They gat good fashioned things and also their services are very excellent that the ordered products reach in time but some times shein app disappoints me by saying the server is not on while going thru the things i want and then after disappear,and also please may you check the products you pack for the customers coz some have stayed for long in ware house,some have damages,and then they indicate no return, you need to work on that . And also may you include some delivery in African country ."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Pretty great deals. You get what you see in the pics—no surprises—& everything's true to size. The measurements of each item are clearly listed in cm/in. I tend to get a lot of compliments on clothes I get from here. Most of the stuff I've ordered has held up surprisingly well over time, too (given the price) with a few exceptions. Easy, straightforward returns process. Many payment options including Afterpay. Fast shipping to USA. I did NOT receive anything for writing this review."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing sales, though its not like they're needed with how affordable everything is. They do have curve and plus size clothing which is where i go to shop and everything is so cute that its hard to make a choice 😅. But in the end, its all worth it. The app is easily navigated and its not hard to filter your searches. Five stars, recommended daily"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app is very good 😊but when you by something in December it will not come it will come in January 🥺🥺🥺I love this app❤️❤️❤️
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I haven't had issues with the app for years until now. When I look through the daily merch it starts to lag the further in I go. It gets to the point where I can't get past the jewelry section without the app crashing on me. Been doing this for a couple of weeks now atleast. I've cleared the cache in my phone, restarted it, deleted and re-download the app. All the same result. I'm being forced to use my desktop if I want to see what's on the site. The app has turned into a terrible experience."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible usability, full of errors and points where you can't continue. Layout is not properly dynamic to different phone display/font settings, and I was constantly bombarded with online casino like popups. Generally irritating, frustrating, and I wouldn't recommend the brand or app to anyone. I only installed it because my daughter shared a refer a friend link to get her 5 free prizes, which we couldn't complete the process for anyway."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really nice app. One thing that for some reason REALLY bothers me is that when you go into a category for example: women's dresses, it doesn't say the amount of items at the top of the page so please change that, I get bored really easy so scrolling for so long and quitting makes me feel like I'm missing out, with knowing the amount of items, I can understand that I won't be scrolling for forever and can get to the bottom of the page. If that makes sense"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,SHEIN has been very excellent for me. I've been getting all of my items that I have purchased on time and actually before the estimated shipping date which is awesome. All of my clothes come without any damages and the material is great. I was skeptical at first because you do have some scamming websites but I can absolutely confirm that this is not one. They have reasonable prices and wonderful items to buy especially their clothes. I've been ordering from them at least once a month. Luv it!🤗❤
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I bought a pair of overalls. Quality was cheap. Ill fitting and just a weird cut. Then I uninstalled the app because of all the pop ups on my actual phone. After un install ads pop up 30 times a day. I emailed and asked how to fix this..no response. I feel completely violated. They hijacked my phone with stupid ads for clothes I don't like... and I can't do anything about it.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Quick and love the prices.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I ordered a few things from this app and all in all, everything is priced really good. It takes a little longer to receive what you bought and it's difficult to contact them. Also everything is very cheaply made and doesn't always match the pictures. Some things are good but NOT everything. I bought a hoodie from them and the pocket was at the chest rather than the stomach where it's supposed to be. Probably will never order from them again."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Pathetic experience. I ordered some things from the app a month ago, and i only recieved half of the order. There are no tracking details after the package was shipped. I don't want to cancel my order as i need the things but it's been a month and i haven't received the items. Customer care is unresponsive - everytime i call there's no one on the other side to talk, and the shein bot doesn't help either. Expecting a reply from SheIn."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I won't suggest Shein. One of the item came defective, and they won't allow return due to hygiene reason.I should mention that its not even lingerie, just gym bodysuit. I dont understand why it should be my problem that you are selling defective items? Ridiculous. AliExpress is much better Another thing, they keep deleting negative reviews😤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The clothes are extremely affordable and surprisingly good quality. Im a little curvier & i love that they still have cute clothes to fit ladies of any size for a good price without looking cheap...you can still be cute, professional, sexy, spunky... All types of styles. The return policy is decent i think its free for the 1st return for an order and if you have to return something else from the same order its 7.99 or something. I wish shipping was faster, its usually 2 to 3 weeks but thats ok."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"As a person the XL end of straight sizing, Shein has always been a great place to find clothing that actually fits. Since the addition of the Dazy collection though, using the ""XL"", or size filters at all, seems useless and is really frustrating. It's annoying to find a bunch of clothing that looks really good only to find out that XL is much closer to one or two sizes below, and makes me and want to quit shopping immediately. Please fix the sizing or the filter! An XL is not a size 6!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Been shopping with this company for a few years so here's my summary of my experience. Its overpriced and cheaply made. Even some of their premium items are not made very well. The only upside is I find unique items here. Another issue I had, recently was trying to buy a particular item. Ended up purchasing other items to fulfill the free shipment criteria to find after purchase, the item I WANTED was out of stock everything else shipped. Should of been told at check out not after processing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall quite satisfied, however a recent purchase of a green tray delivered on the 12/12 arrived damaged, also the product description said stainless steel, it was 100% plastic. I did put a review on but to date haven't heard anything. It isn't worth returning, it was a present so a further order may not arrive in time. Perhaps you could send a replacement as a good will gesture Regards"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely a disaster. My merchandise that I ordered was left at another apartment there are 755 units. There is no number to call, no success in chatting with them. My other package was left outside of the garage good thing nobody stole it. When you purchase something it's an estimated price which makes no sense at all. They definitely need a customer service number. I do not know if I will ever order from them again. Something is just not right."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Always good experience every time I shop with SHEIN.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Im addicted, I've ordered from here on several occasions, they have great clothes, the clothes are true to size so you don't have to order up a size like most places. Fast delivery, and the items get to you before the estimated date. Plus they have it so you can split the payments in to 4 installments if you don't quite have the full amount at the time of payment. I LOVE SHEIN!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Seriously the best shopping app out of all the romwe, shein, zaful etc apps. Free shipping on Sundays and sometimes of Thursdays. and you can always find a 20% off coupon on retailmenot! Trust me, I've had this app for a long time and it's amazing. Shipping usually takes 1 week or less. They have such a large selection with more being added everyday. Their home items and accessories are great too. Their service is great. I once had something run a little late and they gave me 300 points!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I like SHEin. It's easy to use and I love how you can collect points that you can use as real money when ordering. I also enjoy that there's usually many reviews from other buyers for every item. I just wish that the recommendations would actually fit my likings more because there's nothing of interest for me there and I have to search for a while until I find things I actually want.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Before it was ok. But now i will say rubbish. You know why, i ordered recently last sept. 27 2023. Not its November and until now i have not received the item i ordered. And whats worst is they kept deducting my direct debit account eventhough i have not receive the item yet. What a shame. Now i have to delete my card in klarna just to make sure they wont get my money for free. For SHEIN company i hope you read this."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm shocked at how awesome this app is. The filters are very advanced, and allow you to search by fabric! No more ordering from China and getting stuck with a spandex t-shirt!The clothes are pretty darn good quality for the cost too. Plus, you can return anything you don't want for free. I'm never buying clothes anywhere else again. Seriously."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is useful, easy to navigate, and has a lot of fun ways to earn free points toward purchases. The items that I've recieved are decent quality, especially considering the very low prices. My main complaint is the amount of time items take to ship to their destinations, but even that isn't such a huge problem to deal with. Overall, I've had a very good experience using Shein, and I plan on continuing to use it for the foreseeable future!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Very good budget friendly collections of everything but only drawback is delivery time. 🚚 9-14 days of delivery time is ridiculous! Where al most every website try to ensure the delivery 3/4 days they take 9-14. I even forgot what I ordered. Wherever if don't mind about the waiting time looking for good products within your budget this is the app. Highly recommend 👍🏆
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely horrible experience ,I ordered for 6 things from which 3 of them did not fit . When I tried returning it ,I chose the pick up from my home option and they kept cancelling the pick up and said sorry now follow up with shien. I am continuously trying to call the customer service and no one ever picks up the phone to help . So I am stuck with the products and my money is going to waste. Absolutely horrible service . Totally disgusted. Do not get influenced by the YouTubers ."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The items are fine quality, not great but not bad, definitely worth the price. Shipping is fairly quick but customer service doesn't seem to be of much help when there's something wrong after the order ships, for instance needed to change my shipping address as my first set of items went to a place I had no access to. Had to get the police involved to retrieve the package after customer service ""changed"" the delivery address. Overall, good experience, needs better customer service."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The clothes are super cute - definitely fast fasi9n and affordable. However, I keep getting the wrong orders OR I make an order just to have the money come out of my account and then get told they are out of several products that I've purchased. My last several orders have been entirely messed up. I attempt to contact customer support to get a resolution, and it's a giant loophole that ends in frustration. I wish the customer service was better because I actually love SHEIN."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,LOVE SHEIN! My go-to for all my latest fashion and accessory. Sizes from XS-5X... AMAZING! The prices are crazy good... Anyone can afford SHEIN. The quality of most items are mind blowing (in the best way!) Be sure to read reviews and description before purchase. I admit... I've become too addicted and have needed to delete the app more than once 🤣
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used to be able to use the app but now everytime i go into the app, i just get an error message that the shein server has something wrong and cannot load. Now i cant see anything in the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app!! It's sad some people have issues, I have always received good quality items usually before estimated delivery time. It's affordable and website (app) is designed really well. People often compliment me on pieces from here too. If there is a room for improvement I'd like to see better filter options, such as being able to view skirts and pants together. Other than that well deserved 5 stars."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Not bad for the most part, they have some okay quality clothing, some that are horrible that you can't tell from the model photos, reviews are sometimes trustworthy, other times they are just making them for points even if the clothing doesn't look good, the app itself is pretty good, functional, I get too many notifications and wish I could choose what they send to me without switching them off completely in my settings."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Its cheap and affordable. When it comes to the quality you get what you paid for. The shirts can be thin and see through but its still cute and wearable. If you have a larger chest get large or x large. When it comes to jeans and bottoms they do fit weird and sizing is off but again with a little tweaking , it's wearable. Their shoes are amazing. Good quality and last awhile plus its cheap."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've had this app for a couple of years now and have been ordering clothes every couple of months. There were definitely some hits and more misses in the beginning, but now the quality (at least the things I choose) are quite good and for the price an absolute bargain. Shipping also improved, mostly takes between 5-7 days to ship from china to Europe. Defiently would recommend."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is very easy to use and navigate. You can track items, review, returns, and have a wishlist and it will even do recommendations. The clothes have been of good quality and fit for the most part. (Be sure to pay attention to the fits under size picked). 90% of what I order is a Med/6, but some things have been xs, s, or lg based on BUST size. So far everything I got I have liked. A couple things need tweaking because not everyone is built like a model."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Easy to use app, easy to add coupons, fast delivery. Very happy with the service. If I was to add one thing to Shein, it would be a ""Tall"" section, its hard to find clothes at times long enough in arms or legs for girls who are 5ft 10 and taller... like me and my daughter. I've only had 1 order and am very happy so far. Have another order gone through so will see how this one goes. No issues with app, has never crashed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Please, add dark mode. It'll help with eye strain, prevent potential headaches from browsing and would ultimate be better. Not everyone is okay with opening their phone to a blinding light, especially in a dark room. It would also be visually pleasing for some that prefer dark mode. Or, add a dark mode for your website at least. It's a great app, although it would be nice if some of the coupons didn't expire so fast."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is just so fun! It's like the best online window shopping I've ever done. Even better than Amazon. I've purchased a few items and the outcome has been about 60/40. Clothes coming from China just never has consistentancy in terms of size, structure, color, etc. But it's so cheap (and I want to bury my head in the sand for now on the reasons why) and so I don't mind."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Great app I enjoy it a lot but there are some tweaks that would make it much easier for me Matching items should be linked for ease of search Return items are a real headache why do we have to manually enter the sku for each item? It should be filled in automatically when I mark an item for return The search should include seasons The search for the plus size category needs to be much more organised. When I choose curve plus and try to check the new items it takes me back to regular size
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"While the ads are great, it can be quite difficult to get back to some of the items previously viewed. Equally, adding an item to your wishlist only works for one colour not the whole range of colours for that item. In the end you can find yourself with several different listings of that item. The upshot? You know you really want that item."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Suitable price and nice design fashion. Quick international delivery (less than 7days) Returning product, also quick response and reliable service. Regard to the app also good function, all my favorite dresses are same as on the website. So I see the dress ad, click to see it on mobile app, click favorite the dress, and open to see it later on desktop whenever I am free."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Shein has very recently (during Black Friday 2023) decided to nerf point discounts from 70 to 30 percent with no prior notification, completely ripping off anyone who has been saving points for a large purchase. Predatory business practices. Before this, the SheIn app was excellent and functioned very well."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I ordered 5 pieces. All came, but the shipping was a little slow. I ordered two of the same swimsuit but in different colors. One was exactly as I expected, but the bottoms to the other were extremely cheeky. I also ordered a shirt and the material was not what was described and it was detailed slightly different than expected. However, everything else was great. My order came in 12 days."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Nice app and good quality, too. However, it's just sad that when something doesn't fit, you can only return it for free and not exchange it. I ordered a dress that was too big, returned it, but they wanted to charge me a $7 shipping fee to order a size down. I forgot the plan. Guess I'll find a dress at Walmart instead since it'll be around the same price. I won't have to wait for shipping and I'll be able to return it without any hassle."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I don't understand why the description isn't accurate. I want to view Duvet Fillers . But when I type that into search via the sites app . All I get is duvet covers without fillers .. which is not what I'm looking for so it's a waste of time . I may as well go to a retail shop in the high street .
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is nice and all, but it's useless on pc, because you can't change the language, so I can't order anything through there, because I don't understand what it says..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I gave it a 5 because it's very cheap and it is very worth it ❤️I am sooo happy with this wonderful app
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Keeps shutting down my game coz of unusual behaviour. Only just joined. So nah!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Out of the things i ordered, let's say I have only 10% disappointment from 100%. Which related mainly to material quality and fitting, but the 90% is perfect considering its cheap prices. One of the online shopping app i really love to browse and waste my time with. You never get bored and unfortunately it empty your wallet 😂"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Most items are oversized. Customer reviews are the only thing that help in deciding whether to buy or not. That is the best feature (reviews). Customers sometimes give exaggerated reviews hoping for ""likes."" I ended up purchasing several items that are not very good. Other items are over the top amazing. So, Shein is hit & miss. I didn't ""hate"" any items. It's a decent app. Items arrive 15 days from placement of order (Dec.2021). Returns have a $7.99 return postage fee."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's an addiction. I'm from SA, CPT and the anticipation caused by the waiting period (+/- a month) is the only thing I 'dislike' but overall, I've been impressed with all the items purchased on Shein. From hair accessories to footwear. I'd recommend it to all. The other thing that is not mentioned is when purchasing, put a little cash aside for TAX/ Customes fee that needs to be paid before arrival of goodies. It's not bad though, e.g, I spent just over R1000 and paid a fee of 100 and odd rand."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app!! It's so amazing and has literally anything you could want, whether it be clothes, jewellery, organising things, accessories, bags, underwear. Literslly everything and it's fabulous. The pricing is brilliant too and you can get dupes of other brands for way better deals. The only thing making me give it 4 stars is the expensive shipping cost and sometimes the products aren't the best quality. Apart from that, it's brilliant"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein has transformed my fashion life and self esteem. I have literally got a new wardbrobe that fits my long body and are fashionable and very cheap. Have spent thousands on there, in the 2 plus years I have been shopping on Shein and still CANNOT STOP ""browsing""/ shopping on the website. Great value for money. Special Thank you to the owner of Shein.. and to all the staff there. And thanks to all who leave the very helpful reviews. Fantastic service all round. No complaints at all."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Definitely a zero star because we bought a dress for the Valentine's dance it was the wrong color 😔 and it was see through.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Love this app! Can get some really decent bits for good prices. Some items can come up small but some can come up big so it can be risky choosing a style but usually okay! Love most of the items I've bought! You can earn daily points which is used to take money off when you make a purchase. Delivery can be a little slow but still good service- when your stuff arrives if you rate it you earn more points which is good! Deffo recommend the app!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Suspicious game. The puppy keep game. You blocked me from playthis game and I assume it's because I figured out it's rigged. And you know now I will screen shot or record it everyday to prove the truth.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"They have all kinds of neat stuff at great prices and they give you the opportunity to earn coupons-good ones- like free shipping or decent % off entire orders. They have contests and flash sales and even a free trial program. Women, men, kids, pets- something for everyone in your household and neat gift ideas. Easy returns and readily accept feedback or suggestions.They actually care. I did have an order that was missing a couple items, but not gonna fuss about $1 items. Pretty cool all around."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Addicted, you have to wait a while for the packages obviously, but I havent had any issues with the quality of anything I've bought, clothing, home decor or otherwise. Just pay close attention to the reviews on each item and the sizing charts!! Sometimes reviews say to size up or down, the information on the buyer's sizing and what size they bought/photos they upload of the products help a lot!! (Not to mention you can earn coins to put towards buying things too!!)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I LOVE this app, I've already purchased so many outfits for me and my daughter. They're reasonably priced and come as expected. It's a breeze to shop on the app and they'll have different promotions going on where you can get even better deals and free shipping sometimes. Even paying for the shipping costs isn't bad, though, and you can usually use a coupon on top of that. And the items always ship and arrive faster than the estimate time."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Haven't had an issue yet. It's easy to navigate. I had to make a return and I managed it fast and easy. Only thing is it's hard to find things from website to app but it's not a huge deal. I love all the coupon codes you can get just wish you could double up on them. Especially if your a top tier member. Also it's really hard to get picked to be a reviewer for the free product trials. But I'll keep trying until I hit. Just wish you could remove the failed attempts from your profile.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shipping with in two weeks or earlier, so far not disappointed in the site itself , when shipping tin you all need to use fragile and not just bag it, time reaches customer all bent up."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Custmer services are horrendous i want to speak to an agent & the bot thing wont let me keeps returning yo the same question, its got to be easier way to speak to a person .......doing my head in Also iv noticed the clothes have gone really expensive & the sizing of them is terrible just latley iv had to go up at least 2 sizes to get the items to fit, its not on, plus trying to find the shein fit section as it was called is ridiculous since the name change just keeps giving the plus sizes"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,MY FAVORITE SHOPPING APP!! I've never had any problems with the app itself... or payment. I've gotten all of my items within a week or less. Very pleased with the fast shipping. Also your items are staralized before shipped. I used to be a wish customer until I found SHEIN. I've not left since.. Great deals. Especially around Christmas and on black Friday. I've spend a lot of money and I've not been disappointed. shein has a lot of many items. SO CHECK THEMM OUT!!!!!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I do like shopping here because the clothes are very affordable. The problem is returning items....they don't provide this service and you have to return it on your own and you will be shouldering the cost. Which is very inconvenient and you will end up paying more for shipping fee than the dress itself. Too much hassle. They should have partners shipping company that offers easy and affordable way to return item.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Before I loved the app but now its freakin baddddd.... There's a lot of changes, previously we can exhaust our point but right now we can only used 30% our points plus some of our point easily expired. You cannot also used some of the coupons since you can only use it to specific brands."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Too too much polyester. I would buy a lot of tops but very few with cotton, or even cotton blends. For some people polyester and plastic threads irritate skin or material gets snagged. But great photography on items, good selections and prices, easy navigation on app. Need more fabric options and the kind of fabric used on item should be posted and easy to find. Should be more options oñ fabric, and notes, like dry clean, mach washable. Shrinkage? Measurements on pants helps a lot."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I recieve a link that took me to the shien app to get a coupon for R9000 I made a payment off R38 and than it request me to pay a delivery cost off R40 and didn't want to accept the card I was using the R38 was not refunded. I trusted to make the payment as I bought from shien and have not had a problem so when the link took me to the app I though it's a safe platform but now I have no Coupon and the money was taken from my account
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great site with many styles of fashion & accessories. Sizes will vary but be sure to look at measurements & fabrics. Makeup is great from here too, I think it's better than some U.S. brands. No issues, no allergic reactions. I read peoples complaints about shipping in their reviews & I think those are the people that don't pay the extra .99 cents to ensure shipping. So don't believe it. I've paid the extra .99 cents and have NEVER had any shipping issues."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I probably spent about 30 minutes, searching and putting about 6 to 8 items in my cart, when I signed in ,all of those items were gone. But what I put in the search bars were still there (that makes no sense). I guess I won't be purchasing those items 🤷🏾‍♀️ ,its an inconvenience to have to search and scroll to find what I was ready to pay for."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really like the versatility and the huge selection of items whether it's for petite or plus size, men or women, of all ages. The app is also very easy to use, for everything is very organized and categorized so you could easily find what you wanted by filtering the results. As per the quality of clothes, it might not be as good and durable as designer's clothing, but for a fast fashion, it is pretty decent. The clothes would last for a year or two with proper care and washing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Omaygi! HAHAHA your products are so expensive and most of us rely to the coupons. Before you change it, before we could get a free shipping our purchase must exceed 250 Pesos, now you put a limit in points coupons! Please put it back even with the purchase must exceed a total of 250!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It has amazing items for great price and shipping is always on time but the app itself is ridiculous. I try to save up points as much as possible BUT they expire really fast. They also have free shipping for orders over 9.99 sometimes but when I use my points it doesn't let me have free shipping. Only 1 coupon can be used per order (including free shipping coupon) and I'm young and broke lol these updates are disappointing.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great quality and delivery, decent prices but soo many items and the search function isn't great. I feel like there are more and more items as shein gains popularity, but that the prices are rising and I can't seem to find anything anymore. When I do find something though, its generally great quality and looks good. Sizing can be a pain, but that's how it is for most online shopping."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall, shopping is alright. Searching for items is relatively easy. What I am getting increasingly annoyed at is the Review system. You can write reviews to earn points. I have had to write the same review 6 times because it keeps messing up on me. Shein, please fix this!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I can't use all of my points in my order because it changed from 30% only. Please bring it back to 70% for us, change it. It is convenient but now it is not for us who really using points for cheaper price."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Useless customer service. I ordered two times. Both times there were huge delays. Customer service say they are going to follow-up, but they don't do. Worst customer service ever. Don't trust the delivery times they provide you."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a great app it delivers fast and the products are very cheap but the only problem is that it doesn't come with great packaging I ordered slingshot shots and it wasn't closed very well so it teared and went all over the other stuff so I would give them a 5 star if they did better at the packaging thank you
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Too good to be true? It's true! I was skeptical at first but I started buying some outfits to try them out and now I can't stop! I love their point systems and their constant coupons. The clothes and items are already affordable but they make it even more affordable buy offering the points system and coupons. I also love how when something goes out of stock, it's back in stock within couple of days, unlike other websites that never restock! I'm so glad I can be in style but also stay on budget."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I ordered lots of items to be shipped to Bulgaria.Most of the clothes are of low quality. I wanted to return them but it's impossible as they don't give you an eligible address nor an email or telephone number. No courier company accepts the return items without proper address and a telephone number. They have decieved me.There is no Customer service just a robot with some ready-made questions that doesn't answer any issues. I advise people never trust this site. It's a scam.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Quality has gone down, products price have gone up. Also the points suck now, you get pennies off. Lastly, i don't know what this game mode thing is where you get 100s of dollars worth of stuff for free but it looks like a scam."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"For me shein has been the best app I've always received orders when they say they'll deliver. And the clothes quality is as it says and shows from the app and reviews. I'm satisfied but i moved to another country and they wiped my account. I wasn't happy, i had points but I'll start a fresh. Hopefully you can get to all countries. Went to Kenya you still don't deliver there."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really like the prices, super affordable. Shipping can falter occasionally otherwise the order comes on time."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They are so unprofessional. Never ever helped me to get my meal plan. No matter what if it's expire, I can't still open it. Like it's supposed to be there in my account, No matter if I open it after a year or 10 times a year. Cause I purchased that plan. and it's still not there."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have turned off every possible notification setting available and yet I still receive 10+ emails or push notifications a day. I less likely to even open the app much less buy anything when I'm pestered to death every single day. I'm 1 email away from deleting the app
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Honestly these people deliver the product to you after they lie about the advertising. I measured the product I ordered and it was not even the size as advertised on the pic. This has happened multiple times now. EXTREMELY disappointed, will not recommend anyone else deal with this FRUSTRATION."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"dear shein,im using this app for years now.i placed so many orders with guys.and its always makes me happy & never disappointed me.but recently all changed.coupons are not working.points not making any effects to final price.and i feel like its become so expensive and prices are so high.its makes me to stop ordering from you.because i dont feel i getting good deal.now your are same like all other apps.nothing good.i hope you will change and give us real discount and makes coupons works. thanks."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It would REALLY help if, when you put items from your wish list to your boards, they'd disappear from the wish list. It'd make it easier to organize the boards. Edit: mf I'd have a better experience if you'd listen to my advice"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is great but it's not letting me edit my personal body into, the icon just spins. This would really make the app amazing and I hope it's working soon!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,They are having this sale or event where you choose 5 free items and in order to get those eitems you have to invite friends to shein.. well did all that and the page closed. False advertising so that puts me at a 1 star. I like the app but this experience has ruined it for me.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My rating went from 5 stars to 1 because of an incident that happened today. My items were supposed to be delivered today, so the courier contacted me around 10 a.m. asking for my location. I sent him my location the same minute and asked him when will he come. The courier replied to my message after 8 hours and said he returned the package because of the wrong location. I checked just to be sure of myself. Turns out he was lying just to deliver 2 days later. YOU MUST GET BETTER COURIERS."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I have received some stuff that don't look like in the pictures but some stuff do come as described on picture. As well as size. It can be too small sometimes or too big. Other items come just right size
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I would like to delete even this 1 star, I cannot make payment from my debit account because it is a bank that is excluded, although it it a well known bank in South Africa, there is NO way to contact customer care, must be cause there is NO customer care, I'm very disappointed they advertise beautiful clothes but you cannot pay for it. There should be an option to make an eft payment even if you have to wait 2 working days for it to clear before your order can go through. not impressed"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love this app but I went into the app (that my children use aswell) I went into the beauty section and I saw sexual wellness and I'm very disappointed that it was so easy to access it so easly and not appropriate for the young generation that uses this app the most and I don't want to tell them to delete it but I'm going to have to I want you shein to fix this right now , thank you"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My girlfriend ordered clothing off Shein and she got a notification that it was delivered but it never got here, and she reported what happened and they said that they couldn't do anything about it which is unfair because the order was 40+ and basically they kind of stole money off her and not she's scared to order and doesn't trust it anymore. I advise you to delete this app before it happens to you."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The SHEIN has an overall great idea, but I hate how I can't change my reviews only delete them. I get some packages damaged and the items don't always work. Would really like this feture to be changed or added."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Poor delivery times and can take payment without you authorising it ....just boom ordered and money gone while just browsing option's, no comunication unless you have a simple question for a robot..... items sold are cheap quality with poor sizing.....save your money and buy quality elsewhere And I've tried on many occasions entering customer service or agent etc....its impossible to get through to human with any kind of customer service ,my experience with shein is never a good one"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"""Puppy Keep"" game is rigged. Stopped awarding feed and daily login reward. Items are marked down at higher price to seem like a deal. With price marked down, it's just regular buying price. Shein is starting to copy ""Temu"". Total Rig and totally annoying!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I would give this place a negative star if I could! Watching my tracking (as I paid for express shipping) on December 4th, I've been updated by shien that my package would arrive no later than Dec 19 and has left and re entered 11 different facility's in hong kong and china for whatever idiototic reason that is and still shows that its in china at some other facility as of today ( Dec 20 ) my package hasn't even left their country the day after it was due at my house lmao. PATHETIC!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Love the products, but the app it's self needs work, not getting daily notification to check in, puppy pal gives error messages and doesn't let you play, can't search for puppy pal at different times either."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Well for most is good app and things arrive on time and are in working order. Trying to get a hold of someone to get reimbursed for the items that arrived broken or not at all is. A. CHALLENGE !!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It great shipping is quick and always on time most people will say that it over charges but there's tax if it's 6 dollars there will 3 dollars shipping fee or tax they really be judging shein but for me it my go to app for cloths 11 items for 100 dollars is vary affordable
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The first problem is that they don't have customers care service and the second is they didn't ask the courier company why they didn't deliver parcel and return it to company back and also the courier company is very rude and very selfish people have .... 👎👎👎👎 Uninstalling app
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"All support to SHEIN the best app ever. 🙌 Their customer service is Top and N1 . I ordered from Shein, and I needed my order before the 10th Dec, but it is scheduled for the 12th. emailed them and contacted customersupport , nd they promised to expedite my order . And this is exactly what happened they responded to y email in an hour and sent me the order 4 days before the decided time frame . They cooperated and sent me faster before I traveledThanks a lot Shein 🙏 💓 💗 Best service ever."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I love shein and will rate it 5 stars if there was an option to have multiple carts I think that makes it easier especially for someone that orders frequently. Please think about adding this feature
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Really dissatisfied about their services. Delivery time is not in 8-10 workind days. When you would like to check its process, there is not any validated information. It looks like your orders stays 5 days in somewhere, another 5 days in another way, as a result, you are waiting for more days. Still, I am waiting, I do not know where is my orders!!! They told me they will give me 500 points (5 dollars) for the delay. I want my orders, not 5 dollars. Never use it again!!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"""Shein is my go-to fashion destination! The trendy styles, affordable prices, and diverse collections keep me coming back for more. The user-friendly app and quick delivery make shopping a breeze. Love my Shein wardrobe! 🛍️ #SheinFashion"" -jov"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I really should've read the reviews more closely. I place an order, and it gives a date when it will be delivered by, then that order is delayed, so when you check when it will be delivered, it is at least another 10 days wait. I understand that delays happen, but all 7 of my orders are now delayed!!? I then get 50 credits for each order delayed. I have over 600 credits that not only can I NOT use, but i won't use. Once all my orders come in, if they do, I won't be ordering again"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Okay, this a an update from my previous rating. The clothes are great. The number id's have been fixed , and everything seems to work. Pretty simple app, love the way things are layout on the app 9/10"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Worst customer service ever, I texted them asking for help cuz one of the items I ordered the box was empty, I had to send email after 30 min searching on how to connect the support, just make it harder for people why not? I waited 2 days and they said nothing is missing in your order, really?? Simply sell people empty boxes then tell them you got the package what is missing, What a joke. Deleted."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's happening to me that the application is not working well, it tells me that there is an error in the connection path, the pages are not loading and I uninstalled it and reinstalled it and now it won't let me log in."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is good but as of 10/25/2023 the daily login point is broken, everytime I try to check in it just turn white and nothing happens tried to open it for 30 mintues but nothing hapoens. I dont know where to report bugs because on the app its all about their products/service that you can report. *I WILL REMOVE THIS UNTIL THE ISSUE IS FIXED* (ISSUE IS FIXED NOW). Heres my actual review, the app is good since i downloaded it I didnt encounter any bugs except for the issue previously mentioned."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is good but I have these suggestions. We can refine a search to features we DO want, but I'd like to be able to refine a search to RULE OUT certain things that I will never want to buy eg. Body con dresses. I have to scroll past so many of them and it wastes my time. Also a feature that tells us when we've already bought an item. Sometimes I'm waiting for deliveries to arrive and get confused with what I've already bought. I don't want to accidentally buy it again."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tat .. and unreliable search. No way to find a precise type of product, for example, searching for ""USB NIC"" brings up thousands of products, ranging from a memory stick to a car stereo. It's the same strategy shops use, requiring customers to walk and eyeball more products, and you spend more... but these apps are on another level, and unfortunately for them, it's backfired, as all I've done is uninstall it!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Just did a big order. The pet outfits are way to small but they won't let me return them. The blanket and wallet pouch is so cheaply made that I would be embarrassed to give as a gift , so very disappointed. Temu was much better. I will NEVER buy from shein again EVER"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really love Shein and your products. It's cheap but good quality. However, the points policy changed, I think, because my points can now only lessen the supposed amount of my order, which is quite disappointing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Invite rewards are a complete scam, they never let you reach the goal they just start giving you 0.01 per invite. Almost every shirt on this app is polyester or crudely made I would suggest not risking it at all as I spent a lot of money just to hate 3/4 of my order. They make returning things nearly impossible and even if you do they will deny the return and keep it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"In general I was happy with the service but recently they choose Imile as delivery in Mexico apparently and it hasn't been such a good idea. Not just me but others had problems, I never received my order but it was indicated as delivered."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love shein but why they changed some of it specially the coupons, some coupon don't work and only works for specific items.. second when u adding items in my cart it's already deducted price and the coupon already applied but i can change it if there is better coupon, and when i review my total it seems i dont get much discount only my points help tiny bit its just not like the same it used to be 🥺"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ordered stuff for my birthday on the 9th, still waiting for it on the 12th. Expedited shipping for at least 11th but to no avail, not sure when it'll come in because there is no estimated time. just ontrac and that barely helps."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very bad experience for return, ordered for return but the pickup never come and try to contact delivery service also useless. Don't buy as the returns took forever and i still waiting now."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,They try to overwhelm you with so many different promotions and deals all at once. They let me draw like 6 times where I just so happen to get 299 out of the 300 diamonds I needed to get 300. All I have to do is refer one friend right? Wrong. It's a scam and I mean in their defense they don't steal from you but that just use less the honest means to get you to share.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Had troubles with order due to seller sending wrong item, had to keep asking and finally got my refund,. Have another encounter with defects on item, want to return, nightmare returning, insufficient information on how to. Good luck if you guys encounter issues with your item"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Well my shopping experience is absolutely a 5 star rating, love there products, you have to spend time with your shopping read the review. The first few times the delivery was excellent also 5 star rating tops delivery from Buffalo logistics 👍🏻. But now my two previous parcel they use ARAMEX they are poor service, unprofessional, rude, and if you call there's no answer, there trucking service update every 10 days. Big NO for ARAMEX. GO BACK TO BUFFALO LOGISTICS PLEASE PLEASE 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,So far from what what I’ve bought they have good products and good prices but if you have issues it would take an act of god to resolve your problem..I see answers from the company telling you that you can Access customer service but you really can’t ask a question..the questions are all pre-written for you...I had ordered a set ordered a set of tweezers and Only received one ..Have not been able to get it resolved
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Love ordering stuff from shein normally always receive everything but recently one of my items never came and they're saying it was delivered with the rest of my stuff. Wasn't something expensive or whatever but it's the fact that they're saying it did get delivered. Keep your customers happy is all I'm saying.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love shein. Not gonna lie its hit or miss. However more hit than miss and when it hits it hits! The shoes are trash. Don't ever buy. They also have coupons. Sales. Cheap prices for the whole family and the house. Curvy aka plus size. I gotta say tho, this new collab with forever 21 ain't it. We don't want forever 21. We love shien. Don't switch up too much. Or you will deff lose customers and business. So far you haven't lost a star bc of it. Let's hope you never do."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Love the prices and the products that are available but I made my very first order on November 25th and I not received it. This is my first and last order with Shein. Once the issue is resolved, I plan to delete my account and the app. :("
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very easy to use. Safe payment options. Always deliver. And their customer care are fantastic. Recommend this app to anyone wanting to buy shein products.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I updated the latest version however when I click the check in for coins button it doesn't proceed to checking in. It's been two days and I don't know what to do. I been using the app for years i regret having it updated 😞
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very satisfied. Received my packages on time and great quality. Grandkids loved their outfits. One happy grandmother, thank you to all the Shein team. Happy holidays to you all."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The delivery is so disappointing.. For a week I keep receiving a remarks of undelivered! Too many times I do the live chat in shein csr and email the courrier they keep telling don't worry blah blah.. But until now, same issue.. The delivery associate keep asking about the location but will not deliver.. If you will not change your tandem with courrier you will always have a not good feedback about your services.. Your delivery associates are lazy and don't know the meaning of good services.."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I order some stuff starting October and 24 October I was supposed to receive it still didn't get it. Tracking shows delay in delivery.. This is my last time ordering at shein.i will wait for 1 more week and I want a refund if I don't have it
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It used to be a good app but through the updates it's not anymore. Before I can put all my points with the limit of 70% of my purchases with no min free shipping but not I can only 30% and not even free shipping.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I don't have problems with the reviews anymore, but I have a problem with the shipping. It says that I have free shipping on sundays, but when I'm going to finish my order, it says I got to pay $8.99 for shipping. Like, make up your mind, it it free or not?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The cloches rip quickly I just hate it and the material of the jerseys make me sweat and they over price their stuff also one of my items from shein never came I just don't like the fact that a necklace in my country is over 20R and the only thing that is nice there are the shark slippers they are so comfy but i still have to give it a 1 star rating
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely frustrating.. products are usually decent quality. Just don't play their games or invite people on there for them. The games are Absolutely impossible to win. You never get any free gifts in the games, they cheat you out of points and you never get credits for signing on new users. I should have won 5 gifts but they wouldn't give me my credit for 3 new signs ons. Just one of many ways they cheat you after you've done their job and recruited new users. Customer service is a joke too"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I really don't even wanna give this app a one star it deserves 0. My packages always come beat up sometimes broken the quality of the cloths are horrendous they literally fall apart. And the shipping takes a LONG time it tool 2 weeks just for a sweater. This is a very poor app 😭
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,These people hard to reach I purchased some items and when I went to check back on the items they said it was canceled now I do not know why the items were canceled and where is my money for them and I cannot reach the company is there anything that I can do please help. Thank You
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I ordered clothes for vacation, they came 20 days late so I ended up on vacation with my old clothes the order was held in China forever, not the fault of DHL but shien. Super irritated because the order was over 300 dollars and I am tempted to return it all as soon as I get it. The shipping info was not correct, still says I'll get the order early December which is weeks ago at this point. Now I know never to trust shien even with a month long pre order date."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love shein it has really cheap items and all but one thing I don't like is that if you ask for a refund they keep your money and don't give the refund and it said it would give back my refund in 7 days but it has been 15 days. Recommend the app tho really good
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This app is so amazing but then there's a downside because I canceled my order and I was supposed to get my money of 100$ backt hey didn't give me my money and they did fraud on my brothers card it was brand new and the purchases were on shien if you have problems like mine please post about this so that something could be done I worked hard for that money.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The products are very good n looks expensive but there is one problem with the promos I was shopping for a promo that gives any 3 for $30 but when I checked out the amount was not deducted to $30 and there was not any promo code available at the site. Instead the clothes are of very nice quality and price are cheap as compared to others. Thanks SHEIN

It even tell you if the the material is a non stretch or not, I can go on an on but in a Nutshell SheIn is the best clothing app.🙌"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I am unhappy with the quality of clothes. I ordered first time on Shein some winter jackets but the quality is just what I would find at any gift centre meaning low quality. I had heard so many good things about Shein but my experience hasn't been pleasant.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is AMAZING. it tells me how much my item would cost in my country's currency, there are a lot of references of how the clothing items look on other people who have ordered the same items, there is a MASSIVE variety of clothing and cosmetics to choose from and Shein gives you the best prices for all of them. Not only that but the shipping time is also very quick (I ordered from South Africa and received it in a months time). I definitely love this app for online shopping!!"

I now had a hard time with our local carrier (j&t express), because of the 3attempts which is hard for me because I wasn't around... I hate j&t express for not having a concern when I raised my problem... I hate SHEIN, because it took them 8days to deliver the parcel... 1st try for SHEIN and it was a disaster already"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Did get a lot of notifications, change settings..still got quite a bit. Maybe because of special sales. As a food and business critic, Buy from them yes .. recommend yes .. advertising can be overwhelming during sales events . So purchase away at Shein' shopping now!! ☺️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's more expensive compared to a ton of online shopping apps. Use AliExpress. Instead, it looks like sellers on shein are charging more for the same stuff on AliExpress."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Super legit! The items are what they appear to be , the shipping is timely (& most of the time free!). SHEIN's games and rewards points system is the icing on the cake for me! 10/10 WOULD RECOMMEND!"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Nice items. I finally decided to do the daily check in but it seems useless when I can't even get past $6.30 at least. Points just expire every few days.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Untrustworthy. At best, they are bad at math. At worst, we're stupid for shopping here. Coupon codes NEVER match a calculators answer on what 15% is. I just had to remove 8 things at payment because they suddenly couldn't ship that to America when it said they could? It was $25 dollars worth of goods. It minused 7 bucks from my total. Shein should be illegal in America. We hold our companies to such higher standards. This trashy establishment is also evil. Stop buying from here."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Recently made my first purchase...I was a bit scared because it was my first online purchase, but SHEIN made the whole process smooth and assuring for me. The delivery was fast and communication was up to par. No complaints and no more fears...cheers to more orders."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great service and experience. Prices were very affordable and discounts amazing and free shipping. I am ordering from them again.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Shein has gotten super slick. You get quoted one price but when you go to check out they raise the price and then add your coupon and act like they've given you a discount. They used to be great but what they're doing is actually illegal in the States. You can't raise the price at checkout like seriously? I'm very disappointed with this company.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best option for internet shopping, you can find amazing deals and all types of beautiful outfits. The only thing that could be better is the shipping time, for the anxious is hard to eight many days 😂"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have bought many items over the last year The quality is excellent. i found that the import taxes are very high this year and dont think it will be affordable to buy as prices are almost doubled with taxes
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like shein products but what i like the most is the Hellokitty and friend stuff that is on shein miniso, i can't see the products from miniso at all for like months now, i don't understand what's happening, is it an error from the app or is shein france won't have miniso products in it no more, please explain this to me and fix this as soon as possible please."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The maximum discount using your shein points is lowered from 70% off to 30% off. Now It seems the items are expensive because you can only lower the original price by 30%.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The worst place to shop. Stay away, they take your money and dont ship your items that you order, when ask where is your order they issue partial refund, scammers. I would give -5 stars if there was a on optIon. Worst place to shop!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"All the reviews are fake don't trust the reviews, and when you rate something with 1 star and write a review, you'll be ghosted to others, meaning they won't be able to see your review, and you can't rate one thing, you have to rate every single item in your order. My order had a mixture of good and bad items yet I challenge you to find one item with less than 4.0 rating because you won't. Don't get fooled with the discount codes because they only apply to 10% of the products."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,They have hidden charges that i've seen first hand on my daughter's account. They also creep and have spider on your phone. They could do okay if they could run an honourable website. In the meantime my advice would be to uninstall it.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was just browsing and I was cut-off. Picked a few things I rarely see on Temu, Amazon shopping, or Wish. But I don't know what happened I'm getting ready to head back. 🦃😉 Happy Thanksgiving 🦃🌽🍎🌲 and Blessings to you."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible. The return policy is so trash, and they take days to get back to you, and if you put the wrong address, the whole experience will be ruined. It's just a scam, and you're better off going to Amazon and getting something there"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It was really lovely. At first, I had very little doubts about whether or not I should buy from shein . Once, I saw what my friend had bought. I was so intrigued . I had first tried it, and all the things I bought were lovely. I really recommend thanks, Shien (the return policy is very easy)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"how come points can only reduce 30% of the final price of the product, when it used to be 70%. I'll doubt that it also affected your sales since many people lost interest because of the update. and we also know y'all say ""good price of that quality"" blah blah blah but let's be honest they were overpriced. Please bring it back to 70%"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My previous review was good but I am changing it now. One star...... long time to recieve purchases..... why did you cancel the free shipping that used to be offered every week? No games anymore... no gifts... what the hell happened?
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Honestly shein is okay, they bring my order like I wanted. But the problem is the games, there are total scams because I had two phones to see if it was real but it's not I'm disappointed that shein has these scam games."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The app and products are unique and there is something for everyone. Unfortunately the courier they work worth steal your packages and offer no support so don't expect to actually receive any of your fantastic buys
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,No doubt all items are good and satisfying.but courier service is not good.I would advise you not to hire Brt Courier Service to retain your customers. They make it difficult to deliver the parcel to the customer.GLS is better than brt.

I will cancel the order hopefully I will get my money refund😡
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Shein no longer offer free shipping every weekend without a minimum spend. To qualify for free shipping, you now need to have a minimum order of 249 pesos which is sad, because I just usually order 100 pesos or below because i don't have much money. *Edited* Now, it's gotten worse😣😣 Can't use all my points now. It's really disappointingg, i always took months to earn point for bigger discount, but can't use it all anymore. Just please bring back the old shein policy!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,There tends to be a lot of errors on the mini games. They want screenshots of everything but they don't help fix the issue or help with any lost games or points or anything
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Getting better! The app still has its problems and sometimes searching items is weird but I love it all in all. I'm just very annoyed by other users spamming lyrics and emojis for reviews and points, which interferes with my shopping experience :( But I'm very thankful for the diversity in clothes and sizes and shop there pretty often!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good, love the discount whenever I buy in bundles. The only downside is the tracker.There were several days in which it stayed on ""Shipped"" without being updated. And I've always wanted to keep track of where my package currently is."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Shein is very nice i loved they're clothes is so genz😍😍 and the clothes is so cheap but have nice quality btw the only reason is you shein limit the points you cannot used which i hate it because before you can used all the points but right now you have a limit on it😔(shein pls dont limit the point that can be used huhu😭😭)
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I like shopping from SHEIN but unfortunately your app is not working properly at present. I have been trying to use it recently and it's not successful. Please fix it. Kind regards Liza
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My product are still in transit since 19th of Nov. Have write many times that i needed the products urgently. However, have gotten few of it elsewhere. I will like to cancel the order since the delivery is taking longer than the estimated time. 13working days now still waiting for the order to arrive. School would be going on break by next week and if i couldnt get it now it means i had to wait till next year. Shein your logistics sucks."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Not the same shein I use to shop with. The coins are limited in every purchased you buy unlke before where coins can be used to buy clothes for cheaper price. You cannot also use free shhipping fee in Saturdays and sundays anytime unlike before.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love the app. One thing I would like changed is instead of going 4XL, if things could be sorted by bust size since not all 4XL clothes fit the same? I feel that would really be helpful!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was super hesitant to purchase from an overseas online distributor due to a very bad experience, I tried them out this summer & bought some outfits for an island trip I was going on. Their prices were AMAZING so I figured it wouldn't be a huge loss if their products were terrible..BUT I was pleasantly surprised to receive cute clothes that fit well..my advice is to DEFINITELY read through the customer reviews & view the real pics if possible. I have ordered from them 3x & have been very happy!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I bought item from shein that were supposed to be shift from China to Brazil and they were worth around 28 USD which is below the taxation limit (<50USD) but my items were taxed and shein guieded me to refuse to accept because the tax was 60%. Its been more than 75 days but my money is not been returned and the items are stukked in Brazil. I tried to contact the shein customer service but they always forward me to the same page were it says that the items are in analysis for destination.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Too many issues with their shipping methods, and difficult to figure out how to get help --solution provided below only helps to talk to a bot that can't help with my delivery."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"even tho you save up points, you still won't save much anymore cos they lowered the percentage from 70% to 30%. they removed the weekend free shipping as well and only available for some items which f ing sucks :("
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love Shein! I order regularly and have never had any issues. I've never had to refund so unsure about the refund process. Arrival normally 10 days.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The shipping is horrible. Slow and broken. The service they use is Uniuni, who is already infamous. Can't even track my package properly. On top of that, there's no customer service. They lie and say their representatives work from 9-5 but you never get to talk to anyone. You don't even get to wait for one. If you have questions, you can either talk to auto-replies or leave a ticket, which never resolves anything."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love the clothes and the app, the only thing I don't like is the games they have to let you get free items or discounts I have $0.05 left and when I came back to it because the last person I needed to accept the invitation did it jumped up to $0.25 why is that?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm so excited about my new outfits that I purchased!! I got a few lingerie sets and a couple sleepwear sets as well that I've gotten from shein!

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Always wary about using Far East sites, so just placed a small order at first. Pleasantly surprised when it came really quickly. Also concerned about sizing, as clothes from similar sites have been small, but everything fitted well. Material isn't always top quality, but that's to be expected given the fantastic prices. If you look at the reviews with photos you can get a good idea of true sizing and quality, before ordering. Purchased many times since and not yet needed to return anything."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love this app I swear by sll it product and customer service I'd prompt and amazing variety of products priced well for people struggling.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Hate the new update you can't use ur points to the max. They decide on how much points you can use. me and my friends are slowly losing interest in shein that was sad because this is our girl things.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have used Shein for over a year and not have a complaint. I have found that you get what you pay for and the clothes fit well and are attractive. My only complaint is that I can't stop looking once I get on the app and usually buy more than I intended.

First of all, all of our packages have a locker drop off with very large lockers. All packages are brought to it unless a signature is required. Your poor parcel company did not complete delivery of my order. I will not shop through this app if you're going to have poor shipping service and then blame the customer."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very annoying, During delivery the drivers don't even call your phone for pick up, then later you get a notification that the delivery wasn't made due to no answer several times....."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have been using and shopping with Shein and i can truly vouch for them. 1. They have amazing customer serivice. I have reached tier 3 already bec. I have been buying for some time now with them. I had an issue with a package and they sorted it out so fast! 2. The packaging has improved! I started ordering last year and thr orders Ive been recieving this year are very well packaged! 3. Cheap price for the items but with quality!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"HORRIBLE!! My 1st order, and it never arrived. No shipping updates by either Shein or their transport carrier. Offering me a $4 credit on a loat $205 order is pathetic. Wont refund me either. Just send me emails in chinese writing that I have to translate saying 'sorry for the imconvenience'. GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Lovely app for shopping. Clothes and things are exactly as shown in the pictures. It's a bit expensive but it has really good stuff you won't get locally. Return and exchange process is simple. There is a return fee if you want a refund but exchange is free so that's good. Customer service is great. Had a little difficulty at first to locate the shein agents but when got there, they helped me within minutes. Overall I'm really happy with the selection they have. I recommend the app to everyone 😊"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Nice cheap stuff yes but they must improve on their communication system.They provide contact #s that doesn't go through even after wasting your airtime.Their whatspp is bad no response at all and not easy tracking your order.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Constantly woun't let me order things, asks for confirmation, then link wount work for confirmation, then an hour later candles my order, and the email for confirmation pops up at like 6am so sometimes I'm not even awake yet"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Had some OK things from shein but stopped ordering from them because I never received £36 worth of goods a d never got a refund either and trying to contact them was almost impossible as you were chatting with a robot who never understood...
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good so far, love looking at the clothes, currently waiting for an order to arrive, and planning my next order already lol. Super exciting stuff!! Has free trials for items, and loyalty schemes for rating and reviewing your orders. Such good fun. (update) clothes arrived both orders I love, only suggestion is to be able to go to someone's profile through review and see other things they have reviewed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The item came broke the front door of the the glass all shattered and I needed somebody to they look like they dropped it I need another way to say adore my breakfast item what somebody to get back with me about it I hope y'all have some extra glass put a door because of the other item it's okay
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Everything I've bought had been true to size and had arrived early or on time. So far I've had an excellent experience. P
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm so glad I found Shein. Being plus size, it is difficult to find clothes that fit well and are inexpensive. But Shein has thousands of styles in my size which are cute, sexy, and sooo affordable! I feel so much more confident. There's also a huge arrange of other items, too. And coupons, most items have many reviews to help make a decision, and free returns. Yes, I know it's not super environmentally friendly but it also isn't the worst company out there, either."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great service. AMAZING. Definatly not my last time using Shein. I got my packages with in 2 week wich is very very good service for international shipping to South Africa
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Rarely disappointed with anything I've ordered and the turn around on delivery is fast . Never any issues with App .
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The best platform shopping for me and my family. So many things that I can choose and buy in this shopping platform. Easy to use for other people too.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Your like constantly shoving ads in my face!!! I haven't even been able to download what's supposed to be free Wallpaper. Your miss leading and deciet-ful!!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall I love shein so much. Such cute things at a really cheap or reasonable price. Although when I was looking for a waterbottle they were all really expensive,even the pants. But otherwise everything else is amazing! One thing I think they should add is modest tops. Like whenever I see a shirt that's cute ,it's either expensive,cropped,backless or something else. But overall I love shein! Shein has my heart ❤️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is wonderful. its much cheaper than normal shops, and a lot better than temu. is not a scam, trustable, and overall perfect. ANYTHING you want or need is in this app. fully recommend."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It is a great app but takes forever to get to your house. It is also not thinking about how people react to certain things like a MoMo mask which is pretty rude to have a serious mask on sale which could be bad for some people to see so if you don't like jokes about something or anything like that don't recommend It's great for clothing but not for masks or other items I hope this is helpful I do use this app a lot so 6/10 from my opinion. Thanks for reading.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I placed an order very long ago it still hadn't come it's the worst I can locate my orders n it's been a long time people received their orders I can even track mine for some reason this genuinely frustrating
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Free gifts offer is a scam. Referred 2 friends who were new to shein and the balance never went down. It remains at 50p and unable to claim free gifts until the balance is 0.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I like the app after all but the prices charge more expensive for what it says and i keep getting anoying shein adds but i already downloaded it and after i press the x button it takes me right to shien and it wont let me get out😐
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Decent app I like the options my only issue is trying to get the coupons or the 5 free gifts they make it impossible to get I got 6 new people to make an account and it still wouldn't allow me my gifts
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used it last year, and i got a lot of nice stuff as pictures. Now i used it again and super disappointed. Price is high but i got trash instead. Bye shein i already delete app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love SHEIN, everything is good their prices are Awesome! You do take a risk like any online shopping of the items not fitting because you are not able to try them all before but their returns are fast and easy handle. In the other hand, their customer service suck because you can't talk to a live person, the app is perfect but we also need that last option of talking to a real person, other than that my kids and I Love it!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The price is great, but you can't find what you want. Like on Amazon and Amazon has a picture scanning option."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Your prices are great, much more reasonable than Temu, and I really like your selection. Though right now my budget is really tight. I get some money on the 1st of the month. I pray that your prices don't increase. Thanks Rick Turgeon"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love Shein, great choices,great value, great quality, the only problem i had was constant notifications but I've stopped them now."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They are overpriced, and there are people who use shein for scam. They tell you to like an item and then they deduct money from you. Be very careful. Don't know what is real or what is fake."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Shien dont get me wrong I love your items and I love buying things from y'all but your models need to not be so cury all the time. Alot of women have hip dips and we're not all curvy like that. It also makes a lot of females insecure because they thing they should look like that when they shouldn't.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Ordered quite a few clothes etc off here and there great:)and affordable prices to I always look at other reviews with the sizes.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's great, but on thing is the delivery time it arrives at the time it says it will but it is a bit of a long time like, 10 days then again I don't buy the fast delivery so yeah"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,the worst shopping experience ever when I put my phone number it couldn't work and alteration means the same number right? When I put the my phone number there it said it was different that not what goggle said Search it up yourself than NEVER DOWNLOAD IT
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I checked in everyday but still didn't get the coins. Everyday my coins amount never increases, always the same amount. Please look into this matter...please don't cheat"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I ordered like 15 items on December 8th for my daughter's birthday because it said it'll be here by the 16th. Her birthday has passed and it doesn't appear like it it'll be here before Christmas. This is supposedly ""Express"" shipping, I'll never buy anything from here again."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am very disappointed, My purchase was scheduled for delivery on November 2nd, then they changed the date to the 3rd, then to the 6th and now to the 7th. My question is until when will they postpone the delivery date???? One of the items I bought I no longer need, because I bought it elsewhere 😞😞😞😞"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Exceptionally good prices. Good quality. Timeously delivery. Overall good customer service. Sizes fit to quotations. I love to order from shein.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Shein is the best u get good quality and the service is fast you also get your money worth shein have been one of the most affordable shopping websites app you can also do an review on shein and make money.you can get free trial wow isn't that awesome 😀 an happy I using shein app
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love this app and the prices are amazing. Ordering and delivery is simple and easy. Products are great.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is one of the best fashion app out there for anyone on a tight budget, including me. Really easy to manage, though I wish there's a sub-category for sweatshirts and sweaters. A wide variety of unique and fashionable designs to choose from, all very affordable. Downside, material isn't exactly the best, but comfy enough to wear occasionally. I kind of killed my wallet on my first order but it's not too bad, shipping went smoothly. Shein is currently my main online fashion shopping app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ordered seasonal clothes for my fast growing kids in August, in preparation for the change in weather, its mid October and the clothes still hasnt arrived. It is very difficult to speak to anyone on the app, you get a bot leading you to questions you didnt ask. Over the past 2 weeks I've been calling the local distributors and all they do is escalate it. Since my kids need clothes I will have to get them clothes somewhere else, making my order redundant by the time it arrives."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I love shein but why bother to check in for points if they're gonna expire. the points I took several weeks to build suddenly expire within a week.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein so much,... excellent product quality, excellent value for money.... I always shopping here in SheIn since I download this apps, I like the products and affordable.🥰"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I've bought a few things from this app and it had very low quality and as soon as I found out it had games and tried to play it suspended my game play over me searching someone else's code who didn't even live in my household.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,For my family and friends birthdays I give them my phone and they shop using my app. Now I get only curve or teenage feeds. Also you need more colour choices eg different shades of blue
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They will act like they are gonna give you the best deals but always find a way to take it away as if they dont got people slaving away in they sweat shops for chump change yet they don't actually wanna throw deal 100 points is 1 dollar like what these cheap,fast fashion clothes dont last after one wear and y'all wanna act like y'all can't throw no deals just waisting my time have me send this link to everybody just to call me a cheater after I did nothing wrong y'all just mad it was that easy"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,So addictive..everything from Shein is such a bargain.. some clothes are kinda cheap so it pays to read the reviews before you purchase other than that..it's at a reasonable price if your not too bothered
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app had many ads do not download I tried buying a game for my son and the game was $173 and it charged me $196 + tax +shipping fees+local state taxes 👎 I thought this app was going to at least be helpful.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Well first they lost my shipment been lost for days so way late on the shipment took a week after said delivery date and only offer .50 cents as compensation a slap to the face do not use this app unless you like getting ripped off
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Why price low to high doesn't work?!?!? I don't want expensive clothes but now I'm unable to search. Won't order anything until it fixed!! I delete this 💩 I gave it a try. The low to high price listing still doesn't work. I delete it again.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My 1st order and it wasn't delivered on time. ETA is not true. Once it reached the Philippine courier Flash Express, the delivery and updates stopped moving."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"your lucky draw games are such a scam. I invited so many people and SUDDENLY when I'm close to 100 points, I can't invite people anymore. if you don't wanna give out coupons, stop suggesting it. Thats so rude. I hate it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I loved this app till they went with DHL. Every package I've ordered in the last 2 months has been put on hold till the point I've now had to call and they lost my package and it's been over 2 weeks but 7 days ago they just stopped looking for my last package. DHL is horrible! But now I've somehow lost some of my claimed points after just getting them thinking about never using Shein again after this.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's got good clothes. Another of different choices to pick from but delived takes ages. I ordered 2 cargo pants and it's been 2 weeks and still not delivered
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The shein app lags, everytime I look at items in my cart by clicking on them individually, the app will put me back at the top of the cart when I'm clearly not at the top"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Please shein fix your app. I can't check in and collect points anymore. And when I try to check in it always turn into blank white space. Please fix it.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have no faith in how this company operates. Every time I put multiple items in the cart, the totally magicaly is jacked up. Nothing is consistent"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like the products a lot. Up to now, the cost/ quality ratio has been really good. The only reason why I don't rate the app 5 stars is because the searching engine is not good. It is frequently difficult to find the products I'm looking for. AliExpress, for instance, has a much better searching engine, although it has other comparative shortcomings (e.g., time to delivery, taxes paying scheme)."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's good bt problem you only on delivery details why you only put ID, because other people they use passports and most of them they really want to support you bt it will be difficult to buy because they don't have ID cards they have passport"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I downloaded the app to stack up points so i could save money and buy clothes and such for cheaper price but the new update ruined it. I even recommended the app to my family but now i'm considering if i should just delete the app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Items ordered are not true too size ,way too small , and difficult to find information to get a refund . Better of looking in Poundland ."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Female clothes quality quite decent if the size if correct. Makeup stuff is terrible and not that great...Dont even bother buying Male clothing Watches etc its the worst quality.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Thanx for publishing the app. Would be nice if you can paste a link from Shein on the internet onto the app and it would read that link properly.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is me more or less asking for some help, I deleted my account like an idiot and would like to recover it, however whenever I've tried enquiring through email it tells me to put a complaint through customer service, but to do so I need to be logged in. I've not had much help so what do I do"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Woeful. Ordered my stuff on the 16th and i needed it by 25th and they still haven't gotten it to me. Now when it gets here, i have no use for it. Waste of money. Also stop sending offers to me BEFORE my stuff arrives!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"since the update i can't claim my points every check-in, when i tap the ""go check-in"" it don't appear and it will lag, but other than that it was a good app for shopping"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Fantastic stylish original designs! Such great selection of clothing. Much better than High Street at amazing prices!! I'm hooked!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"First time ordering. Came fast, was amazing product and cheap. Very suprised and amazed. Will defo be back to order more."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, from my last purchase on this app, I'm actually very disappointed. Charges me extra for stuff I didn't even want or put in my cart, and then I never received it. So ya, 1 star sounds right!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"App works great. Clothing is hit or miss. Often the fabric is cheap quality. Descriptions of items could be improved such as showing a close up of the material. If it wasn't for free returns, I would not order from here. Sizing is not standard, go by the measurements. I am happy with about 50% of what I order usually."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Everything I have ordered thus far have been accurate to description and size. They have arrived within the allotted timeframe if not sooner and without damage. I've never spent so much on an app before. It's my new addiction. Just know. You get what you pay for. They are great items with extremely great prices. Are they as luxurious as high end name brand.. no. But they are fun, flirty, and great quality for the price."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm new in Shein. Some of my friends recommended it, and I had to try it. From the little contact I've had with it, I'm really enjoying both the webiste and app designs. It's so well organized that the navigation through the page becomes really easy and smooth. The page provides multiple filters that help you to find just what you are looking for. Great!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Super customer friendly, easier to navigate that I thought it would be. The only thing that's confusing is when you have items in your cart and you start to go through the payment process, if you leave before putting in your payment information, they take everything out of your cart and call it an order already. But that's not even that bad, just differently organized than other apps would do."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely mind boggling amount of stuff on offer and the app is pretty good too. Very easy to navigate, favourite and save items to your cart. Checkout is as smooth as a baby's bum and it's great that PayPal is able to be used. The pricing on the goods is amazing. They have excellent savings coupons, we've placed an order consisting of 21 items which came to around $200 and with the 25% off on orders over $189 the de was reduced to $149. Excellent. Now waiting to see what the quality is like."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You don't have the right to make my pints that I have earned as when I received orders expired, that's illegal and unfair, I basically have paid for those points by ordering from your app, such point Should NOT have an expiry date EDITE : Dont be greedy shein, UPDATE the POINTS terms and conditions. so they will not expire"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I had problem with the cart. I selected various items but i didn't purchase them on the spot, i was gonna do it the next day but all the items in my cart were erased. Sucks that i have to spend more time trying to look for all the items I selected. Happened to me twice. Almost gave up but finally I ordered now i have to wait like a month to get my stuff😩. And my other problem is they wont let you use multiple coupons only one per purchase."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Always get stuff on time and good quality
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's the best online store with best customer service! Everything in this store is very stylish and affordable🤗 I get compliments on every single item I buy from Shein, it barely happened before🤭 and their agents are very customer friendly! I was just curious if the item was returnable because its color came slightly different from the picture and he refunded the whole amount without returning! I'm so thankful to SHEIN and the only thing I could think of is to leave a review for being so nice!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein's customer service is great! If you have a problem, they respond promptly and sort out the problem quickly. The delivery is also efficient. The goods are of the same quality as advertised and I have experienced good quality with everything that I have bought from Shein. Choose well and you will receive accordingly. Read the reviews and decide carefully. The app is user-friendly and works really well too."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I've bought over 10 products the same week. There is a lot of great stuff here. Most products are good but not really. Some flaws in shein are their products and return policies. I've tried returning items that I did not even order and items that were faulty and not my size. But when I tried to I couldn't it would always freeze. Anyways other than that it's pretty cool app. Just be careful bc it's time consuming shopping all these possibilities.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is a good place to shop. Good prices, discounts and easy to accumulate points. The app makes it easy to follow your purchase ( though some updates on logistic would be welcome though its not entirely their fault) they are fast to provide you with return options. My only problema with Shein is their customer service. Their live chat never seems "" live"" and sends you in a loop. But their ticket system responds faster."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent service to date. Love the vast choice of clothes whatever the season. ❤ A*** However, Shein,Sizes of foot wear could be improved to accommodate UK sizes, as I'm a small UK size 3. Only appears to have Euro & others, are much to large. I mean ""Why have clothes for small women, if you can't choose the shoes of UK 3"" .?? Also the App isn't , user friendly to navigate"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great option for summer holiday. I bought a bumper amount for my holiday as I'd, aherm ""grown"" so had to order up a size. Ego dented but not my purse, I was really pleased with the selection, lightweight material and designs I bought as well as being able to buy a number of options of swimwear. In previous years I had two options and this felt luxurious to be able to switch and change every few days 😃 Definitely recommend. Despatched within timescale and some ahead of."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Really unimpressed with any response to shipping issues. No updates in over a month and can't speak with anyone.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've bought 5 items on shein (waiting for 4 more) and I haven't had a bad order yet. From what I've seen, the clothes are super cute and good quality. Sometimes the pictures dont match the product, so always check the reviews. And then understand that sometime the cheaper stuff might not be of the best quality, because you get what you pay for. Overall though I've been really satisfied with their service"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I never got any problem so far. The app is very user friendly, easy to navigate. The delivery was never late, always on time or earlier which is great! I dont have any problems with the items delivered too, always well packed and the sizes I ordered were also correct. So far, it was great for me. I think the only concern I have right now, its a bit pricey. 😅"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I randomly found Shein as a shipping app while looking for a specific style of boot. I downloaded the app because I saw a bunch of cute styles for great prices. I thought it was going to be like wish and take forever with the shipping and the price of shipping. It didn't I found really cute items for affordable prices and they even let me break down my purchase into 4 installment payments without a credit check and shipped them immediately.. Shein is great! I can't wait to get my new items.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,What superb quality and service! My package was on time as promised. The quality is stunning and I am a very happy client. Thank you!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've never had more stressful shopping experoence before I used this site.. the problem with shein is with exchange and refund policies. So I brought this product from shein and the size was incorrect, wanted to exchange it but there's no such option given on site, so I put it on return. Then I took effort to get in touch with customer service. Not easy either. And told them I wanna exchange it with the same money. They assured me it would be done. However when the product came I was asked to pay for the product as well as delivery charges. I didn't get any refund amount in my shein wallet... Had it been once I would have considered it a genuine mistake. Before that also I had ordered something and had problem with return. Specially not understanding y do I pay for delivery then return and then re delivery. I've been shopping online ever since online shopping as evolved. Have never had any issues but this site is a complete ""No"". I would never consider shopping again from here..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Using the app is pretty easy & simple, the added rewards with points for adding reviews helps when purchasing item, it's good to see actual photos of the products. Descriptions are usually spot on for me as is the clothing sizes. Going through the purchasing process & cancelation process are easy & it's cool that they reimburse your vouchers & points if you cancel. Overall haven't had a bad experience, only con is I wish they had more clothing in my style that wasn't so revealing or polyester."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I really don't like that Shein automatically selects a $.99 cent ""guarantee"" to the shipping costs, even for free shipping. That extra fee shouldn't even be necessary because credit card companies will reverse charges on undelivered orders. It's placed in a spot that's very easy to overlook when submitting an order, or remember to remove it. For this reason I'm going to limit future purchases from Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Lots of range of options which is great, really good value (in some cases - quality is a bit hit and miss but overall good). HOWEVER, there's been a lot recently about accout hackings, people's bank details are being stolen and data is being sold on the dark Web, so don't recommend risking placing an order unless you're prepared to take that risk."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So I was playing the lucky draw game featured through the app and after completing the game it won't allow my friend to join because the game ended on May 31,2023. Kinda pissed off about it"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Really good but would recommend adding a dark mode feature for thoses who think its a bit to bright with the white but still good though
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like the clothing options they have and some stuff is great quality, and other things they have are not so great quality I wish everything they offered was great quality but then again the pricing is great too its extremely affordable and the sizing is sometimes way off so its a little difficult to chose proper sizes I wish that was easier so I would definitely recommend reading reviews before you purchase so you know if you need to size up or down but overall I like the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Heard a lot about this app having lovely collection of clothes. However, it is very dissappointing to share that the order was vanished after the online payment. I had order 2 dresses and paid online via Google Pay(Tez), however, when i went to see the tracking details, it says no orders in the list. I would personally not recommend this app to anyone. Very disappointed"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This is absolutely by far in my whole entire life is the worst customer service.. impossible to talk to someone.. do not order or participate in these games.. worse than Temu
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I've been loving this app and the clothes are super cute but I'm the past week for some reason when I'm looking at product reviews and click the pictures to enlarge the screen just goes black. I've even tried uninstalling and installing again and it didn't fix the issue! My favorite feature is being able to see how the clothes fit on different body types but that's difficult to see in the tiny pictures. Please fix!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Be aware, although they say otherwise, Shein does not deliver to your home, you have to collect orders from the post office."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is super reliable, has genuine service providers and it's easy to use. Love the options, the filters. I would work on: 1. keeping the filter settings for options that come up after selecting a product. 2. Have an easier way of changing shipping addresses for sending gifts to other people. Overall, I love the app and I'm sooo addicted to shopping on it. Keep up the great work Shein!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"You get what you pay for. I wish you could update your reviews on this site. Once in awhile I get something decent quality, most of the time especially bathing suits are sewn wrong, backwards and almost all the bottoms are thongs. Please sell full bottom bathing suits!!! The tops are tiny and bottoms are always 2 sizes too big and go up the butt. I have gotten a couple good quality t-shirts. I wish you could return bathing suits, what a waste of money."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The best thing about this app is that when you click on an item, it shows you 30 more similar styles/ colours/ designs so it allows you to find exactly what you're looking for. The items are good quality and cheap! Delivery takes about 10 days to the UK. Shein always gives discounts and freebies too! Can't fault it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love shein but I don't like the limit on there but shein is the best clothing app ever
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app I see so many clothes I like and there are affordable prices I think you guys should open a store
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I honestly love Shein. I've had a few items I didn't like out of the dozens I purchased, but it's the same with any store. The assortment of plus sized fashion is unparalleled anywhere. The shipping is a reasonable speed and easy to track. I also love that you can break up your payments with Clearpay. They always have tons of vouchers that same you a lot of money. Overall great experience."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely good, I recommend everyone to use it it's very good in sizes ❤️😊"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Shein app pushes you to visit their app. Like I'm using messenger and no ads pop up, suddenly I'm on the app already. It happens like 3x a day and that's inconvenient because you need to go back and exit this stupid app. That's not the notification because it is disabled and even if it is not, the app shouldn't open that instantly without really opening it and now I'm worried about my information being hacked."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Love this app, on it daily. Great to navigate easy to understand and great customer service too. Only problem is with the store itself, I wish it had better options for petite, eg, they only have 12 maxi dresses but for normal length there's 100s. Same with trousers. Certain clothes I can shorten but it's difficult with pleats or chiffon maxi dresses or wide leg trousers. Took 2 stars off for that"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's a really good app but just some times it glitches a lot ☺️🤩👍🏾
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is a good little app but it feels a bit buggy or unrefined. Filters are a bit average and don't particularly help with finding something specific. A lot of scrolling later due to multiple posts of the same item. There is a lot of potential to grow customer base by improving mens clothing styles, colors and options. So far the pricing (even with discounts) did not come close to competing with retailers for basic fashion. It's fun but essentially not where I'd recommend buying to others."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein, it's my new go to for my kids' clothing. Most items are much cheaper than anywhere else, but please read the reviews before ordering! Sometimes the fabric can be a bit iffy, reviewers often post pics which are really helpful and you can get an idea of sizing. Although everything I've ordered so far has been bang on. Oh, and give each order 1 to 2 weeks to be delivered. All items are packaged well and the clear Shein ziplock bags are brilliant. 😊"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app and so many choices so it impossible to not find TONS of things you'll love! You can make it personal to your size, preferences, and style for any occasion. More categories then clothing for women too including men, kids, babies, pets, and home decor! Prices are very reasonable and they have almost too much of a selection! Tbh tho...Too many notifications to your phone tho so that gets annoying."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like shopping in the app. It's a very smooth experience and the quality of the clothing is good. My only complaint is points expire. Why?!?! I think points should be available for whenever you want to use them, at least let the accumulate to a decent discount before they expire ($10+)."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I recommend Shein to literally everyone. Out of 100s of items I've ordered I've been disappointed in maybe 3. I spent $90 and recieved 21 things. At the mall I spent $100 on 4 items of clothing. If that doesn't speak for the pricing, I don't know what does. The app is relatively easy to use, it makes buying from them and rating clothes better, I'd download if I were thinking about buying from them. And you should buy from them."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The stuff are fine. Price is borderline ok. The app interface is also fine. Navigation is easy. Buy boy oh boy Shein is poor at account management. I cannot see any order I've placed in the past. It's like I never ordered a thing. And oh yea, different sites give different products. Eg when using US site, I cannot see baby shoes but if I chose to select Jamaica as the shipping address, it shows shoes for babies."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"SHEIN is really high quality, Shipping is really fast and everything on amazon can be found on SHEIN. I placed several large orders now, and just recently a very large order got stuck at Canadian customs (?) I declined a refund that customer support offered promptly because I wanted the package to come, so I waited a month and SHEIN sent me a replacement order + any unavailable items I got to pick new ones. I highly recommend shopping on SHEIN *I use my browser and don't have the app installed*"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Ordering through their app is very easy. My package took only 5 days to arrive and I was able to track it every step of the way. When I received my clothes they were exactly how they were in the picture and made very well. The sizes run a little smaller but I was able to order a size larger and that worked out well. Very pleased overall and I look foward to placing more regular orders!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Look, I don't bother to rate or review basically ever. But between me and my mother, we have bought 150+ items and every. single. item. was excellent. Quality is great, usually comes pretty fast though right now it is a bit slower, and by God we're both big ladies with wildly different styles and body types and we still are able to find clothes that are cute, comfortable and fit wonderfully! I get compliments on my items from Shein, I feel confident wearing them. I encourage people to buy Shein!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I think the reviews could be reviewed first so as not to confuse consumers. Sometimes they don't make any sense and are more confusing than helpful. The material is bit or miss. Sometimes it's right on target and other times it's lackluster at best. So, it's 50/50 for me. I don't like that points expire with the attempt to get me to spend more often. If I earned the points they should remain until I use them."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Fantastic website and most clothing reviews are pretty accurate. Never had a problem with an order, they all arrive and all the clothes have always fitted me. Great quality material and really comfy outfits. Returns are really easy to do as well. Only ever had to return one item and that was just simply because it didn't suit my figure. I would highly recommend shein to anyone. There Is literally something for everyone on there."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shipping is pretty fast, the packaging is always clean and crisp. My only issue with some of the clothes is the Spring summer attire can be thin in material. But for the most part everything else that you get is just like the photos and you can get lots of points and discounts from leaving reviews.. It's just an attractive app where you can can find any look for any type of esthetic."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Finally! Shein points is now working. I don't know if they notice my comment but overall there's no more white screen on the shein check in points interface. Thank you so much Shein Developer! 🥰

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love it, everything is really well priced and pretty good quality. They also have things for almost every category, especially clothing and accessories, which have a very wide variety and style aswell (also includes plus sizes, most up to 3X-5X I believe)! It's very easy to acquire free shipping, which I fancy because I honestly hate paying for shipping, lol. I shop here a lot though, haven't been let down yet!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm addicted to the cute clothes and good deals on this app. However, I have had issues receiving some of the no-return items, and I wish there was a way to at least rectify the mistake (wrong bow the first time and the clip broke the second time). Cheap items, but it's still a bummer to receive either the wrong item or a broken one."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Great app very cute clothes.... I have ordering since last year. Only problem is the delivery company buffalo logistics has poor poor service they don't deliver in time they don't even inform you that they will be delivering.... very disappointed with them
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love this app. All of the clothes are so easy to find and the clothes themselves are absolutely amazing. The clothes come in a zip lock bag and are far from being damaged on the way to your doorstep. Paying is so easy as well. Its quick and easy and adding things to your bag and wishlist are like baby steps. I HIGHLY recommend this app. 10/10!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love the clothes, however you have to really look at the reviews before you buy something, and I highly recommend measuring yourself. I've had to buy everything in large because a small and medium doesn't fit me. On other websites such as missguided I would easily fit into a small and a medium would sometimes be a little too big for me. In this case a large is actually small for me. Also, the quality of the material in both clothes, bags and jewellery varies. Bit of a hit and miss tbh. Xx"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love it. Very stylish and unique finds for a very affordable price. If you search it you will find it. It's so much more than shopping for clothes and shoes, a big variety of things to look at and shop for. From sofa covers to nail glue, it has it all. Shipping isn't expensive and you get your stuff in good condition. Amazon was my favorite above all and now shein is becoming that app I go to everyday to see something new and for a great price."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"a lil bit of false advertising, which really sucks"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I like this app...they got a good collection of 80's style but the problem is the fabric and the pattern that has been used for most of the product is same..so it becomes difficult to buy the things that u like with the same fabric and design again and again. Moreover the delivery and return time is too long which makes me sick most of the time.even if i want to order I just ignore because of the delivery time...
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's alright i guess, mostly buy sport shorts/pants on the men section. The rest of the clothings, specifically women, seems to be only for a stick or very skinny people. And even if there's a section for overweight, it is still too tight to the skin and very ostentatious. In other words, too exaggerated and with no relaxation. May keep buying, but will certainly search a lot, be very picky, and for the female clothings, it will be to use at home only."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great app great outsourcing. I will build off of your as far as outsourcing is concerned and financial stability I love your app. Tech#1 Platform Beta
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Ordered some dresses.. For the 4-5th time but this time I had an issue with it not coming.. That it was ""Undeliverable"" for some dumb reason. Shein customer service pretty much telling me its not their problem and I gotta do their job, contact the place they use to ship, and figure it out myself. A PROFESSIONAL business would've handled the issue instead if passing the issue off on me. Definitely lost a loyal Customer."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,love this app but wish they had a suggestion box to suggest products an brands 😀
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Low quality clothes and items.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein has a wide range of clothes, from long and elegant, summer dress to mini casual dresses etc. They're design is what catches my eyes. Beautiful colours that you won't find in normal high street shops. Also sizes are very accurate, which is a bonus when you shop online. I absolutely love my dresses I bought from shein. Reviews from other customers, also really helps because most of the time they reflect the actual dress and pictures attached also helps to imagine your self in a dress."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love the prices for everything! Love the coupons to help you save. Shein really does care about students and people when it comes to pricing. It's great that I can also pick and choose what I want to see in my recommended. Only a couple minor annoyances like losing all of the stuff in my bag when I cancel payment. But overall, great shopping app :)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app has come along way. I didn't like this app at first 6 years ago(came back because of a YouTuber) . The app was horrible, the clothes terrible(sizes and style) and the customer service was complete trash. Now this is my number one shopping app. The improvements are incredible form better selection of clothes to a better interface(phone/computer). I'm loving SHEIN and can't wait to see what it has in store for the future"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The experience is good so far. I like the fact that everything is carefully measured and you need to measure yourself as well before ordering because some things can't be returned to Shein which is understandable. The reviews and pictures are so many, I like the fact that I can read those and decide whether to purchase something or not. The coupons and discounts are awesome. I think I'll order from Shein all the time."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Prices have gone up and I don't have any coupons to use at checkout
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love Shein!! I haven't had a problem with the app. The clothing items I bought are made of good quality material compared to some items I've bought from other brand name stores. SHEIN prices on there clothing are great and you will be surprised at the quality of their products. You can get addicted 😄!! They have great coupons and free shipping coupons that also lower the total price at checkout 😉! Great overall experience so far!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Although the clothes are pretty, the quality overall is very ""Chinese"". Always read the reviews before buying as most things are photographed very well but do not look the same on arrival. Size charts are mostly incorrect- again, read the reviews first. Customer support mostly stays unavailable, the best you can get is the manual chat, where you might be better versed than the rep. Overall, NOT WORTH YOUR TIME. There is too much quality and good competition out there to let you feel like a pampered online shopper. Let China deal with this!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shein in now my #1 go to when it comes to online clothes shopping. I absolutely adore it. The clothes are always good quality and you get exactly what you're sold. My only query is that delivery times (to the uk) are very long, even with express delivery, it takes about 2 weeks. Other than that, shein is an amazing app and if I was the type of person who casually recommended apps to friends, I would definitely recommend this."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great sales! This week, my order arrived just 11 days after I placed it, and it had 4 dresses, a tankini top, and a belt for just under $55 USD -- including free shipping! 4 whole dresses, people! And they all fit perfectly, thanks to personalized size recommendations from SHEIN plus customer reviews. I deducted a star because you do get frequent push notifications, which make it too tempting to spend more money. LOL"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I deleted the app. Such scam behaviors! I added some items to my cart looking for others. I checked my cart today, something was strange, the items were double price. I have screenshots not only the sale price got changed but for some the original price was higher as well, I was shocked that original price did not change for some items but the sale price got higher. I have never seen a brand doing this in my entire life."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I am very pleased with the many options of products to chose from. Everything is great quality. Customer service is EXCELLENT. I do not like that shoe sizes are confusing and it's very difficult to decide for every single pair even after receiving and trying. Also the fact that products with final sale can not be returned. Another very negative thing is products ""sell out"" very fast. Then somehow they are available again when I purchase. But not the ones that I don't. Generally very confused."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Shein is the best but I still think that more should be done, for example can't order more than 100 item and also the shipping cost is just expensive"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have placed several large orders so far and the only problem I had was that the sliders I found for my husband and boys is that they were too tight which made it impossible for them to put their foot in fully. I constantly have a great coupon 10% off but it has to be for an order over $49(?) For free ground shipping... Another is 15% off but has to be over $99 and get free expidited shipping. Plus there is 4 payment option also... I've spent days shopping...
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a great online store. Despite what it's classy-sounding name may suggest, they actually have some cool, unique, and amazing finds at cheap prices (a gay pride bracelet I found on it was a little cheaper from Shein than it was on Amazon, for the EXACT same bracelet), even with the tax and shipping & handling fee! And clothes & accessories aren't all you'll find on it. I once found art stuff. Wishlist is helpful, and they even have a ""similar items"" button for sold-out items."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Horrible experience with this company. The carrier they use DHL has not delivered my package, and Shein can not re ship my order. I have been reaching out numerous times, and they will not help. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I received my order neatly organized in individual pouches in case of any return. The fabric of the clothes is good. That's my main concern and the sizing. I ordered xl- large even if the fabric has a little stretch or none at all since it was my first order. Only regret is that I did not receive one of the items which was a bracelet. I am ordering it again since it was cheap. I hope to get it this time. Overall rating 4 out of 5 stars. I expected less and I am quite impressed. I'm satisfied
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I downloaded it today and will delete, the amount of notifications you receive is unbelievable, and I wanted to switch off but very complicated"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really really adore this app! I am literally addicted to it. Its user friendly, products are incredible and so reasonably priced. There are coupons for days! Contests you can even enter and everything is of great quality. App has no glitches and you can follow people, you can leave reviews. There are free trials for clothing and even makeup. They have everything you could ever possible need and it's a great place to buy gifts and beauty products. Sizing is accurate. Recommendations good 2!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very user-friendly, easy to navigate, lots of helpful features that make up for not being physically there to check out your item. Excellent tracking system. Outside the app, delivery to NZ can take up to two weeks. Through the tracking system you can see exactly what process the order is up to, when it's in customs, in transit, sitting with local courier... No major issues with the company, have only had one item not included in a package and found the cs team easy to deal with and prompt."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love this app, alot of options for great prices. Everything ive ordered so far has looked just like the pictures, sizing is a little hard to decide on but as long as you look threw their reviews on the product and compare 9 times outta 10 you can guess the correct size to order. Wish their standard shipping was a little quicker. Getting a hold of anyone in customer service to answer question is a little ridiculous. Wish I could connect with a real person over the phone or threw their messenger"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Good app and pretty easy to use. Love the outfit challenges fun to do. The only complaint I have is how the categories and searching for certain types of clothes is set up. When using the search bar you almost have to be very specific in what words you use or it acts like it doesn't know what you are looking for. And using just the pre set categories can be overwhelming at times with too many clothes to go through. Just browsing it's fine but not when looking for a certain piece.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've ordered quite a few things from here. They always come to me nicely packaged with no issues. The shipping isn't bad at all and sometimes things come in before the estimated date. The app always has great deals, chances to get free shipping no minimum, coupons on already cheap items. Much like anything their are some bad quality items that don't last long so read the reviews. Overall though Shein has really great quality items especially for their cheap prices."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I find the ap easy to use. The clothes are super cute and great quality AND AFFORDABLE! Have only had 2 orderes thus far but they shipped out almost immediately and even the package from china arrived wayyyy faster(I think less than 2 weeks) than other sites who's product ship from there. One thing I wish I could change is I cant figure out how to edit/update my reviews.. I think perhaps bc they haven't been approved yet(since they contained pictures)?
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein! Great app to use. Majority of the time what I order is perfect! (19 out of 20) However, there are those rare occasional orders where the material and manufacturing just isn't what I would like. Overall, though, very easy app to use, quick shipping, good customer service, and the prices are phenomenal! Give them a shot!"

Now I'm just going to be vocal about local 😊"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I enjoy shopping with SHEIN. The quality can be hit and miss but for a cosplayer looking for outfits is a good deal. I have only been unhappy with a few items but what I have been happy with I continue to buy. I really wish that when looking at an outfit that they would list all items that the model is wearing. I have a hard time putting an outfit together so adding the ability to look at all the items means I could buy the whole outfit.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Lost packages, if you order and the tracking info says delivered but you can't find your package anywhere forget about your items or your money, I've contacted shein, ups and PayPal to get my money back and the 3 of them send you to each other to shift the responsibility. I've been a shein customer for the last 3 years, now I won't ever be ordering anything else."

Eventually the points that you accumulated so far will not fully be applied and only a certain amount will be and the past daily sign in is much better than this updated version. I hope the developers take user feedback into account and address these issues promptly. Until then, my rating stands at a regrettable one star."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Tracking number has been available for 3 days but does not work Not updates on progress Keeps asking you to review and repurchase items that hasn't even arrived yet.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The products are average but at low cost. The customer service experience is horrible . And the refund process is frustrating. Cos the customer service can never agree that the refund is incorrect..I still shop there I give a higher rating to shein for the shopping but the customer service is like at a 1/10. Shein can compete with Amazon in price but not at customer support. The customer support is non existing actually and is manned by untrained workers.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great quality for the price. Caters very well to plus sizes. If you don't mind waiting 2 weeks for delivery then it's worth it. Still wouldn't reccomend exclusively shopping here or filling your entire wardrobe with these items. Not good for basic pieces but great for fads or trends you want to try for cheap.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Obsessed. Some of the products aren't great quality but the majority of what I've bought from Shein has exceeded expectations. Can't beat the prices. Sizing is easy to figure out as well. You can convert to cm or inches. You can filter the sizes and the reviews and read the ones from people around your general measurements. 90% of the time, sizing is correct and I've only had to exchange twice and it was an easy process."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm in love with this store. Was a little Leary about ordering because of the such low prices but everything I've ordered so far has been great. Doesn't look cheap at all. The sizing is a little tricky just make sure you read the reviews on that item before you buy it. Especially with the men's stuff, from what I've ordered ,sizes were a little small. The worst part about ordering from them is waiting to get it. The return process is easy and fast too"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Bought 3 things, 1 got removed because there were no items left. I checked and there were indeed items left. Chose Refund because I had no exchange options and I got nothing back. Edit: I ordered it a week ago, with expedited shipping Edit2: I ordered a new product, similar to the one that i canceled, and that one got canceled as well."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely love SHEIN, I do almost all my shopping here. The only reason for three stars is because its extremely frustrating that they don't allow the option of updating email addresses. Technology has come such a long way, you should be able to update your address rather than forced to create a whole new account. Kinda sucks for those who've earned a high level & lots of points that would simply be gone because there's no other option but to lose everything & create a new account."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I paid extra for express shipping which was estimated to arrive in 5-7days. It has now been 14 days with no update of when it is to be delivered. I have reached out to the ""customer service"" number. It is just a machine when called and when texted it only responds once a day. Highly frustrating and highly inefficient. Will not order from again."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm pissed. I had over 70 items in my save for later. I have the app. I'm always logged in. Everything iv saved it's all gone. I'd have to go and find it all again. I guarantee I won't, there's so much stuff on the sight! I'm very disappointed because I was about to make a hugeeeee shein hall and buy everything in my wishlist I only had time to add 9 item to my bag and for some reason they stayed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,You can see variety of products but the measurements are totally different than the standard ones. And it's delivery service is the worst. It took 15 days than the actual date and when I returned one item they came immediately for the pick up. Their refund service is pathetic as they add money to shein wallet after 20 days from pick up date. It wasn't a pleasant experience shopping here. I don't think I'll visit again.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm hopeful that your promotional plan undergoes an update, reverting to its previous state. I'm committed to accumulating points daily, yet the current system only allows us to utilize 30% of the points earned. I eagerly anticipate the return to a 70% utilization rate, as it significantly impacts affordability. Unfortunately, the recent changes have rendered it less budget-friendly. Before the update, I used to place orders almost once a month, a frequency that has become unattainable."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I think that this app is very good if you don't have a lot of money or if you choose to have cheaper clothes, it has such good recommendations for you, but when you buy curtain clothes it comes in the rong size or has a different material than the picture it shows you, other than that it is a really good place for makeup, skincare, clothes etc, but other than than the cothes comming in the rong size or material it is generally a good app, would definitely recommend for sure!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very poor quality clothing. Material is thin, and they never wash well, one of my daughter's Shein tops completely shredded after one wash. It might seem cheap, but it's still a complete waste of money. Also, the competitions are a complete scam, you invite the required number of people, and Shein just resets the amount you need to invite, telling you to invite more people to win. This means you can never add enough people to actually win. Making a competition unwinnable is false advertising!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is one of the best decisions I've made in a long time. My entire wardrobe is Shein! Out of the hundreds of things I've ordered, only 2 came broken and they have a return policy for items like that anyways! Great service, I always get my clothes within 2 weeks on normal shipping and everything is super affordable! It's really great for holidays! They also include animal supplies, home accessories, electronics accessories and tons of clothing from petite to plus, even men's!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I use shein for junk journalling supplies and it never fails! It's so cheap and the variety is great. Sometimes the picker packing your order is a bit lazy and gives you double of the same thing when clearly you want different designs of the same product. That's happened a few times. I've ordered over 300 products from shein and over all I'd give them a 7 out of 10
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I got items and received an update that the items were delivered on the 7th of December. Till date I don't know where my items are. I checked and I provided the correct address. Iv sent countless emails to customer service and they keep telling me to go to my local post office, I did and the items are not there either. This is very bad, and considering the fact that this is the first time am buying from them"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I shop on this site like a bad habit. Love the clothing and shoes. Everything I order fits perfectly. I only had to send one pair of shoes back due to my uneducated guess between US and EUR sizes, but the shipping is quick, always arrives a day or two early. Sending g the shoes back, my money was back in my account with in 24 hours! There are great deals and you can't beat the points you get when you check in...all 'n all, best clothing site ever!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great service and good clothes if you choose wisely. Affordable prices. If you have items missing in your order you must send the photos of your package so they can refund you. So I advise that you take a photo of your package before and after. My follow up review the delivery in SA has changed to PAXI. They don't deliver you have to collect. For that they lose one star Ok a year later they are now delivering again . So we are back to 5 stars.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Super fast shipping, quality items at very low cost. App works well with filters to find what you want. I only wish they had more plus size models, and featured plus size collections. And I love that they have men's clothing, but there's a need for larger sized men's apparel too. It's SO easy to fill up a cart with great unique finds. Adding more plus sizes will just make for a bigger order!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It used yo be good, but now the coupons don't apply to my cart items. There is no way to tell which stores will be pay for the coupon, so I can't get the cart with items that will allow the coupon to work. I have earned many coupon, they simply do not work for my cart. Prices have increased. I will return to Taobao."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Ordered dresses thru sister account now have my own account so i can order more dresses loved my dresses and so happy with them
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, there is no glitches if you accidentally order you can cancel it right away, my shein order always comes a day early whenever I order and I'm so happy with the fast delivery, the quality of the product is phenomenal. None of my items came damaged. Recommend this app 100%"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"With Shein you never know what you may find or what condition the products will be in or if your package will even arrive. I have had my package come early and things fit and be super cute. But 9/10 I end up returning something because it's damaged/falling apart or doesn't fit. The sizes are also a toss up sometimes it says its my size and it's actually not, usually too small, but every once in awhile it is true to size. I usually shop in plus size because of this. Make sure to read the reviews."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Quick shipping! Lots of items!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very affordable items and good quality 😊😊
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I have looked at a thousand other websites but this one caught my eyes! Very fashionable with affordable prices. I have yet to receive anything so I will provide an update to the quality of my items. Update: I absolutely love the clothes I purchased. Everything fit perfectly except the shoes. The return process was hassel free! I'm extremely excited to get my summer dresses and bathing suits for my vacation!!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like the app as a product because it keeps me glued with daily check ins and points. But the server doesn't function well most of the time, there is no option to choose multiple coupons, and I wish had a separate category called ""today on sale"" because everyday their tops of $20 goes on discount to $12 and I don't have any options of getting notified unless it's in my wishlist. Still needs better category and filter options, needs better size guiding and material explanation."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Easy, convenient and so much choice!. They cater for all sizes so you're going to find something that fits. Lots of different styles too from modest to daring. My only criticism would be that there are some gorgeous styles that are let down by the material being a bit thin. I would pay a bit more for better material. Saying that they do have a category which is slightly higher end. The silk tops are stunning."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Nice clothes and at the affordable price
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing for the price ,quality,schedule date and the services 👏 👌 really many experiences with the Sheim really 👌 specially the time to get your stuuf comparing with all aliexpress temu amazon no compare"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You can't get refunds or cancel the package even before it's shipped. You can't contact anyone if the package wasn't received, or even before that. There's a bit that answers to you.. not a human, and it only gives you the contact information once your package is delivered. You need the tracking number to contact someone, but after delivery it takes the tracking number away, so there's no way to contact anyone. There's no way in hell I'm ordering here again. I heard many others had this happen."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used to love Shein and bought many times from it, really loved the clothes too. But now they removed the feature of only choosing cotton items to shop. Why would you remove that feature, i don't want to buy anything in poliéster or rayon or similar material. I can only wear breathable fabric, and now my shopping experience has turned bothersome and difficult."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"At first the quality of the items I bought was excellent. I was very impressed of the fit, designs, colors & excellent packaging. However, as I started buying in bulks more often the quality of items delivered dropped. It started from wrong colors then to poor quality of clothes (stiching and missing buttons), defective items and wrong sizes. Overall, the quality of service & items has become sloppy the more items I bought. It's very disappointing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I had to uninstall the app because the absolutely invasive ads on other platforms kept opening the shein app all on their own. Hasn't happened with any other ads, only shein. I can't even watch videos because it keeps going to freaking shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,One star for: advertising with fake X (close) buttons so people press it and open the play store / app. Fake Gambles where one always wins prices trying to convince to pay more money. Fake reduced prices timer. And all the other sneaky methods trying to get people to interact with the app and buy things one actually doesn't need
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Points are not really useful now. Like before they let us use it all even in one items. And also the clothes size xs is no longer nicer. Specially maxi dress. Not enough items to choose! very long for asian women. Specially 4'11 height. Need to be 120 cm is good. Need something to choose for 4'11 height.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great place ro shop, soo many options and varieties to choose from. Great pricing also, lengthy shipping which isn't unusual for me since I also shop from other places with the same shipping speed but the low prices (most times) makes it easier to afford express shipping. Always shop from them and the quality is also good, may not be the greatest but no complaints, they aren't expensive or high end items."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There are too much ads of this app. I didn't download this app but this is giving me ads . When I skip the ads 1 minutes later this come back again and again . This is to frustrating.I have a a business in mobile ,for this app I can't do anything. And this is causing business lose"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really love the interface of this app. I'd say my favourite part is the comment section since it's very useful to get an idea of how to style items or if I will wear it considering my body shape. However, the one thing I'm not a fan of is the poor Photoshop work in some photos of the models waistlines and cleavage. I find it very unnecessary and fake."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was kind of hesitant to try Shein because of the incredibly low prices, but I was very pleasantly surprised!! I love the daily points, all the coupons/sales, and just how fast and easy it is to use and find either the things you were looking for, or things you may have never even known you wanted! Theres styles for everyone and I've found some incredibly comfortable, cute clothes"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"App very easy to use, can track my order and review products once they arrive! The only issue I have is the quality of some items and the size can vary from excellent to terrible. Pot luck with the quality your getting. Which is why it is so cheap. However for that price you still receive some decent items."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love this app! They have a wide selection of clothes and wigs and jewelry and makeup. Once you figure out what size you need everything is a lot smoother. I like how you can like a item and it saves in your liked section. I just wish the points were worth more money off your items you buy and i wish you could review your items separately instead of all at one time per order.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Why is there not a filter for plus? Even if you click Curve on the home page, the second you type something in the search bar it basically resets and shows xs-large. Then, if you try to filter by size, plus sizes are not even options. I don't understand this, do us heavier people not get the luxury of searching for specific styles besides the basic options you can click on? Like I just want some big girl cottagecore dresses without having to sift through 50 pages lol this is so frustrating"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"DON'T DOWNLOAD!! Can't trust the reviews that others leave about the items they purchase because they want to get points. The reviews are begging people to like them for points. Reviews are left before items even arrive. I noticed a huge increase in obvious spam and phishing emails when I had this downloaded. It was never flagged as malware but the spam stopped as soon as I deleted this app. If you must order from this Shein (or similar places) do so from their website, don't use apps."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love Shein clothes and prices. I have a addiction to ordering from this site, but lately it has grown slower because of the changes made to the Flash sales. Before it was 10 maximum but now it's 2. I was going to take a star away for the change I mention, but the prices still are great and the app runs smoothly."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Clothes always fit an arrive quickly Excellent service !
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Almost every single item I have bought has been on point with sizing or incredibly cute. I had like 1 or 2 that were a little big but no biggie about that still wearable and there were a couple things that weren't as cute as expected but still good enough to wear I've bought 100s of things from Shein it's all great I had rarely any issues, I haven't had to return anything I love the variety and materials and different colors and styles. I basically replaced my whole wardrobe!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Bad experience 😪. The handbags I had ordered appeared big on the phone but when they arrived they looked rather like toys or something out of a cartoon. One of the things I ordered were missing. I'm not satisfied with this service😭😭😭
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love the deals and has fast shipping
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It has been really great shopping with SHEIN! First time shopping online made me nervous about getting what i liked and the right size. i haven't been disappointed at all so far and they make it easy to find what I'm looking for. i like the points they use for daily check-ins, the videos for an inside look on some hot fashion and the amazing variety they have from men to women to kids. Also like the use of coupons they have for purchases. Overall I like it!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app because it's easy to use, it saves your place when you click on a new item so you can go back to where you were before , I love all the options available as well. The app is set up so that you can select kids, women's, men's, curvy, etc. so that you are always shopping the items you are interested in and it provides suggestions based on what you buy. The reviews are the best because the app gives you points for every review you leave making buying decisions easier."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've given 4 stars because, while I think the app is great, it's easy to use, quick delivery, returns process is straightforward I find that the sizes are not consistent, I'm usually a UK 16 and tend to look at the size chart before buying, when the item arrives its either too big or too small, don't get me wrong I've ordered plenty and think Shein is a great little app and will continue to use it, there's plenty of great choices in all areas of household, storage, garden, shoes, kids and more."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Speaking app wise, it works well. Speaking clothes wise, it's great actually. You pay little for all that you get, and yeah, it isn't the best quality, but what do you expect when you pay so little? The items are great for their price, the delivery doesn't only get delivered on time, but early too, earlier than the expected time. Would recommend shopping on Shein!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is easy to order, lots of different clothes and very reasonable prices. Delivery is either early or on time. Never late. Excellent service. Some of the products are very good quality amd some you get doesn't seem to last. As the saying goes you get what you pay for. Love thier dresses, blouses. I've ordered from shein for the past 2yrs."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The quality is ok. Although they said weekend is free shipping but it's not the case for me. Maybe it's the system or whatever
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Bought 10 items and I only sent back a few items. I love my new outfits and shipping only took 2 weeks. This was during the pandemic as well which was pretty impressive. Some items of clothing, that I sent back, were not good quality however, overall experience was a success."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Clothes are not as described n they will send you items you never ordered at all. Please there are other stores don't waste your time or your money. This place is a joke!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The rewards games look like a scam so no one wants to help and it would be nice to earns points otherwise besides inviting people for event things like the grab 5 give away.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! Every item I've ordered has been good quality, and have usually been delivered a little earlier than the prediction date, which is awesome. They make sure you always have coupons, and the points really help shaving off those prices too However, I suggest really paying attention to the measurements on clothes because their sizes are all over the place."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This app is a good one. At times the real products do defer from the photographs of the models. You need to understand and do a bit of research before placing an order. Recently I am facing an issue regarding delivery status. I have placed an order of over 2K on 7th of May and even to this day the status is awaiting package. Kindly update it the status so that I atleast know when it might arrive or is it even going to make it or not.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app is kinda fake I already invited new user but it still said they can't help I asked my go help so she made an account but it's Max assistant bruh I'm the only who knows her freaking code????????!!!!!!!😑😑😑😑😬😬💀💀💀😐😤😮‍💨
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been buying from Shein for a couple of years now. I love the clothes I've brought so far. I read the reviews from other shoppers to help me. Only reason I gave 4 stars was because the check in points, they do expire within a timeframe. It would be great if they didn't, it would help with end of year Christmas shopping, I know the prices are cheap already, but every cent or points counts 😊"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Ok ladies, WE know buying inexpensive clothes online can be a crapshoot experience. With apps like Wish or Zulily, (I've used both 😒) you may or may not get what is shown in the picture. Additionally, after one wash you may find the materials falling apart or the garment shrunk so much, it fits a child! So I was skeptical that Shein would be any different but I LOVE THEIR QUALITY FOR THE PRICE! I have bought over 130 pieces after losing 50 lbs and needed a new wardrobe! A+❤ I'm so happy!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great prices. That's my favorite thing about this shopping app. Everything I've ordered has been great quality. The amount of coupons are amazing and my orders have actually came earlier than planned which was amazing. Only thing is I wish there were more diverse sizes for petite women. A lot of the women's sizing is for slim hourglass shapes. The plus/curvy size option is nice but I'm talking about curvy petite. Otherwise, great app!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very good logistics and tracking services. The app is well built and packages arrive sooner than the apps estimation. I've been recommending this app to friends and family. I'd like to know how I can profit off of promoting SHEIN. Like what requirements should I meet etc. Overall, Good App, Great Prices that matches with the quality of the product. You definitely get what you pay for with SHEIN."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love this app and I have used it non stop!! I trust it very much and it doesn't take long for your items to come, compared to other websites. The sizing of the clothes on this website is brilliant, compared to other places and even smaller sizes can fit well too. You can get some really good offers and the products are really different, that you couldn't find in shops. I would recommend this website, not just for clothes, but for home decor as well."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A really useful and fun app for online shoppers! I think it's super fun, they always have what you are looking for. They are always on top of trends too! I also haven't had any trouble purchasing anything, and the clothing is good quality! Plus it is reasonable pricing on the clothing! Once again love this app and would recommend!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really nice popular and cute clothes. Great selection. Great prices. You really never know what material you will get and your best bet is to purchase items with great reviews and plenty of pictures. Also the best kindness you can do is review the items yourself, with pictures as well. Overall, very user friendly, but I imagine a annoying return prices, I probably would've returned 20% of my I'll fitting/never worn items had it been easier to."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Have had 3 orders with Shein, 2 delivered in quick time and one on its way. I found Shein to be very professional and their products are fantastic!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I LOVE SHEIN! ♡ I wasn't really into fashion-shopping before SheIn, because I am a plus-size - they make it easy, affordable, and really fun. I haven't been disappointed with any item I've purchased, out of the dozens I've bought. The size charts are useful. I could browse for hours in their jewelry and accessories. I love the crazy variety and being able to save multiple wishlists. There are plenty of sales & coupons. I really love the confidence boost SheIn gives me! Thank you! ❤️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Ordered 5 things. Three dresses were absolutely spot on. Just like the photos and great fit. One had definitely had the wrong size label put on it and I got sent a top instead of the shorts I'd ordered. But this was no problem. They were returned free and money refunded promptly. I've now found my 'go to' site for clothing. Thanks Shein 👍👏
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Great shipping process. However, I've decided not to shop with them again because the return process is absurd. One of my items was too little I requested return/refund and in a second it was refunded without a return label details. They claimed it is a gift to me not knowing it was a scammed. No way to communicate to them. I had to pay Klarna for an item that I have no use for after a month of delay waiting for their communication."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is not what I expected. I read the reviews, I see the ratings.. so I decided to give it a try with my first order being super small. I received my order and was able track it the entire time. So since my first order, I've ordered 8 more times and have received everything each time plus an added gift. So yes, I would recommend this app to friends with the added precaution of reading each review for each item and double check the sizes (be sure to measure yourself)."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I always have a pleasant experience shopping with Shein. Their delivery times are actually quite fast even if it's regular shipping and I returned a couple items from two orders worked out smoothly like butter. Ty. The only problem I've had with the app and the website is when I look for kids shoes it takes me somewhere else so that needs to be fixed.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really love the products that shein sell but unfortunately the shipping charges are too high. It's not always possible to buy a huge amount of goods at one go and that's when you have to face the shipping charges! Rs. 130 only for shipping is too high, 40 is still considerable. Otherwise I don't have a problem and I really really really do want to give it a 5 star but the shipping... Please do something about this. Maybe I'll rate it 5 star after using it enough 🙂"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I recommend it even though there are some negative aspects. But, first of all, the good things: 1. Cheap prices 2. Large sortiment 3. New trends But, sadly, there are bad things too. 1. Takes long to arrive (usually 6-8 days) 2. Questionable quality (Thin layers/cheap materials/broken easily etc) 3. It takes long to find the items you're maybe looking for because there are endless pages of items and stuff keeps repeating itself multiple times. Over all good when you have a lot of time!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The blouses are nice and true to size usually. Though emery rose cloth most of the time bleed when wash. T-shirt clothes are basically okay. Casual pants are ok, the blacks do not bleed and may be worn even without ironing. However, the checkered ones have different sizes. They are supposed to fit but they don't. They are bigger than the actual size. But vibrant colors remain, the clothing do not get old early. The styles are fabulous. But some blouses are made of non absorbent materials."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love Shein. I was hesitant to order at first because I wasn't sure of the quality or if you could send things back. In my experience the quality has been good. I always check reviews and look at customer photos before ordering but the prices and range of products are great. The return process is very straightforward and refunds are processed quickly. You have nothing to lose! The only thing I don't like is the processing fee applied to larger orders.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Lots of choice of modest dresses at a reasonable and even cheap price. The material is not top top quality on everything but you get what you pay for right? Customer service has been quick and friendly, orders usually come in a little early, things seem true to size. Four stars because some of the models are posed in clothes and in poses that are too sexy for me. Rather it would be more friendly. Also some reveiws are people saying they don't like the product but then it says 5 stars. Untrue."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"One of my go to shopping apps. Once you know which size is best for you it's easy. It's really helpful to have model measurements on item and also to read the reviews and see what sizes everyone else went for. Returns are easy and straightforward and although it can take a while for your purchase to arrive, you are kept informed. Have been and will continue to recommend"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein has good quality clothing for a cheap price which I love. all items bought arrive really quick and the packaging is always good quality. There's a huge range of items to buy, endless possibilities on shein honestly. you can earn points for doing different things on the app which reduce price on your purchases. I definitely recommend getting Shein it's the best app I have you won't regret it!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,There is no more free shipping in the afternoon on weekdays and weekends. You need to spend 249 pesos or more to get free shipping on your order. all the points can no longer be used. the usage will be limited
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app has allowed me to really explore my style and feel confident in what I wear. The cheap prices, deals/coupons, and time spent on shipping have not only kept me hooked, but have had me looking forward to something new every week. When I first heard of the app it was mostly known for clothes, but what alot of people don't know is that the app has home decor(bed,bath,etc), makeup, hair utensils, and skincare products. The app even has guest appearances from social influencers."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Customer support that I've gotten has been good even though it's a bot. Return policy is so quick and easy. Very affordable and trusting clothing app I love it so much but of course read the reviews about the clothes bc some are bad quality or runs small or runs large. The delivery usually comes a week early than the expected delivery which I love. And it's easy to get points and use them as money towards your cart. Clothing for women, Plus, men, pets, room decor, and beauty. So fun to browse!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have had a good experience with SHEIN mostly. The products are funky and varied. Some are a treat to wear, some aren't. My biggest concern is with the Shipping charges which are deducted amidst returning a product. No other site deducts amounts like that. So that's one big negative. Secondly, the SHEIN points get deducted almost everyday which is extremely unjust. Everyday we take time out to check-in only to find points deducted the next day. Please work on these suggestions. :)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, the delivery is conveniently fast, even considering the pandemic has slowed down deliveries for most online shops. The items I've bought so far have been of great quality, they are true to size, I've never received wrong items, damaged or wrong sized. Their customer service is very prompt amd helpful and they have plenty of deals and discounts. I'm a loyal customer and I can flaunt some pretty great outfits thanks to Shein."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They quality of the products is Very bad and services are also very poor! The products were not as good as shown in the pictures. The quality of the material is cheap. I tried returning the products, first of all they charge us for returning the products. And then some times the product cannot be returned because they do not have pickup service available in the mentioned address. I do not get it.. If they can deliver us the products then y can't they pick up the products from the same address!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,My experience has been 👍with Shein products. I'd say the products are as advertised. Sizes are accurate if you take into account the type of fabric ur product is made of. You may need to adjust ur size up or down to fit perfectly the way you want. Some materials are better than others but overall they are quality fabrics with few exceptions. Do ur research on what the one you choose is supposed to be like and also the % of it your product has that makes difference. Improvement? Delivery speed!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I only use Shopee and Shein. Based on my experience, the products are way cheaper in Shopee but they're not that generous with the points unlike Shein. With Shein, I can save a lot more! They have almost everything but they have limited items in some sub-categories. Overall, it's been a great experience. They also ship your orders right away. 😊"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Shein in my experience is just looking to make money. I had ordered clothes almost a month back and the tracking updates still show processing. The customer support is a big scam if you ask me . The chat bot seems to know about 10 answers that are repeated incessantly. When the customer service is contacted, It refuses to pick up the call and provide the reason for their inadequacy. Their are no refund options available. I feel stuck as no refunds are available. Please look into the matter."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This app is hit or miss. Sometimes clothes come really poorly made like they didn't even care when they was making them and sometimes you get really amazing piece's you can't believe the price was so good. At times the fabrics are weird and thin but other times they're soft and feel amazing. There's been many times I've had a cart ready to purchase but I cancel because I'm not willing to pay all the extra fees but they always have coupons and free shipping days you can wait for. Love/hate. 😁
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My order came in today and I speak to the shein bot and I want my new nails because what came in today is messed up and it literally came ruined there's no nails except for 2 single nails and the packaging is horrible I dont recomend it. A BIG SCAM THEY KEEP IGNORING THE ISSUE.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shein is a great place for online shopping. The stuff is also good and I am able to afford it, but there is a bug with the online website on my phone causing it to lag. Not only that but when I was about to buy something on my tablet for $50 off of the website I didn't have a credit card set up on there and it wasn't acting correctly, so I got on my phone and added up the same things I had in my cart on the tablet and it was almost $20 more. Besides that, Shein is great app for online shopping."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have perchased lots of things off of shein and nothing too bad to say. Most of the things are pretty good quality. It has great, cheap prices and nearly everything your looking for. The only other thing I would say is that if you buy something white it will almost always end up being see through. Other than that really great store and I will definitely continue to order things from there."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Scam app.. promo games. Just want to lure downloads.. when referred someone then shutdown the game .. don't use this scam app
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"promotion games are rigged and fake. no one actually wins anything. the reviews are fake, the ""oh you are in the 1% who got this deal"" fake. I invited friends that didnt have the app ever before and their accounts were shut down when using the invite link."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love that their quality is getting better and better each time I shop here. There are a few site /app features they need to update with filters and sorting i.e. when you select an item if you go to the description page and try to pick up where you left off it goes all the way back to the top of the list instead of staying at the last item selected. That's the biggest issue I can complain about other than that I love this site and can't wait to see how they evolve. Great home decor items too! ♥
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love Shein! My order arrived days early and the packaging was great. The ordering process was quick and efficient. I had one issue but chatted with them through the app and the issue was immediately resolved. Such a great selection of outfits and the prices fit within my very limited budget. Highly recommend!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've placed a few orders and as long as you pay attention to the measurements and look for photos in the reviews of they're there, most stuff is good. Unless it's swimwear or lingerie most stuff is returnable if you're not happy with it. Just pay close attention to what you're ordering and read all of the details. Which anymore you need to do with any online shopping."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Deserve minus or zero stars Third class app cloths quality is not good. app is not user friendly, service is very cheap very difficult to connect customer care number and if connected then agent don't know anything return policy is very bad, we have to self return n if they pick up which they don't do. for delivery (address it is ok) for pickup (no pickup available for this address) n for that they charge for it. waste of money n time (app) , very disappointing. :("
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this shop! I've bought so many clothes from them this year and it's been a hit. I only had sizing issues with 3 pieces. They refunded me and let me keep the items the last time I had this issue. I was able to give it away to someone who fit it. Otherwise, everything fits great! You need to take your measurements. You can't go by the size you think you are, because the fits vary. They can other run big or small. You need to click on each size, check the measurements and order from there."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Well it's an absolutely amazing app to shop from but my reason to give it 2 stars was the time taken to deliver the items. I ordered my stuff almost 1 week ago and it's still not here. And also tracking details have not been updated since 2 days. An additional point is that, while giving the order you can't really analyse when your order will be reaching to the address. This needs to be fixed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app automatically pastes the clipboard every single time I open it. Incredibly creepy. That could be a password, a phone number, whatever the last thing you copied gets sent to them EVERY SINGLE TIME you open the app. Frankly I'm surprised that's not enough to get them kicked off or suspended from the play store."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great place to shop for trendy or even basic items definitely items that are not sophisticated or mature; it really is geared towards Young fun, sexy clothing. the shipping time is really decent. Even the shoes are pretty decent quality and good enough to wear confidently. And this app is so addicting in a good way. I've had a really good experience so far with this app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,🥰This is the best app ever I swear! The app has a creative fun way to earn points and the points convert into $ to use on your next purchase and everything is already really low priced and great quality it has DIY tutorials and keeps up with great fashion! The create outfit contest is my favorite part because it's super addictive and allows to show off your inner fashion and gives friendly competition and all positive vibes! I usually don't rate apps but this one was one is appreciated 👍👍👍
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love this app. I can view items, order them, pay for them and track the delivery. I can check in each day and collect points which give me money off of my orders. I can leave reviews about any item I've purchased which gives me further points and even more savings. The best thing of all is, I can fill my basket as much as I want and it never gets emptied until I pay for my stuff. Their clothes are amazing and they stock for a wide range of sizes. Thank you SHEIN you're amazing."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It was ok apart from the fact it takes ages to get here. Randomly today i was creating a board and adding things I had added my items it had taken my 20 minutes... and it re started the app. I was confused and it annoyed me a bit then I tried again 20 minutes later it does the same thing... this is really getting on my nerves I just want to add items to the board without it re starting the app every time I get past 30 items (you can put 100 items on a board) please fix otherwise great app 🤗
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Love this app has alot of great stuff for affordable prices, but one thing would be nice to have it can tell u items u brought already, esp if it's been returned and the reason for it. I'm always looking for jeans and i get so confused on which ones ive brought and why i returned it if done so. Another issue is customer service. Sometimes getting in contact with a live agent can be so hard and frustrating it's ridiculous, and ticket submission takes too long when u want something done quickly."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Easy to use app...fast delivery on items too...love the daily check in for points that convert to Shein money 👌🏼 the clothes are the right fit if you select the right size for your measurements! Quality is fairly decent for the price and the price is pretty fabulous...the higher value items I have bought have been worth the price! And the smaller value items have exceeded my expectations! You will have the odd disappointment but that's expected of online shopping! Discounts are great!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The free games are all copied off of temu,and when you are close to winning them it says ""your game has been suspended for unusual account activity"" so you can't win the games and it's just a big ripoff. Temu is way better sorry 😬"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A great inexpensive online site to purchase quality items. I was introduced to Shein by my daughter, and since then I have being a consistent happy customer for 2 months now. I was wondering where was Shein all along? They have a very wide range of items to choose from. They always deliver on time with some of the items well packaged. The return process is pretty smooth. I would hope though that certain handbags and hats are better packaged, and that the wigs will have a better smell."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great app great clothes & always delivered earlier than expected *****
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app! It always worries me to order off line because you never know what youre getting.. Especially with the low priced items! But this app is lovely! Ive ordered from them multiple times and I love every item i recieve.. And a bonus is it doesnt take long for them to fill the order and ship it out. Longest it took to get my stuff was 2 weeks!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,For the most part a good shopping experience. I would really like to see more items last longer The items seem to sell out so fast. Also a better customer service helpline as for example when a customer doesn't qualify for your pay later service if there was someone to explain it would be alot more beneficial to take measures to correct the problem.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Every time I try to log in I am sent a verification code. All I want to do is log in with my password (which half the time they tell me is wrong!) Advised of faulty items but was completely ignored. No accessible customer service. Website very ""bitty"", always have to go back and start again. Have deleted the app. Too much trouble."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is overall good however the promotional games don't work. Especially the 100€ balance game which doesn't let me or my friends get the last 100 points for it to spin and actually give us the ability to have our last spin and claim the big prize. I am very disappointed by this and I want help so I can be compensated after following all the rules of the game, until the very end."

I definitely recommend this app, it's great! 💗💕"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I had both two clothes so far one in very good for$15 price but the other not so good for$35 (the material was not as good as it shows in the pic) All and all I like shein because they have very good style of clothes. The only problem I have is that the material I might get is not consistent. One might think that clothes that cost a lot (at least over $20) should have an expectation of being of good quality materials.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoy shopping on Shein. I find a lot of styles I would definitely wear, from shoes to clothes and bags. But like any other online shopping, you take a chance with quality and sizes. The great thing about Shein is being able to track your order. If something is wrong with the order, customer service is available to assist and that alone makes Shein my number one place to shop."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I really like Shein they have a great selection of items.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I checked out my baskethad all our summer clothes in to get the 25% discount which I thought was great. But when I looked through email confirmation items were missing. I found 5 items still in my basket meaning I couldn't get discount on them as they were under the amount. Tried contacting support and kept saying server error. Why would it not checkout all items??
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Excellent!! I love this app. I buy clothes 4 everyone in my family. I don't recommend the clothes from the flash sales though. Lot of the clothes look great on the girls wearing them. When I put them on it was a whole different story. I try 2 stay way since there is no returns allowed. It ends up being a waste of money. I just get ride of the stuff I don't look good in. Shipping takes to long I'm just to impatient. 🙄 somethings I wish they changed bit over all good new affordable clothes.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love shopping on this app, but they never give you an accurate price description for literally anything. I just want to see the truth, please stop giving me inaccurate prices once I go to order. You know, I used to get really excited to buy something for 28$ and just seeing it go up to 43$ really sucks. Please don't use this app, all the coupons you receive are fake, and most of them never work. More than half of the clothes I bought were so poorly made I had to throw them out."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,BEST SHOPPING SPREE I EVER HAD WAS ON SHEIN! GOT EVERYTHING I ORDERED IN EXCELLENT CONDITION AND IT CAME IN A WEEK!!! DEFINITELY PLANNING ON BUYING AGAIN ❤️👏🏼👌🏼THANK YOU SHEIN!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Clothing is very affordable and shein has some amazing clothes. In particular I'm a huge fan of you're jeans and the quality is quite good for the price. Some items however are very cheaply made and look very cheap. I guess its what we get for the price we pay but my issue is, stop advertising models wearing an item and then it looks totally different in person otherwise everything else is great, shipping is fast, great return procedure."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"it did not let me return item, it has been more than 15 days, and i don't want this kind of tela"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love shein. Prior to this, I would never shop for clothes online. Because of the way I'm shaped (wide back), I always have to try on new clothes. Now, with Shein, not only do I have access to thousands of different choices, but returns are seamless. Shein pays for the first pckg of returns of each order. I am so happy with the beautiful selections of clothes for Women, kids and the best part yet is the affordable prices. You can look like a million bucks for just a few bucks."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Everything I got from SheIn the quality of the clothes is amazing and it all looks like pictures and feel comfortable pay attention to pictures reviews and sizes and product details i love high stretch and soft it depends on the day.

And it's true everything is better quality for cheaper price i make an order at least 2x a month. Use ur exact measurements. Worth it"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Greate app, has a variety of clothes and sizes, ranging from, "" petite "" to "" plus size and curves "". A very good feature to accommodate all body types. But a warning, when buying a product check your measurements first then order, coz some clothes have smaller bust cut, or wider waist, and thers nothing worse than getting the wrong size,coz return costs are expensive and you have to wait another century to recieve the clothes.my only problem is the long delivery time,other than my exp was good"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Worst app for shopping and even worst is their customer service. I have called them multiple times for the delay in my order but to all in vain they didn't answer the call but auto disconnects the call arround 7 minutes of waiting. The live chat is so frustrating that it keeps on repeating the same question again and again. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS APP
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love this place. I thought it was going to be cheap quality but so far everything that has been sent is exactly the same as the photo & the sizes are mostly accurate too.

I get my packages in 1 week the most. I love that it displays what size the model dresses in and you have lots of authentic reviews to judge your sizing which makes it easier to get your correct sizing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love the plus size selection. Though they should add more of the most popular outfits to include plus sizes. *Update 01/04/2021* Though I love the selection on Shein and how quickly my items arrive, I find it petty that they have you check in daily to earn points that they quickly take away. Building up your points for days or weeks just to have 100-200 or more of those points taken off just sucks. Definitely thinking of not participating in their points system. It just isn't worth the time."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"During black friday sale I placed a very big order for holidays and system was extremely glitchy, guessing it was very busy. Somehow it proceeded a faster shipping, even though I clicked standard, and a week later I was billed quite a hefty fee for customs. I got in touch with customer service and they covered half the bill. I found this so incredibly understanding of them, they could have just as easily decided I was just not paying attention and clicked the wrong thing. Very nice, thanks shein"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"New to on line shopping and Shein are good. Size is generally accurate, deliveries before due date, easy to shop and no issues. Selection/range is vast. I do get lost on the app but I'm not tech savvy, May be suggest similar items to poss match what's ordered previously to build up a new wardrobe when logging on. I do appreciate the site and recommend to friends. One thing I would like is possibly to order a few items at once but have the option to deliver certain to different addresses. Tks"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love SheIn because they have a large selection of stylish clothes, shoes, and all types of other trendy products. These products hold up pretty well and most of all their products are not expensive at all. The only problem I have about SheIn is the shipping. It takes about 2 weeks for you to get an order. Then you have to pay to ship back. This is ridiculous and extremely too long. If Amazon can do it in 2 days then there is a way. If they can fix this issue, it will change the game for them."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Shein is great so far I'm new to the whole thing but my experience has been great so far. Delivery is a little slow due to covid but that's understandable. The reason this isn't a five star is because the for me personally finding the right size for me is difficult because some items have different sizing but overall great app and great clothes that look expensive but are cheap and good quality materials. Plenty of deals and a great site if your looking to build up your wardrobe.

Shipping can be slow but I've never had any issues with what I've received vs what I ordered.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A very excellent shopping app, fast delivery and good quality products which is why I'm giving it 4stars. The other star is for the address book part. Im from South Africa and there are some areas that do not appear on the list as it says ""Temporarily cannot deliver to this zip code"", whereas areas around that area are on the list. Please update more areas on the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,A great app.i recommend that when looking always click on reviews as having other people feedback on items and photos of other customers wearing item that you are interested in is great. You can really see how the garment looks on different body shape.which really helps you to see if it will look good on you.and the points you can earn by using app can be used as money of purchase is a really great idea. Every thing i have brought from shen I have loved. The price are great too.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Shein is SUPER cute and SUPER affordable! My biggest issue is that they have a ""curvy"" section but their clothes are not flattering on me. Every item I have received looks like a shower curtain on me. I'm a large and about 160 pounds. The material of the clothes is rather odd as well. I'd definitely say ""You get what you paid for"". Cheap price, cheap material, doesn't look flattering unless you have a built/fit body."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love SHEIN, they have the the most amazing styles and so many there is something for just about anybody and any style I love all of them, the make up and nail design accessories are awesome to and the selection is never-ending. Plus the nail tech tools are of decent enough quality especially for the price. Which did I mention that the prices are absolutely amazing.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pretty good app for shopping, would reccomend, but some things may arrive damaged, but almost never so dont worry, its literally only if you have a mailman who hates you <3"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"App is just as easy to use as the website. Saves items in cart, wishlists, etc between web and app seemlessly so you can switch from one to the other easily depending on the device your using. And lets not forget the great products and amazing prices. The detailed order tracking info is also very helpful."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Until I learned about the cruelty within the fast fashion industry, this app was a guilty pleasure. However, that being said, so many things went wrong. The clothing was cute on the models, but the quality and sizing was oftentimes way way off even with the proper sizing chart. Decor was a hit or miss. Most of the products I ordered ended up either smelling really bad, smaller than pictured or uncomfortable to wear. Also, Shein and its competitors tend to steal designs and I'm not for that."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent All-Round Super-Saving Shopping Experience!! I highly recommend SHEIN! 👌 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 SHEIN have every category covered, whether it be home comforts & hygiene to DIY, casual clothing to bridal wear for all ages, shapes & sizes, including an enormous range of footwear for all occasions, plus a range of items for skin care & personal hygiene to stunning makeup & accessories! 😃 Go check it out now! They also have reasonable delivery frames & a clear returns/exchange policy."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is overall good but it can make a change in the shoes section as the pictures are not appropriate enough to judge whether the shoe is good or not. In some they have shown the shoes from all the sides properly but in others not much, which leads to trust issues . I think they can come up with the shoe 360° view update."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Purchased my first order, and couldn't have been more happy with the quality and price I paid for my clothes. Fits perfectly as shown in pics! 1XL is more a size 16 (which is my size, but was wanting bigger) in shein curve. When purchasing larger tops or jumpers be weary of sizing. Got to me in timely manner, cos it was a large order. But was super happy with my purchases!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Won't let me use visa gift cards, I've updated my app and made sure none of my cards are expired and all have the correct balance but the app isn't letting me pay🧐"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Delivery takes time. I only used them once but I was able to check in on the tracking regularly, the tracking updated regularly-every couple of days, made up for the wait. Items arrived packaged well. Quality of the clothing I got either matched the expectation of the price I paid or surpassed it. The key with the site is to measure yourself and note the measurements on each item as they all differ. Have made my second order. The discounts are great, the points are a great perk easy to use."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was pleasantly surprised with their site. Descriptions of the items, for the most part, accurate. Shipping was quick. I liked their, it was thorough. Really, the only thing I would like to see is an increase in bandwidth for their site. It does get boggy. All orders have been delivered on, or before the estimated delivery date."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's the best so far however whenever I lose something I'll never find it but it's still the best hope it keep it up
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Shein app is very easy to use. Easy to navigate. Can come back and see the browsing history. It allows users to look for the similar type of products if anything is sold out or out of stock. The discount coupons and extra points for reviews are great. But it would be better if the reviews are being checked for authenticity and then get posted on the website. Ads are of course annoying and would be better off if there are no ads. Most of the products I purchased are exactly as shown in the pics.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I saved a lot of points just to buy the clothes that i want, and then YOU updated this and now I can only use 30% of the discount."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Shein is a pretty good site. They have so many different varieties and sizes for all ages . The clothing usually always come on time . The sizing is off a lot tho. My normal size is medium and sometimes it comes two times too big or two times to small. It's a gamble for sure 😂 they have lots of options for you to save money. Also live events where you can earn points and win gifts. I don't like that they take away your points after a certain time tho. I save points just to have them vanish
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is horrible and not user friendly at all. They have a lot of fake reviews as well. And you won't be able to get any help if you have an issue with your order. They have no live agents to assist and the method of shipping they offer is horrible. Still missing an item and not worth trying to talk to their robots about it. The clothing runs extremely small and most of the material is cheap, falling apart, or very itchy. I will never order from this app again. So not worth the headache!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Does'nt like the new update of this app. Bring back the old features.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"What I like about shein that their dresses, shirts, shoes, anything that can be a fashion is very unique, beautiful, and most importantly is that it has a nice fabric when you wore it or touch it. And I will never complain about their high prices because it is very worth it. So that's the reason why you need to download shein now and go shop now!!!!...💗💗💗"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The clothes on here are actually really great quality for the price. Some of the clothing items are a little cheaper than they look in the pics on the app but all you have to do to make sure they look as advertised is look at the reviews for the item right below and people post their own pics of it so you can tell if it's the same quality as advertised. Many ways to save money too with them constantly giving you coupons and many easy ways to earn points that save you money. Overall a great app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent. I was hesitant at first, however have been ordering from them for months. Items are true to size, shipping is reasonable - usually 2 weeks or less. Customer service is great. I order my active wear from them. Cute, fashionable, lots of discounts, friendly, great service. As long as it stays that way I'm a loyal customer."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I LOVE Shein! Most of the clothes I've received are amazing. Sometimes I'm left amazed at how nice an item is for the low price I paid. Some items run weird in fit or size, or fabric, so it's important to read comments. I love being able to see pictures of individuals with normal bodies wearing the clothing. Free returns is also very important to me!! Shein is amazing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really love shopping at SHEIN because it has cheap and low prices, and have really good crop tops, pants and shorts, accessories, sets, and more! But what is really weird is that I am buying a set of sweatpants and a top sweatshirt that cost $27 but it went down to 19$ sale. Yeah, so what's the problem? When I go check-out it is now 24$. I didn't add anything or change anything on cart. I need help, is this how the price is suppose to be or what! But anyways, so weird."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's mostly easy to navigate, but has a tendency to put things in categories that don't belong there, like having men's clothing mixed in with the women's, which can be annoying. And if I put it for example price high to low or vice versa, they'll also have certain things out of place there at times also, but other than that I like the app. The prices makes getting clothes from there so worth it, and my wardrobe is much classier since I started using it, which I love. Worth downloading to me."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"UPDATED - COMPANY ARE CON MEN, TODAY THEY STARTED OFFERING FREE CHRISTMAS DELIVERY KNOWING THEY HAVE DELAYS WHICH WILL STOP ANY DELIVERY ARRIVING BEFORE CHRISTMAS. AVOID SHEIN. Do not order from Shein... They have 20 day delays so no chance of getting items before Christmas, the customer service is also terrible. Avoid this app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Shane is really one of the best apps in the world that is my opinion so you can buy clothes you can buy like toys you can buy room decor you can buy makeup you can buy Lily almost anything it's amazing I really think y'all should buy it cuz I love it and it's just thank you for listening to this and I really think you should buy this app
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love the prices!! I've only shopped for scrapbooking & junk journal supplies. You've got to be SUPER CAREFUL when your buying!!! Certain things are completely misrepresented!!!! Most of the time I'm happy with my order other times I'm so mad and feel cheated. It's a gamble, once you know what you want and how to navigate the website it's pretty fun!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The best clothing brand app ever. I love how the measurements preview when you select a particular size, so the customer doesn't have to look at the size chart from time to time. And the app also suggests similar designs below in case the chosen item is low in stock or sold out. It's like being assisted by a helpful and nice store crew virtually and it's so beautiful. The app shows images of the clothes fast, as well."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"App works really well, the filters are great to find what you need. The quality of items I've bought have been great, I've ordered more than I should have really. Tracking is brilliant and very reliable, which is more than can be said for other over seas purchases. I have needed to use the chat function to ask about an order, connection time was really quick and the person I spoke to was really helpful and polite. Will definitely continue to use them."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I think using the Shein app is great! I have placed 13 orders I'm about 3-4 months. I can't get enough of the app. It's so easy to use and the Shein points add up so quickly and you can use the points to get more Shein products. They sell women's,men's""maternity baby, boys, and girls. Plus they have nails makeup electronic items and head phones on top of that they have mini games and things you can do to earn points which equals $$$$$ for items purchases..I am absolutely a Shein fan!!!!"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Haven't made a purchase yet but so far seen some great deals and tons on promotions such as clothes for all ages and genders, home decor, etc. The app is pretty easy to navigate as well. The prices are definitely affordable even without promotions. Will be making a purchase in the next day or two and will update if I have any problems but so far 5 stars from me 😁"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The clothes is very good and the price is excellent . But the delivery service is not that good it came 2 weeks later .
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It very easy to navigate the initial coupons are extremely useful the high quality clothes are really cheap and there is a variety to chose from this app has clothes shoes(sry but don't look good) jewelry, watches, hats, it even has electronics. This is a good app for heavy shoppers(meaning you shop for clothes a lot) because all of the stuff is low priced. But the cheaper items are extremely low quality and the material is not very good. So expect low quality if you're buying from shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"AMAZING!!! the prices are affordable and since being on shein their delivery services have gotten so much better and quicker. Never had any issues. Easy to make an exchange or return. Everything done in the app. Once I learned the sizes I am able to get pretty much anything I need. Being genderfluid, it's nice to be able to buy easily between the men and women section."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I've ordered many times now and they never leave met disappointed. The app is really easy to use and makes buying clothes so much fun.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great overall experience. App interface is very user friendly. Quick, easy and secure payment process. Delivered more than a week before earliest estimated delivery date. Bought a variety of different products (30 to be exact) with only 1 that was a bit defective. Very happy customer"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app looks like it has some good clothing, it's just unfortunate it's not letting me order any. Whenever I add things to my basket, proceed to check out and fill in all my information, I get stuck there. It keeps loading over and over, but never actually processes my order or payment. It's very frustrating and I haven't been able to buy a single item of clothing yet."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Amazing place to buy clothes or items for your room!! The prices are really high but it worths it. Unfortunately because of the prices I can't get a lot of things because with 4 items I paid 48.67 dollars...But again it's a great application to buy things! My only problem is the shipping...It's not their fault but they should have predicted it...Acs is really slow the past 2 years and they treat our packages garbage!!! I was ready to take money back but thanks god for hearing my prayers!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is an amazing app. Amazing. I love that it sells toys, shirts, pants, shoes, makeup and more.But.One thing I really dislike about SHEIN is that the dilevery time is too long. Way to long. Another thing that is not my favorite is that some of the bathing suits I got are ripping off the thread. I think that this app is still an amazing app experience for me and I hope this encourages you to go and treat yourself to some new cheap and amazing items."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I would've them 5 stars if they had free shipping more often on every purchase especially the 2 and 3pcs outfits, they should have better discounts than what they offer too especially during the holidays. I finally purchased one of my 2pcs outfits 2 days ago but it took me months if not longer for me to purchase it and that's only because I joined the Shein Club. If I didn't it would still be unpurchased. Long story short. Give better discounts and have them more often."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Clothing is hit or miss but surprisingly better quality than expected for the price. The jewelry is cheap and quality is reflected, but the home goods are a home run! It's super fun shopping and if you do get a sweater that's not quite like the picture, there's good chance you're still gonna like it and wear it any way!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Orders normally arrive almost a week before the delivery date, which is even better, app is very user friendly. A variety of items I even like that they have categories is order to find whatever you looking for much quicker. Sizes are true to size, they qualify is good,some of the more expensive items materials are great. I definitely order atleast once every second month"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Been waiting for my package for over a month now, the tracking info say its 14 days maximum... when I try and report the delay am met with ""the product is not eligible button"" ... if I were you I'd stick to Temu and Amazon, don't waste your time here, this people don't care !!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Edit: I still ordered more and I still have No problems. Besides me misreading detail .. Everything I have ever gotten from this site was on point, and sometimes better quality than the price, but I'm not complaining. The only problems were one loose button fell off a pair of shorts because I was rough with it wearing it that day, but it's an easy fix! Also I misread the tapestry measurements as inches! Never had a problem with shipping as well. I'll always shop here."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So far I have a pleasant experience with the app. They deliver timeously and keep you updated, I have not had a missing item or wrong size. What I would appreciate is a better explanation of the material used for the clothes. Some give a winter vibe from how they are presented but are actually light and not suitable for cold weather."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love the app. Love the clothes. I get compliments all the time on my style and outfits. I just wish they had size xs more often as an option. Seems their sizes run a little big. I'm 5'3 and around 115-120lbs and sometimes the size small tops feel like I'm swimming in them. Wish the lengths of their short dresses were a tad bit longer but otherwise good quality for great price and excellent customer service! App is great!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely beautiful clothes just having quite a bit of an issue on sizing it seems a lot of people having that problem. Also, several other online stores sell the same products and some are cheaper some are more expensive but it's hard to tell which is a better brand or which is a better piece of material. It's hard to feel safe paying for things when you see the same items several other places and they're not nearly as nice as they look in the picture compared to what the customer provides"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing so far😊😁! I would definetly recommend now even more! *adding to the rating. I love all the great finds and sales and the points and coupons which are great ways to save even more, but the only thing I don't like is that they changed the amount of items you can get at a time from the flash sales or that they never have any shoes on sale but other than that still one of my favorite apps for buying nice quality clothes and various other things for the house and things like that."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I do no support business wh woul put transgender thing on their advertisement. That is unseemly and awful. Panties with a mail print? Thats very very offensive..

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love everything about shein! I've never had an issue! Shipping sometimes can take longer than I'd like but it's not the end of the world you just gotta be prepared to wait sometimes. But the clothes are always amazing and are almost always true to size. Great quality and perfect prices for a single mama on a budget. I buy for myself and all of my kids. I always recommend! Make sure you read reviews on items!!! They're usually on point!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"At first, prices were very good, after a while when everyone from my country started to use this app the prices went higher and higher!! It became more expinsive than the prices in my country itself! Also if you switch to another country in the app, you will find that the prices is cheaper there. Recently they prevented to order from another countries and they expect us to pay more just because we live in a specific place. Not ordering from this app anymore."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The worst IVR possible for contacting the customer service. Have to press buttons every 30 secs even to stay waiting for the executives. If the wait exceeds 7 mins which is the case most of the time the call gets dropped. Called from different no of different service providers to check if that is because of network issue and found that it is a problem in Shein's system
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My problem happened maybe almost two years ago. I do not believe there was an app. I like a lot of your products but the one time I ordered 6 items, every single one of them were to small, bad fitting, or cheaply made. When you order a x large and you get a small, well it was rediculous. Then when I tried to get ntouch with someone, well that was a joke. I ended up giving it all to Goodwill and unfortunately am afraid to order anything form you. I lost over $300.00. Thanks but no thanks"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I know that alot of people had problems with shein but I've ordered from the site 5 times, from 5 different houses in 2 different countries since 2018 and I've never had problems. I've paid with both cash as well as card and never had delays with each. Refunds happen in a span of less than 2 hours, no complains at all. A nice feature would be to check-in points as soon as you open the app"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great quality and stylish products for affordable prices. Some items can be less than perfect though and the sizes can vary quite a lot so must always be careful with that. However, overall you get what you paid for or better. The app itself is also pretty smooth running, has a user friendly layout and so far I haven't suffered any glitches."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is awesome so far. There are many pieces that are super cute and very affordable. I have ordered my first package now and I am looking forward to ordering a whole lot of tone more! You should totally get the app and trust me, you'll never feel the urge to go shopping any more in a long lasting and exhausting shopping trip. Instead, you'll just be like chilling on the couch while becoming fashionable."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is a really good app for shopping stylish clothes. I have been shopping on here for about two years now and have not had a problem. There are no adds. Pretty much every package comes between one to two weeks after purchase. Some of the clothes are thinner material but you get what you pay for. I love my clothes from here and wear then almost everyday. I would just request when sizing do one size bigger on anything you are shopping for but not with things that are meant to be over sized. ❤️
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really good prices and decent quality, the only thing I find annoying is the vouchers which usually only last for a few days after they're given to try and pressure you into buying but it's not enough time to consider what I want so I rarely get to use them. The review feature is amazing especially since it can be difficult if you're larger chested to guess whether something will fit you. Seeing other people's pics of the outfits are really helpful."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have an account already... But it keeps asking me to log in (although I don't log out) . Recently, the same thing happened and I was only able to log in -- under a different user name (while the registered email address was the same) and now, as a result, I've lost about 600 something points from the previous account that I was planning to use up for purchase after the lockdown is over."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, its good quality items for cheap (not Wish prices cheap but still good). The only thing I dont like is not being able to choose the color some of the items come in. It'll choose a random color for you and if you order mulitple of that same item, they all come in the same color. Not bad but when I order 3 notebooks from the same listing, I'd rather not get all the same color notebook out of 5 the ""random colors"". Also most items, non-clothing related, are mini, not full size"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've always had great experience with this app. I get my clothes within a timely manner usually a week and a half 2 weeks I believe I've noticed that I always get my packages like 4 or 5 days before my expected delivery date. The clothes are great too I've had clothes from shein longer then my high end clothes. The app for me has never froze or gone wrong I personally have never had an issue with this app!! Clothes sometimes run true to size other times I have to size up or down depending on fit
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I haven't gotten a bad quality item yet! Or even an item that was an inaccurate description. Just be super aware of the measurements on your order as I fluctuate between their xs-m depending on the item. Discounts are always wicked. The app itself runs very smooth.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love to see all the great options Shein has to offer, in all areas of my life. Everything I have bought has actually fit me, even to the shoes. I love them and they're great fit. I have also been able to track my orders. From the time that it ships out I'm able to track it and see where my shipment is at all times. I do Love the convenience of that."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,so I know people are basing the service of the store as a entirety then the app itself. so based of my experience using the App it works smoothly I like how you can play minigames to earn coupons and such. reviewing your received items is also super easy and it allows you to to pictures of the items from your phone which earns you double points. the app also allows you to do daily check-ins for free points which is also a plus. so as a app I like it. 💖💖.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"""Only shein store items can be shipped to your area, please remove items from other stores? I will not pay anymore the shein club if I can't buy what I want from the app. I didn't have this problem before."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is like the best app ever cos you get really cheap but very cool stuff within almost just a week. Hands down this is the best shopping app ever. I'd recommend it to all. The products are almost all the time just like how it's described or shown the picture. It's really great. Go for it guys. Try mainly the accessories and Home products section.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,just bought once... a dress but these guys played a smart move. it seems they don't have the item in stock so they sent a wrong item instead. and when i asked for return and exchange they used the covid card and said it is not possible for taking return and you have to self return to the address. i didn't understand if they don't have the item in first case y did they accept it and they sent me a complete different item. so now i have to pay extra for the courier to send them back. falthu app

For the thing that didnt fit, they made it super easy to return things. Edited: ordered my second purchase a month ago and heard nothing from them, there is no way of contacting them or finding out what is going on or where it is."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Have made a couple orders , great return policy super easy to return & love the option to have a wallet for return purchases , super fast service to ship & delivery was even earlier then expected!!! Love the wide varied of evething theybhave from clothes to shoes ,accessories & other products!! Clothes are of good quality & sizes are pretty dead on . I have a odd body shape and everything has been pretty good . Just purchased another basket full , I'm sure I will have more in coming months"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shein is a low cost store which is magnificent, they stock a wide range of items which includes clothing, bags, shoes etc for the entire family which is fabulous, everything is under one roof. Their professionalism is second to none, highly RECOMMENDED. The one thing that needs improvement is the time in which it takes to get your order, I have to order 3 weeks in advance. Please do something about that."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Loveeee Shein! I've so far order 4 seperate times. Some clothes, decorations, bed set, and jewelry, and each time everything I got was perfect! The descriptions are spot on, and so is the estimated delivery (around 2-3weeks which isn't bad coming from another country) I did have one item missing with a delivery but shein's online rep was super quick and helpful in putting in a new order and sending it my way. 10/10 so far from me, I'll keep ordering and update this with any future updates!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Perfect shopping experience! My items always show up in time and always receive coupons. Shein has more than clothing including pillow cases, shower heads and LED lights. Whether I wanna get things for my home or my closet, I go here instantly. The PRICES are perfect too! I can easily get a sexy top for 7 dollars. Almost everything feels nice and never feels cheap."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love this app! The prices are affordable & high end materials for the most part ! I love how it also provides you with the alternate payment methods, it's user friendly for people that are on a strict budget too but like to keep up with the trends as well with Afterpay, Khlarna, PayPal, Google Pay, ect.. The app is also very user friendly, I've personally experienced little to no issues using it on my android, friends! Highly recommended :)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I think the app is good in general. But I don't like that an app for a store has mandatory ads for itself when you open it. I am already here to spend money! Also, my friends and I order together, but when I share my board with the friend that does the ordering, my sizes don't transfer. I always have to go over every item, and that is annoying."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"With the latest update, the check in points became lame. Small points everyday. The older one is better."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ordered several items and was moderately satisfied. The items are of course cheaply made, you get what you pay for. A LOT of the designs are stolen from independent artists, and that's the main reason I uninstalled this app. I would rather pay more money and get a better quality item as well as support the real artists who designs are repeatedly stolen by SHEIN."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The problem is, the high quality clothes or the high quality items are really really expensive. But when you find an item that is so good, and a little bit cheap, then, I advice you, to RE look at it. Because some people buy the item, they post pics of the item, and when you see it in real life, you won't like it as much as you thought, because it is obviously diffrent, in a bad way. So please, if this site is about introducing cheap things in a wonderful way, then I don't need to waste my money"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"At first impression, I am totally pleased with the choice of only 3 colors used in the app homepage which makes the app look clean. I loved my user experience, the product searching was a smooth experience and the browsing is in a way, neater than other shopping apps, even when the content can be endless. The page loads were speedy too. As per the shopping part, I appreciate the easily available features to find plus size clothing. Good app design & experience overall ✨"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good experience so far. I've ordered once but it was for 10 items. 9 out of 10 fit perfectly and were good quality for the price. Very well thought through app and customer interaction with live streaming video fashion shows, picture galleries of outfit ideas as well as customer reviews and photos of people wearing the clothes they bought."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Love that customers can post photos of themselves in the clothes. Very unique and extremely helpful to see your body type in the outfit as well as models. Loads of styles to choose from. Great deals. Would love an outfit generator with body type in mind for people with no idea now to put an outfit together with shoes and accessories ect like me lol
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Very bad. We cannot exchange some products or return them. What kind of option is this? Being an online service they should always have an option for exchange if not return. How pathetic. Worse experience ever. Now they have my money and the dress doesn't even fit. What a waste of time. Don't ever buy clothes from this site as if u cannot fit you will not be able to return. It is applicable on a few items only. And quality is also not that great anyway.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Beware of over charging. I have a screenshot of my purchase and the price etc. They over charged me and wouldn't make it right. I used to love shein. Now I will never use them again.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Having never heard of this website I was curious when it popped up on my Facebook feed. I really liked the look of several of the pieces but was dubious as I had never used before. Still, because I fancied a treat i selected a few very reasonably priced pieces. The delivery time stated 7 days an it came early which was nice. All pieces were individually wrapped inside a delivery bag. They were all excellent fits an beautiful. will 100% purchase again. xx"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great app but as I hate polyester as it's not eco friendly but most of all it makes my skin sweat really bad, even in ""low percentages"" (for ex. 20%). I'd like a filter to be able to exclude pieces of clothes cointaining polyester from my home and searches. Viscose is cheap but it is eco friendly and gentle to the skin, please use viscose more and less of polyester."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I ordered a pair pf jeans 2 weeks back and I got it in bigger size. I wanted to exchange, this marvelous app has no options for exchange. Also, they ask you to keep the item in case you plan to get changed second time. You have to pay extra money to return which is no where mentioned. It has been weeks I haven't got my refund and to top everything there is no customer care number to connect with them. This is one of the worst apps out there, order at your own risk! A"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Was gonna buy some shirts but the cupon only lets you use it on certin items. Sad as I was gonna spend 80s bucks but since they want to be greedy I guess someone else will get my money.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The application is great and the setup is amazing. But shipping and stock control is just absolutely horrible. I placed an order twice with express delivery, both times I was told there was an error with the delivery. Items that showed in the system as shipped went out of stock and I was left losing out on items I wanted along with deals. I was given 50 cents worth of points for the inconvenience the first time. The second time I was told to just use standard shipping."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this app!! 💗 The clothes are true to fit so make sure you take measurements for you or who you're buying for or up size 1. The clothes are of great quality, not cheaply made. They have super cute clothes for babies & on up even for men. They have all types of great quality accessories jewelry, phone, cases, etc. You can earn points to get free items. They also have a way to get free items W/out points. It's a great app. I recommend it to everyone! You will not be disappointed!💯"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"App is good. Just it switched me to a different country and can't fix it.. have to contact them for support. Have no manually option to set it up.. even do my domestic address is USA based still automatically change to a different country. So annoying.. tried reinstalling and work for a minute and once I close it and reopened, was back to some other country site."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Great app, has sizing and measurements on the items, always shows you similar items to what you are looking for, has a variety of items, from clothing to home items. I love this app But my only concern is the delivery, can you please let go of ARAMEX, iv always had a problem with them and I'm not the only one, you get a nice sale from Shein but must pay all that money back and even more to ARAMEX, almost double what you paid in charges 🧐, makes the whole app seem like a scam."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"to be truthful, i only downloaded because i was curious how it would compare to romwe. upon finding exact matches on both apps, i found price differences ranging 5cents to 4 dollars, so i'd suggest just shopping off romwe <33 regarding item quality, i love everything i get (after looking at materials reviews etc, i only take reviews that are v detailed or with pics into consideration) but most of it eventually needs a bit of basic sewing for repairs or modifications <333"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Fast and mostly good quality stuff there have been a few things I have just thrown away. No good, doesn't work."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love ordering unique and fun clothes and items from SheIn. It doesn't break the bank, and the delivery, and return services are fabulous. No issues trying to figure out where something is or when it will arrive. The app is super easy to use. Some of the items aren't top quality but if you read and know your fabrics, you'll figure out what is better than the others. (My return was simply an exchange. I've haven't been disappointed with a purchase yet)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Pathetic app! I had purchased 2 products in May. The order got delivered after 1.5 months in June 2020. The quality of product is pathetic. Now the real pain starts. We have been trying to return the product but are getting NIL support. On selecting return pick up order, it says that the area does not comes under pick up service. We stay in the heart of bangaluru main city. If shein cannot pick up the order from prime location, then there intention is dubious."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is good, just sick of the day and night messages they send, & back to back messages, its more daily messaging then all my friends and job combined. My first thought is always it's my kids, & I could get into an accident rushing to check the non-stop messages while driving! The app is not worth the frustration it brings because of this!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Brilliant ❤️❤️ I have bought many many items of clothing and shoes from Shien and I have loved every one of them, I've never experienced any problems with anything all the sizes were perfect and great quality and definitely great value for your money. I would definitely recommend that you at least have a look before you just swipe past the app trust me it'll be worth it 😁"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The clothes fit awesome the quality of the clothes is normal for how cheap they are they are always giving discounts with free shipping I can get 10 shirts for under 100$ it's a snag forsure! Also the shipping has gotten better over the months it used to take up to a month to receive my packages but now it takes 3-7 days. Definitely worth the money an the wait!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The price and variety of styles at Shein are great. They're leading the pack with the ""one- on-one"" with their customers. From their Live Shopping experiences to daily flash sales, you will be intrigued at what is to happen next. Their customer service represenatives are one of the best. I do recommend them if shopping on a budget. They only lack of few things. Irregularity of clothing, does happen. And unavailabilty of sizes does as well. In which could happen at any ""newer"" company."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,My parcel has been marked received yesterday whilst I have not receive it. The evri delivery driver decided to take a picture of the parcel in front of the house by himself and took the parcel back and also marked it as delivered (That is stealing) . This app should have a place a customer can mark a parcel ' Not Received ' for shein to know that the item has not been received so that they can contact the thief company called Evri to find out why. I am really not happy at all.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"💜 it, but needs improvements. the reviewing system is too flawed. unhelpful reviews (lyrics, texts and pics that have nothing to do with the product) get uploaded and get in the way of ACTUAL reviews being seen 1st. sometimes I have to scroll all the way down to see a helpful one. buyers should only be able to review a product after receiving it, not before. most items are loaded w/ people begging for points. and points expire way too fast so I get discouraged to check in everyday. 🤷‍♀️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm giving a 3, sometimes shipping is alot longer then expected. ETA doesn't always update. Some products are not accurately described. The points system is confusing. Almost all of the clothing is made from the same type of material. That being said I absolutely love the leggings, regardless of price, their ultra soft and look great with heels or tennis shoes. Dress em up, dress them down at the end of the day you look great and feel comfortable"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love the app. Runs smoothly. No issues with bugs or glitches. As for shein themselves, they're great! No issues with any of the items I've bought, be it clothes or accessories! Always delivered on time, sometimes before the due date-yay! Great offers on there! The only problem I have with it is that I find it addictive and have skinted myself 🤨"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love the deals. Not great but good quality. Way too many notifications, texts and emails."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Useful app. I usually shop for clothes and accessories via this app. I usually get five items per purchase, and they sometimes cost under $20 (shipping not included). The shipping fee for me is less than $5, you have opportunities to earn coupons, you earn points for reviewing items, referring others, and many in-app activities that earn you points that can go towards your next purchase. The points do expire, but there is leg room to allow them to build up before your next purchase."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible. I have not heard of COD fee being added to the original price in any of the other shopping apps... also, the mechanics of pickup service charge is absolutely absurd. No other app charges extra for pickups. Basically, I'm losing the amount of money required for the pickup charge... So basically it's a loss."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My order of 130 dollars never arrived and no refund basically they stole my money. Buy Be ware. They are scammers
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Easily resolved the problems. The products are good. The price is right. Shipping is fast. The customers services are very professional that helped me satisfied to solved the problem. I love the styles of the products and the quality are durable. Lots of choices. I enjoyed there sales and promotional discounts. Very impressive online store that you can save money to spend but many products you can have it. The communication with you and store can reach right away if ever there is changes order.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very, very poor customer service you send email more than 1million time's and no one will reply or respond to you , very poor workers and poor service.."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein! The prices of everything are outstanding and the little outfit competitions are so fun and a great way to show off your style and see other people's ideas. If every item you have in your wishlist could show up to be used when entering a contest insyead of just the most recent saves, then that wouod ve a lot more helpful."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app works perfectly. I haven't experienced any issues and I use it way too often. As a seller, Shein has a wide variety of selections and great prices. Since items come from different manufacturers quality isn't always guaranteed, but there seems to be some sort of quality control within the system which created a more comfortable shopping environment by allowing the consumer to trust the product they purchase is the product they will receive. I recommend this app to other users."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love the deep discounts on clothes, underwear, and accessories. The only thing I don't like is that the sizing can be inconsistent. I also have a difficult time finding bikinis or bra and underwear sets that are the right size for me because I'm much smaller in my chest than in my waist and hips, so a size 2x or 3x will fit my bottom half, but a 2x top would be to big for me. I've always had a difficult time finding clothes that fit me perfectly."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app itself is great, it's not confusing, there's many categories, and I like how it shows your order when being shipped. On most shopping apps it just says if it's shipped and delivered, but this one they say what USPS station it's at which is great. The wish list has boards so you can organize your items, and there's many opportunities for coupons. Products are usually cheaply made but that's what reviews are for. Overall great app :)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. I order fun journaling papers, stickers, etc from them and they by far have the best prices out there. And I'm always blown away by how fast my order arrives all the way from China, usually 7 or 8 days only! The app also has fun little ways to earn points that add up quickly to use toward your next order. And $4 shipping if you're under the minimum order amount. I've paid more for shipping from another part of my own state, and it's taken longer to arrive! So glad I found SheIn!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely love this company/app Their stuff is amazing quality and prices are good. They are super helpful and efficient if you experience any issues and rectify it straight away. My daughter loves all their products the app is so easy to use and can keep track of orders via the app everything you need is right there at your fingertips in the app definitely 10/10 for me, there are not many ads (if any at all as I can't recall seeing any which says it all)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Love the app but it's telling me I can't redeem my points after I sent my reference codes to my friends I would have gotten the reward but it is now telling my that I have cheated and used third party apps which I never did which made me kind of upset
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love a good Shein overhaul 🥰 The variety of clothes and accessories to lingerie and shoes is just endless! The best thing is the pricing! OH, did I mention they have something for every body, shape, height and weight! They typically ship really quickly and so far i can't complain with any of my purchases!! Just read reviews if available so you get an idea of the size you need, then after that, happy shopping! You'll be hooked #Sheinoverhaul"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've discovered SHEIN recently. I have made many orders already, each consists of multiple items. Clothing is beautiful and well made, very stylish and fashionable. Absolutely my style! While Amazon (whose shopper I was for a long time) increased their prices through the roof, SHEIN offers affordable prices and great discounts. As someone who cares about style and fashion and beautiful clothing, I feel extremely grateful. The app is very easy to navigate, and offers great suggestions."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Your emails and notifications are ridiculous. I have no urge to go on the app because you have bombarded me with notifications!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good products and shipping time is acceptable. I love the products but it's difficult to set up returns. You need to review each and every product on your list before you even reach the product you want to return. I ended up leaving the product with me. That particular product was missing an item. It only happened once though, everything is good specially the Sheglam."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Affordable and cute. Just about everytime I've ordered I've been happy with the stuff. You can't beat the value. There's many things like the dresses that are so pretty and as described. Never had an issue with items nit as pictured. Haven't had to return anything so can't speak about the returns. Very easy to navigate app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Have had a really good experience so far with shein. I've ordered 2 times so far. Very cheap prices and fast delivery however the tracking numbers provided aren't real but the tracking is. Received my order within 5days from when I placed it. Great phone case prices and good for buying small accessories. Haven't bought clothes yet as my size are different for different clothing.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, if you pay attention to review photos you'll have a better understanding of what you're going to get. All online shopping sites have issues, but Shein rewards you for shopping with them and they offer fair return policies. I'm not wealthy by any metric, so it's nice to get points and coupons regularly. I've finally been able to curate a decent wardrobe for less than I'd spend at Walmart. You gotta wait up to 3 weeks sometimes, but it's worth it for me anyways."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"No bad experience at all, talks of easy methods of payment to quality of the clothes, easy acces to the website to order is fantastic, product is wonderful and value for money, is only sometimes I orders clothes that is too big or too small, my problems is I don't know how to return, apart from that enjoy variety of products. I'm always eager to recommend"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I LOVE this app SM! Everytime I order something it's always true to size and really comfortable. One thing I would Most definitely reccomend is for you to buy the thick quality clothing and you'll know by the reviews once you read through them and especially look at pictures (Most of the time its a little more expensive than others but worth it 😂). Other than that it's a great app, and rlly good for clothing, assecrios, etc.!!!❤👊🏽😋"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have yet to get anything of bad quality from shein. I spend maybe $100 each time I shop with them and get triple the items I would anywhere else and everything has been beyond what I expected. Hoping that doesn't change. Shipping normally takes 2-4 weeks. Love them and seriously I recommend it to everyone. Sizing is great as well.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I've made 2 orders weigh the app and I live it. My only issue is trying to figure out the right size. A few of the items on my first order ended up being too big based on the size guides because of my body type. So always check out the customer reviews. Many will include a photo of the customer actually wearing the item as well as their measurements making it easier to gauge the size.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Nice app.. Nice collection at reasonable rates... But the return policy is not at all good... It's showing like address that the dress is been delivered is ineligible for the return pickup.. So you have to return the item yourself which is not at all customer friendly experience.. Also the return period is not specified.. How come we know the return period over or not? Bad experience with the return pickup.. If they can deliver a item,why can't they pickup the item from that same address?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Non-stop notifications with no way to disable them
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I ordered two items in July and never got the items that still say it's in transit since July 14 it's now October 14 and I still don't have items nor is shein willing to help given my money back I won't ever order from this site or recommend anyone else to just crooks
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"No consistency, either way too big or way too small. Received 2 garments that were torn on arrival (as though they have previously been tried on, damaged then returned. I love the idea of bigger clothes and there are some nice items but some are crudly made and resulting in the garment looking cheap. However, the app is good, easy to use and class Shein as a bigger clothing outlet I would definitely recommend."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,All products are available and good
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The worst shopping apps. I don't recommend to any user out there because it's a waste of time. The delivery service is not trustable and relaible. The SHEIN customer service never had time to address the issues instead give false date. The courier partner as well updated all the stupid and nonsense excuses. Their delivery agent never answer call or respond to text.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Sketchy with pricing. You're charged more on your order. But when you check your receipt, a lower price is listed. Yet the lower rate is not what they charged you. I don't mind paying for my items, but be consistent across the board and don't charge me a higher price and list a lower one. That's going to make me not trust you. I will never order from you again!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like your option where you can return items and the refund is fast once the item has been received and its quality checked. Just need to improve on the tracking part. Should be updated from time to time and delivered within the said time frame. Also, I'd like to suggest you use better fabrics in your dresses and tops. Your dresses have thin fabrics, not durable although I like the print and style. And the tops, try using sophisticated fabrics that would suit its style. Not just rib knit. Okay?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like Shein because eventho clothes are not the best quality, they have very affordable prices and a great amount of things to chose from. I purchase a lot from Shein and the service is excellent also the time between ordering and getting your order is not too long and when something doesn't come or is lost they go Adobe and beyond to fix it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this website. They have very trendy styles at inexpensive prices. If I were to purchase the same Styles at other boutiques would cost me double what I pay on Shein. The quality on some of the clothes is a little cheap but the price is also cheaper so you get what you pay for. I have never received items coming from China faster than when I do with this website. It takes about 7 days for my order to reach me with their free shipping option. Excellent customer service, very professional."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Honestly the app clothing app, in my opinion. Very cheap, such great material! Shipping is surprisingly fast, considering its from china!! I love this app overall. Has everything from belts, shoes, hats, socks, makeup , hair accessories, glasses, dresses, shirts, jeans, rompers and two pieces, everything you could think of! I very much love this app. I could never find clothes these cute where I live , and for this cheap and such comfy, great material"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Love the products though I tend to have trouble when purchasing items. I had a coupon for free shipping on orders over $29 and when I tried to use it the website took items out of my cart after I paid my balance. I know it was after b/c on my order review all of my items were there until I paid then it showed I was missing items so basically I tried to use my free shipping coupon and ended up paying for shipping twice
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have nothing but good things to say about this brand. From the prices to the variances in product -this is my go to app for mostly anything. I love the kids section which offer matching mommy daughter outfits to toddler pieces fit for a fashion show. For the price range the pieces are of good quality and the color combination allows for a variety options. I recommend this app to any and everyone! You won't be disappointed.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I use this app like it's another social media platform lol no issues with it so far and I have used it to shop many times before making this review..... Though my views on the shopping experience hasn't changed I did find a problem after loosing my phone. the app data is connected only to the device used first. so even though I logged in my credentials on another device my data was not transferred 😭 it's like starting on a clean slate, all my points and achievement level benefits are gone!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Very poor service, for return and exchange. A very cumbersome process, where in you have to first mail customer.er care, then they will give you some code etc, then you can return the item, and then place a fresh order for exchange. And the amount refunded into the shein wallet, cannot even be used easily. Have to go thru another round of hassle for that !!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is surprisingly excellent. This app is easy to use, has never crashed, and has great products. I was fearful that the cloths I ordered would be very small, but they were true to size. That said over 50% of my order was too large. SHEIN covered my return(exchange) for the right size items. The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 is the amount of time it took to get my order, otherwise I love SHEIN."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have had no problems with any items sent to me! I love it all. The shipping is has always ran about 7ish days, which I like. However I am a little bummed with the point system and ""free giveaways"" I love the check in points daily, but the review points I don't always get although I did review as specified for points. And as far as the free giveaways, that's a VERY RARE thing."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great clothes but the happy flip game is rigged. It's so obvious too, you allow people to get soo many gems but every time you hit one, you get a coupon that'll soon expire. And then, you can't even use multiple coupons so all those coupons are just wasted. It's stupid really, but other than that, I love the clothes part. Just hate that the app is always showing the games and trying to get me to play them. I'm not playing the games anymore cause they're rigged, but I'll still buy clothes😌"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I buy from shein nearly every week, their products are just so fun to shop. However, u get what u pay for so make sure to read reviews and look at the photos of the item you're planning on buying. Their customer service is great, so even if you get something you're not happy with, just contact customer service and they'll help u out!! This app is great and it's so convenient to use, great work shein :)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app works very well so my rating for that is five star. For SHEIN itself I am giving four star. Although there are lots to choose from and the prices are good for some items and really good for others, I feel the site must expand more. I am a gamer for example and I would also like to see more gaming items, gear and accessories like more gaming specific clothes, linen, carpets etc. plus figurines, games, consoles, posters, controls, chargers... and the list goes on. I would really like that."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"the apps good just dont pay $13 dollars for fast shipping wont work, so delayed and you cant even actually contact them (i already did that absolutely nothing helped its all robots that say the same thing"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been using shein to get clothes for over a year now I trust the sizing more than I would at the store with way cheaper prices. It's the price of a thrift or department store but with good quality things. I even get other thinhs from it like my ring light and makeup brushes, led lights, and cute accessories. Only problem is shipping time but that's completely fine."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this shop. Sales go on really cute aesthetic clothes and have all kinds of styles for all kinds of people. Im actually a woman but ive ordered lots of mens clothes on the site completely satisfied, just as much as their dresses i ordered. They also have a shipping insurance fee, its optional, but its only a dollar to assure that if your order gets lost they'll fully replace it for free. As long as you read the reviews about sizing, you should have a very good shopping experience."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Made a few orders off Shein, so far 85% has been great, the other 15% hasn't been so good....bought a few bits for the Xmas tree & they arrived broken & missing bits, it might be very easy but I personally can't find a way to make a complaint, or get money back etc. I know most items say no return policies. I also bought a few spare molds but 1 of the sets came warped (so is useless) & the other set again was missing bits."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really like the trendy stuff here, but there are few problems, i was very dissapointed 1 that they charge for secure delivery, it is the responsibility on the particular online portal to deliver its products safely. 2 i had fer shein points from my previous order, i went to cart and the points were applicable, for some reason i had to go back to my wishlisthem when I finally checked out, the points were not applicable. 3 Cash to delivery is not applicable to every place."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is good but I'm only giving three stars because I keep getting recommended cute clothes that are always size 12/14 and I'm a size 16 so it becomes really frustrating. There are clothes my size but they are very basic things that can be bought anywhere, I downloaded because of the unique dress designs but all the items that can't be found anywhere else are only in small sizes : ( I don't know if there's anything you can do about that but if possible I would love to talk to you guys"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love this online store! I have purchased with them a total of 15 orders and each time with at least 5 items and have only once been disappointed, but the customer service made up for it completely! I have gotten nothing but amazing quality products, and never pay full price with all the points, coupons, and afterpay made a available to me! I have already convinced my mother to buy a haul of items and she was satisfied. I 100% recommend SHEIN!!! ❤👌"

The only issue I have is it promotes coupons that don't get you anywhere, just so you open the app .. and start looking around . It's quite annoying . I've stop clicking them already . And I'm going to remove from my phone notifications ."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Shein has Never once has managed to deliver me a parcel. Really good looking stuff and so cheap but not very reliable for shipping. I always manage to get a refund its just annoying not having my things arrive. I've checked my address and it's the right address not mistakes or anything. All of my family and friends have had no problem ordering and getting their stuff. I really hope I can find a way to fix this. It would be a shame to have to delete the app and send in a complain to the Ceo
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is top tier when it comes to affordable, sustainable, and quality fashion choices. Not only do they have a wide variety of products but they have something for everyone. Clothing options are infinite show choices are endless and even their household items are to die for. Let's not forget their beauty section. I have some eyeshadow palettes that could easily compete with the high end stuff. I love shein and would recommend 10/10."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I just fall in love with SHIN each and every products are soo good which I got, quality, materials,size are 💯 comfortable. Every things are really good except the return option. It's really hard, really very hard to return your products. I think this online fashion shopping app should make this return option easy to use for all of lovely ladies."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"At first I wasn't sure about the app but I ordered my first big order and it was better than expected! Amazing quality stuff for my toddler and amazing prices, you get lots of deals and discounts plus wee games or chances to win. Deliver only took a week and you can track it from the country it came from. If I had more money I would be ordering all the time"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really fun app/website, has stuff for ANYONE! Quality seems to be getting a little better but sizing is still questionable on some clothing. I wish it was more consistent, and the shipping could be quicker. Sometimes the order is split into multiple boxes, sometimes it takes forever, sometimes they're super fast... Again, needs CONSISTENCY. But overall, I'm kinda addicted regardless. LOL. Thank you SHEIN! 🥰"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Not a bad app. They should really show when an item has been bought already. I've pitched duplicates often because it will advertise and show the same clothes even after purchase. I spend a lot of time going back to make sure I didn't buy it already. The clothes are okay quality. You have to really pay attention to the material, the sizes and the reviews because the sizes are never the same. I can be a small in one outfit and a size large in another. It's strange."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Bad app. When you return product, the credit is refunded in app wallet which can not be withdrawn. You have to compulsary purchase though you find costly, bad product. Very bad. Better to use other apps rather than this. They are providing good facility for your money and payment. If i can give the review in minus then i would love to do. :("
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Never use this application, when you order a product for more than 50 dollars they steal it and there is no way to contact them, you just waste your time with their instructions"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best place to buy affordable yet stylish clothes. Shein is my go to store for every occasion big or small. I am kinda addicted to this app. It provides daily points for check-in where 100 points is equal to 1 US dollar. They provide points for delivery confirmation, reviewing their products and many ways to collect points which further can be deducted from the total payable amount on the next purchase. The delivery takes nearly 7 days from the day of shipment. The quality is no doubt incredible."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"SHEIN charges you extra when you buy over a certain amount and they never tell you. When you return some items, the items that you buy become more expensive. They are sneaky and dishonest. Don't buy from them. You think you are paying less, but, in the end you pay more."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"honestly you can find really nice quality things on here. You need to read the reviews on the product you are looking at before getting buying it. Sometimes you'll need to size up or size down, I have only had one item I didnt enjoy and that was my fault because I didnt fully read the sizing on it before buying it, it was just way to big. I buy from Shein regularly, and it's usually a big haul. I will always recommend their bathing suits. So diverse!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"There's a good structure to the app once you get used to it. They have contests and flash sales and real time shows that make it soooo much better than a typical shopping app. I love most that they give new designers a way to do what they love. There's a lot more, but you'll have to check it out for yourself. The clothes range from cheap to expensive, and kid to plus size. Shipping is from the US, so you don't have to wait a month for your order. Highly recommend."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,CHEATING AT THEIR CONTEST I have 2 phones only difference between them is one is slow. theyre both synced up having all the same accounts. I was using the slow one and entered a win 100$ on the app. I got 435/500 using free chances. I shared with 5 friends who all joined. I ended up with only 3 accounts linking getting me to 495/500 and I assumed it was cuz my slow phone. I opened the app on my other phone. it reset me back to 435. I refreshed both phones multiple times and was left with 435.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is so great! There is fashionable style and it's very good quality.The shipping is pretty quick.It comes in less then two weeks.The only problem I had is that I bought a phone case that for my phone, but then my phone broke and I got a new one, but when it came in It didn't fit so I tried to return it and I couldn't get my money back so I still had to pay shipping."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Amazing app. I was very sceptical so my first order was only 3 pieces as a trial. They high fashion with very low prices. Quality is okay for the price u pay. I love that they awarding u with points that u can then convert to a redemption of the price. Also the reviews with pictures r super helpfuland very fast shipping. Of course not all pieces will be a hit but it's a gamble we take with online shopping. For me personally I am happy with every piece i ordered so far. Thank you Shein
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Ahhh fast fashion is terrible BUT shop wisely ~ buy things you'll wear more than once! Which is exactly what I have done & absolutely love everything I have brought. Easy to navigate and also visually pleasing! (although some photos are Soooo obviously photo shopped 🤣). Pro Tip: Look at the reviews with photos of the actual items. Overall easy and affordable for people who can't buy luxurious items.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am editing my review as once you have an issue you realize how bad their business practices are. They held my order for 10 days and then notified me that they don't have an item I ordered. After 10 days! They cancelled the item, split my order into 2 shipments. It has been 18 days now. One shipment has allegedly been shipped, the other one still hasn't left China after 18 days of processing! The cherry on top: No customer service for you to contact AT ALL!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"If your looking for high quality clothes that fit like a glove...it's ok. Usually it a bit of a gamble on whether it's going to fit so tip is to ALWAYS size up. If you just need something really simple, like an oversized hoodie, then it's good. Just be careful of any tops or short skirts/shorts, they can be see-through and are usually a bit fiddly if there a buttons on it. You really do get what you pay for. Shop safe guys!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The estimated price is a scam, the final price is always higher. It's a Chinese company"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love SHEIN! The prices are great and I've never had an issue with shipping/delivery times. I've only purchased one item that was kinda ""meh"" but it was an $8 dress so no real complaint. The only thing I kinda pout about is that I've lost a lot of weight over the past year and I have to shop the ""curvy/full figure"" section with SHEIN but that's sheer vanity🤣😂🤣 It would also be a plus if the shoes came in bigger sizes... some of us have BIG feet!!!🤣😂🤣 Other than that SHEIN is perfect!"

On top of that, it never shows any tracking information,it just shows when it shipped. And if something goes wrong there's no way to talk to customer service. Your just stuck!! I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Great site/app for shopping, if it would work right! I am a regular customer, but my app and the website continuously get internal errors and completely stop working. I love the clothes and items items have purchased so far but this issue with the app/website not working is disappointing for me, and has resulted in a lower rating than what I would like to give."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Good clothes but worst customer service. I bought 33 items and paid hefty amount. I just need to exchange 4 items out of it, and it's been more than a week I'm not able to do it. Their customer service takes long to reply. And moreover I need to pay for the shipping of return. Such a shame that a big company like this can't take exchange expenses of 4 items of a customer who paid for 33 items. I heard a lot about shein and it was my very first purchase, very very disappointed."

The prices are AMAZING, thought because of it, I do find myself ordering more than I intend to! Lol The customer service is great. The quality of the products are great *a few duds but you get those in store, too. Overall, SHEIN is well worth it! I'm glad I forget about this app after a bit since I wouldn't be able to keep up! 😅"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Searching is still an issue it gives items that are not what is requested. Items are unavailable or no longer offered.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is good, but the standout feature is that they have eliminated the every frustration one has when ordering clothing from amazon or wish. The sizes are uniform and consistent across styles. The quality of each item is good too. Your cart items are processed and collected into a single package before shipping, versus 15 single packages. The order is shipped dhl which is actually trackable, and arrives in a reasonable amount of time 1-2 weeks. All this even in a covid environment. Excellent"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Ordered over 2 months ago and haven't received items yet. I understand the delays with all companies at this time. I ordered from 2 other companies at the same time and have received my shipments. Hoping everything is in good shape, fits well and worth the purchase and the wait. Easy to maneuver website and they had cute items. Will change stars if satisfied with shipment once I receive it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'd admit i was sceptical at first. You know most online shopping you get it in a different condition or you're waiting months. But shein is amazing! You get exactly what you pay for and the pricing is so cheap. And you get get basically anything you want kids clothes, mens clothes, plus size and even homey items. I've bought many things and haven't had a problem yet! The app is so easy to use aswell."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Absolutely amazing 90% of the time the clothes are right on spot size wise and they come in sooner than they say (only at first) 3 months later.. ...... Shein is Infamous about stealing points from you so if you're trying to collect points don't that's not worth it. Also shipping is way to long for when I actually pay to receive an item within a time period. Have to order 3/4 weeks ahead if not more. If you're looking to get (earn) something in return this is not the place
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A good app for reasonably priced clothing household goods and stationary. Its important to read the reviews so you get an accurate idea of clothing size and fabric quality. As that can vary. Happy with everything I've bought so far, and the shipping was fairly fast and reasonably priced or free over a certain amount. Only criticism is that they won't ship to po boxes so for people like me in rural Canada it can be hard to find an alternative place to ship to that they will accept."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great site! Cheap prices, decent quality, huge selection, all sizes. EDIT: 17 Dec 2022 Day 3 of not being able to check in for points, all I get is a blank screen. This would happen before sometimes for 1 day and I would go back to one point instead of getting the higher points but never before for 3 days in a row. Also get a blank page when I click on customer service so I can't even talk to them about this. Can someone fix this ?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"So far I'm not impressed! I feel like I'm paying more money for cheap quality, just cuz the brand I guess. You'd think it wouldn't be so expensive! Especially cuz most items look like items I'd find at Forever 21, or Rue 21, only SHEIN is more expensive for poorer quality. I've also found similar panties, bras, small tank tops & other under garments/lingerie items, on Wish. Yet the stuff on Wish is generally of better or similar quality, but on Wish the prices are lower too. It's disappointing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've lost count of how many bargains I've found using Shein. Most of these budget online shops, of course, you have to be choosy. I'm sure there probably are low quality things but to be fair, I've not been disappointed yet. Also a lot of products on there I've not come across before that really appeal, and a large variety of everything on there. If you want a ""realistic"" idea of how an item of clothing will look if you aren't a leggy, ""perfect 10"", there are almost always photos in the reviews."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very low prices for stylish clothes for all settings (casual, formal, sporty, party, etc). Not going to claim that EVERYTHING is high quality, but I have ordered $200+ worth of clothes (which is a lot given most items I have ordered were less than $10 each) and 98% of it is of surprising quality. Would recommend."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is so good! There's a large variety of things to buy ranging from clothes to house decor. It's so easy to organise your fav items since you can make boards after adding them to your favourites. One thing I will complain about is how long it takes for things to ship sometimes but I don't really mind. Overall, it's an amazing app!! Definitely recommend 👌"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Prices have gone up exceedingly for not very good quality items, you're lucky if you get the correct size and your item isn't crappy material. We used to let the quality of the items slide because of how cheap they were, but now the app is asking for a lot more for the same items. Delivery takes up to months. And shipping is expensive."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Overall SHEIN has very good deals but I think the set up of the actual site has room for improvement when it comes to checking out. Why do you need to 'select' items that you have already added to the cart? Here I am thinking I have all the items I want ready to go but I missed out on a few as they automatically weren't 'selected.' If the set up were better and I didn't miss items I would've given a full rating of 5 stars. ⭐⭐⭐
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"DONT PAY WITH ANYTHING OTHER THAN CARD!!!! I tried paying in PayPal, but after 5 minutes of processing I figured something was wrong and it didn't go through, so I backed out and ofc it said it didn't go through so I canceled and remade the order this time doing it on my card. It went through almost instantly but when I went to check my bank account to make sure it was charged...IT CHARGED ME DOUBLE. But other than that, this is an awesome clothing app, prices are reasonable and realistic"

Oh, you need a refund? ""It takes 2-6 business days"" but what they really mean is, ""give us 30 minutes max."" Same with shipping. ""Sept 30th"" but reality is ALWAYS ""sept 27-28th"" Sometimes packages get stuck in transit for a day or two, but they always arrive either early or on time. Plus, you get points just for logging in! Those really stack up."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love the fact like many others that you can see pictures of the item on people who have previously bought it.. sizing chart could do with being more accurate I've bought stuff going by sizing chart some have been to big some to small and some perfect I never really know what size to buy.. Great quality so far I have only been disappointed by one item that looked like thick material in the picture but was extremely thin material I sent it back and was refunded straight away no fuss easy returns
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love SheIn they have the cutest clothing for everyone. I did most of my clothing shopping for Xmas on SheIn and they arrived on time and most of the products were exactly what I was hoping for, I love that everything is cheap, trendy and comfortable. Only thing I think could be better is the shipping time and how quickly your order arrives other than that, I love the deals & shopping on the app!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been enjoying shopping on SHEIN for the past few months and never had any problems, everything came on time. Unfortunately, I have recently got trouble ordering where everytime I click on 'place order' it says 'your account is suspended dud to irregular activities' . I don't know if thus is due to the recent update or what but please can you fix it asap because I have lost out on several purchases. Thank you."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I got the clothes in reasonable time, but they are designed for someone 5'5"" or under, definitely too petite. Also surprise! You owe $30 in import fees (I'm in Canada) that weren't mentioned previously when you paid for shipping and have to be paid before you can receive your package. The sizing was all over the place depending on garment, when I had used their sizing on the site by height/weight."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So far absolutely love it. I've made 3 separate orders, the coupons they give you regularly are just amazing and it's literally adult Christmas 😂🤣. Will definitely be buying a lot more. Oh and I wanted to mention I know a lot of people say because it's overseas based or whatever that it'll take months to get your order. It is international shipping, shipping IS very very acceptable priced AND the longest its taken to get is a little over a week. So so worth it!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Pros: - Much better than website (but website doesn't load at all half the time) - Relatively cheap items, decent quality - Actually reliable sizing- better than I expected for price range! Cons: Could be vastly improved - User interface is confusing - ""Payment methods"" seems buggy: I'd like to add another credit card, but nothing shows up when I open that section. - My last order took nearly 2 wks (13 days) to ship, w/ paid shipping! Not sure if this is a coronavirus thing or a SHEIN thing."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Shein is verrrryyyyy addictive and extremely worthwhile. Shipping is fast and all items arrive in perfect condition. I've shopped for both small child and adult male and female over the past year and some. Prices are great/very affordable and 98% of all purchases fit. I've spent and still spend a lot of time and money on here...recently got caught up shopping for household items. Super glad I was introduced to Shein!! Loving it
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Decent enough - very useful but some things are very overpriced (£30 for a cardigan I could get locally for £18?!) Which, by the way, had a massive hole after one wear. However - it has such a wide array of items there's always something to suit your needs. BUT it's impossible to search for anything efficiently. Fitler options need to be better and it's encouraging fast fashion so much! Also - always, always pay attention to the material!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's amazing lots of varieties of products 😍 for cheap too so good for when your on a budget. And its always good to read the reviews👍just to make sure the product is good and durable🤌. I love that there are customer feed back on each of products like whether the clothes you're looking at are stretchy or true to size or whether they run in a smaller size. Am a plus size person so that's the first thing I look for before I buy my clothes.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is easy to order items and look for items. I find the returns a bit long winded to complete , it took me that long how to return somethings that it's too late to return some items. Returns would be easy if you got a paper invoice in your parcel with the options of returns and returns labels enclosed. I work full time don't have a printer , items would get returned much quicker if invoices, return codes and return labels were enclosed. I'd much more likely to recommend to my friends and family"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the different styles and reasonable prices. The app is amazing, super user friendly. Shipping can be just a bit long but I don't care because it's definitely worth the wait. The clothes are good quality and trendy as well as great classic pieces. Returns are extremely simple. I really love shopping at Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So they have nice style clothing and even some nice other things but they suck at there delivery services. I ordered from them three times, each time something was either missing from the order, wasn't delivered at all, or they had run out of the items after I had bought it. This time they wouldn't even allow me to let them know that my package wasn't even delivered. If you'd like to still buy clothes injury somewhat like this app I suggest rainbow 😌"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"As for getting your orders, that's been great. They've come on time or a day earlier. I've only had one bad experience and that was with a pair of ear rings. I received them with one damaged, tried to exchange them and wasn't able to. And for a $1.50, it wasn't worth the effort but still being disappointed. (Picked them to go with a certain dr And for my returns I had no problems, it went smoothly. The clothes that I have pick are very nice and comfortable with the cost being of great value."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Honestly an amazing app. It's great for people like me who find it hard to find my sizes and clothing style at a price I can manage as a young broke teen. Absolutely amazing! Quality shifts depending on what you buy, but everything is affordable and beautiful tbh. They have great ways for customers to help each other out with opinions and ratings of whatever it is they bought. Super easy to use and they even have extended sizes for plus ladies !"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So far my experience has been excellent. My first order arrived before it was expected and even though one bathing suit didn't fit, I had no problems at all getting a refund. Since I am plus size, it's difficult to find just the Right fit. This site gives u measurements and customers also post pictures of themselves in their reviews. That makes it easier to see how something might look on your own figure. And finding a good fitting and flattering suit is often hard."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I ordered some items for my daughter for xmas and i was so surprised at the quality of the items. Many times I've ordered something and it was thin and cheaply made. Nothing here is. I am sooooo happy with my purchases and the shipping was super fast. 3-5 days faster then they told me it would be. This is a GREAT place to shop and has become my number one spot. There cheap but not at all cheaply made.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Huge selection of clothing and shoes for all with great prices. The app works flawlessly and is easy to navigate. I placed an order and recieved all items in 8 days. The quality of materials was superb. The wife loves the bathing suits. Make sure you read reviews while shopping as some items run smaller than expected. One of the best sites for the cost conscientious shopper.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love me some Shein!!! Very inexpensive, and fairly well made products. The jeans are especially awesome! My only critique would be about products that are made of or embellished with lace. I got a few underwear sets that were made from lace and after hand washing them one time they fell apart. Everything else has been absolutely amazing. Customer for life!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Love the app and the products. If the app desighn team could in corporate a search option buy fabric style that would be great. Sometimes you find eg. A top in a beautiful fabric/print but you would love it in a dress that falls in a different category. Searching by fabric giving you all items available would be great and avoid a lot of time waisted Searching thru category to find what you looking for in the same fabric. Loving the app anyway 💘
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I would have given this 5 stars but there are few things I would change before I would. See, it's annoying when your points get taken away over time. It's sometimes hard to add them up if they keep disappearing lol. That is my most recent concern. Everything else on this app is helpful! I love to buy clothes from here and even some stationary they have! I would get the app if you are sick of going online to get to it all of the time, plus you get more points."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The best online shopping excellent service you can find best prices so happy
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I didn't receive one of my orders and until I received the product, there was no obvious way of contacting someone for a refund, and the money was not refunded immediately. However, I contacted someone through customer services months later, explained the situation, and received a full refund in under 24 hours! It took a little searching around the app, but once I found what I needed, the customer support service was fast, efficient and professional. Good quality products that arrive promptly."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is absolutely phenomenal!! Firstly, it's easy to use, secondly, when you can't find an exact item you're looking for, you can use the visual search! It's an amazing feature, and just an amazing fashion and decor app over all! Would definitely recommend to people that are interested in downloading this app. I also love that you can get daily coupons and that the items are really cheap! ! So, if you're looking to install this app, please do!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Scams their users with a ""Free gift"" scam. They make you invite users to get your free gift, as you get closer they reduce they continuously reduce the reward you get from each invite. The app should be banned for this. They try to make the app feel like a casino slot machine."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This app used to be great but since the last two updates it crashes all the time. I won't even get to use the app for a minute before it crashes. Please fix this! As for the items themselves a lot of them are super cheap feeling and looking. I hate the polyester material. I know it's cheap for a reason but I would pay more for better quality items. I like their premium line though. They feel higher quality. So please fix the crashes and improve item quality!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The returns and exchange processes of this brand is really horrible. I had loved a piece of cloth, but recieved a defective one and guess what i will have to send it back to shein at my expenses, order it back if i want to continue with my choice (hoping that they don't deliver a defective product this time) and pay extra ""again"" for the shipping of the defect free product for no mistake of mine! Really horribe !"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a great app! Prices are wonderful and most of the clothes are great. As long as you read the reviews under the item, you should have no trouble figuring out the sizing and quality of an item before buying. The real reviews on the site are what I like best. Shipping is fairly quick and always neatly packaged. The first return (per order) is free and processed quickly. You must review the item before you return it. Their points system is awesome! It's so quick and easy to earn credit."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Poor communication, delay of parcels I regret trusting this app It doesn't care whether we receive our orders on time."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great prices, amazing products As amazing as this app is always allow 2 weeks minimum for delivery and always read the review of the products you love to find out if you need to get the next size up, 99.9% of the time the fits are perfect, but like most stores there maybe that 1 item that you may need to get the next size up,. Other than that Happy shopping :)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the fabric of the lingerie it's both comfortable and flattering. The dress I bought fits perfect and the fabric is really fresh and comfortable. The prices are great for the quality of the clothes and accessories. Most sizes are true to size, but I always read reviews and see the review pictures just to be safe. I love that they give you points for reviewing the items you purchase. Overall, its a great app for buying cute clothes and accessories online. Too bad, I want to keep spending."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have ordered from Shein many times now, and each time I am excited to open the package! I have mainly ordered lingerie, and it has always come looking as it said it would. I really appreciate the sizing chart included with each item in the details. I am able to order the right size for me and not second guess. Shipping is reasonably priced even if the minimum order is not reached and the estimated date the items will arrive has been accurate (usually arriving a day early!). Great job!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I ordered something from them and never received it even though it says it was delivered. I've never received a refund and there is no way to get ahold of someone. For that reason I cannot rate.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Delivery of the product takes longer than expected, also the return and refund policy is rediculous and so time taking. It's been four days since my return order has been picked up by the courrier person and it hasn't been shipped yet. The shipment is being delayed everyday. Been it some other shopping platform i would have received the refund within 24 hours of successful pickup of the return by the courrier person. Also they have been lieing that returns are easy and free."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app itself is pretty amazing, easy to navigate and check out is not complicated. The delivery times are spot on! They have always delivered within the estimated time. The quality of the clothes is really good too. The sizing is tricky with all online purchases and varies from item to item. Love ♥️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I like this store alot and they have some good clothes alot of the time. Only few problems was sweater i ordered looked nothing like the picture twice and my head band with spikes came with a spike missing and wasn't even in package it came so i was frustrated bc i really liked the sweaters and headbands and i hate items that have pieces missing! So they need to re check stuff before then send out
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Just spent $400 ordering so many outfits some dirty lingerie tons of jewelry. Store has everything you could imagine and things you never even realize you needed. I will be shopping with this company for years and years and years to come. Always such a great selection. I even found a black pair of stiletto heels for $29 what a steal.Not to mention most of their prices are between 5 and 10 dollars some of the dresses are 18 or 19 but that's very far and few in between.They also have so many sizes
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love SHEin! The only suggestion I'd have on the app is an easier ""shein home page"" button. Love window shopping, making purchases (& the excitement of tracking my orders), & the clothes collage contests. They give me a fun creative outlet even if I don't expect to win; it's a fun way to see what you can come up with within a specific theme. Love feeling myself & being able to treat myself with items from shein. 🤍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Super great, definitely read the washing and drying instructions on the tags of clothing with the screen printed patterns, I pulled a checkered long sleeved crop top and all the white checkers melted together and my sleeve was bonded shut. Everything is good though, I've loved everything I've gotten so far. The option to make payments on orders is very great that's an excellent idea"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The only bad thing is I'm obsessed with this app!!!! It's a genius marketing strategy and super cute!!! I also really enjoy the product's I have perched and will DEFINITELY order again!!! Nice work!!! My only concern is that when I enter the ""shows"" contests my entries are never there so I never have a chance.. Also I have never been able to receive points or anything when I share anything from your app that offers"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I'm getting constant messages on my phone I want them to stop .I've only signed up wanted to order but the messages are extremely intrusive
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I haven't ordered anything quite yet, but I have my cart FULL of beautiful & unique clothing that I am about to order. I always check reviews because when you are buying online you have the risk of it looking complety different than what you wanted, or not fitting right; but all the pictures of delivered product looks exactly like they're supposed to! Shein has clothing that is exactly my style and even better. And the prices are amazing 🙀 👏 prices start from $5-$30 I was surprised! Can't wait"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I don't know if I am the only noticing this The umbrella and some products I bought form Shein is good condition however, the price of the Product is to high, unlike the other Shopping online app.."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Being petite, it's so nice to be able to order clothes that actually fit me! I will say that the size charts are a bit off but once you get the hang of which size fits you best, you're good to go. The return process is super easy as well! The items are incredibly affordable! The only downfall is that a lot of the clothes will need to be layered just due to them being a bit thin and see through."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I did a previous review on this app. And I feel now I was being to harsh. They deserve 5 stars because their items always ship really fast. Also they items are equal to the price. The app works well. I would love to give tips on shopping on the website. Your probably going to want to size up 1 or 2 sizes on most clothing pieces. There jewelry is good for the price. I was just upset because of the points thing,but it's business and it is what it is. Great for fashionable clothes."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Deserves Zero stars, but what can you do. They take months to deliver products even if they promise you a delivery within a certain time. I have never had a good experience with any purchase I made from Shein over the last few years. And when your order finally shows up (much later), you can be sure that it will not be as good as described. But even if you return your product, you'll never see your refund again. Even though on the app it says the refund happened. So yeah, don't waste your money"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing all around! I was skeptical at first seeing the ad on Facebook but I took the chance to make a purchase and I wasn't disappointed! It came, delivered properly, the quality was great.. The affordability, the style for bigger women and honesty are what attracted me to move ahead with my purchase. It's awesome!! It's great to read reviews on an item you are interested in, to make the right choices on size and such. I did a return and I had no problems. Everything ran smoothly. Love it!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Was having a lot of trouble at first but this site was very patient with me and helped me through it
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Products came on time, were well rapped and looked like the items shown on the store page But far far too small, I order everything in the largest possible sizes I could (so like 3XLs) for this exact issue because I know how these thing can go and they were still far too small, And I would consider myself a man of avarage weight. I would still give the app a go, but just try a t-shirt or something first to see if it'll fit you."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is easy to navigate and 99% of the products I've bought have been of spectacular quality! The inapp review option makes it easier for the Shein community to share their opinions regarding sizing and comfort of their purchases which means that every purchase can be an informed choice. There is also a seemingly endless array of options and unbelievably good prices!! To add to the great customer experience, orders often arrive earlier than predicted ♡"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app isn't terrible but it's not great. I wish they would find a way to stop showing duplicate items. It seems like they do this to make it look like they have more items than they do? I'm not sure. But scrolling and seeing the same item ( just a different color in the thumbnail) in different areas is frustrating. Other than that, I've never read issues with lagging or crashing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Lots of things seem nice and are cheap, but keep in mind that you run the risk of getting an item that is faulty/doesn't fit/arrives damaged and customer service is terrible. Kept trying to speak with a representative through live chat and kept getting automated responses. With better customer service this app could be something i use more often with confidence, for now be extremely wary."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,this app is useful.. it has different items that you can used at home at work and as well as at school....
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have only ordered from here once but it was a fairly big order. Shipping was fast! I was very impressed. Everything was packaged well and it all came together. It was good quality and just what I expected. I did have to return a few things due to size. Even returning items is hassle free. They even paid the postage to return it. I love browsing the website even if I dont buy anything.They have a lot of opportunities to get perks. I love Shein better than Wish!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"One thing I noticed as a new user is my unorganized wishlist, I'm someone who likes being organized, so a personal suggestion from someone like me is adding some sort of wishlist folder for the different categories, so when I finally decide to buy something, it'll be easier to find particular clothings, because when I browse for items, I match several clothings from different categories to create a full ootd set. But anyway, its still a 5 star from me because of the prices and clothing style."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great line of outfits for all ages.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love the Shein. I enjoy buying retro dresses from them. I don't like most of the styles that they have. But the products that I have bought have been good quality and very very reasonably priced. I do wish that they had more traditional clothing. I don't like a lot of the trendy stuff. Some people might but I would like more options of traditional things and retro things.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Best clothing app! I love all the aspects of this app along with the commerce side. You can opt to try out products for free and play little design games. Super fun and theyre always looking to improve. I'm still waiting for my first order to arrive so I dont know quite how the clothing fits but I'm thinking it will be a positive experience.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There's always a issue with trying to make a payment and y'all lied to me after inconveniencing me with cancelling my order. I was promised my orders will be prioritized and expedited. To date that didn't happened. Keep your promises and fix your faulty system. It also takes FOREVER to contact a live agent. That automated CSR is repetitive and annoying, there should be an option where we can get directly to an agent. Other than that products are great"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"They don't have good return process,if you return of items purchased together the system doesn't allow.All the items have to be returned if they are part of the order.Which is stupid.I purchased two dresses together and I wanted to return one of them due to size issues. I tried to but it was processing return all the items as they are purchased together. the quality is very poor n horrible material not worth the money."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"So good! Very good prices, the only online shop I actually trust ! The only reason for the 4 stars, is that I think there could be more variety in the models instead of white, skinny, curvy all the time. And there could also be a bigger variety of clothes for the kids, my daughter didn't like any of those clothes, as she is more of a ""kawaii"" style."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I Love Shein. I buy with intent to rewear and keep for a long time so I read reviews before buying because I don't like wasteful shopping. Sizing has been very consistent, shipping is pretty accurate, only ever had one delay and Covid had a lot to do with that. The products have been great quality for the price you pay and they have an amazing range of STYLISH clothes for both Plus size and standard size, they also have beautiful clothing items from different cultures which I think is great."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I had ordered a dress more than a week back and it has not been delivered yet. Now, the event for which I had ordered the dress is already over and the dress hasn't reached me. Can't tell about the product quality but the service is definitely the slowest. I regret trusting this App...for the very first time...I was unprepared for an event and the credit definitely goes to Shein. However, I admire the design of the dress...as seen in the picture but what is the use if the delivery is super slow."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Everything I've ordered from this app from adult clothing to kids clothing, jewellery, swim wear, cake supplies and accessories has been great quality and shipping super fast. Really impressed with Shein and the amazing variety is options of items offered. The only improvement for the app would be a better search function as the items pictures are often the descriptor and not the name. Overall functionality of the app is really good though."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"As soon as my package arrived in the mail, I went and tried them all on. I was very pleased with every single one. can't wait to really wear them out somewhere one day. I didn't get too many things since it was my first time purchasing, but I will for sure make bigger orders in the very near future. Maybe even until I have every item. I only gave 4 stars because I have only ordered once so far. This app made it easy to search and order. I was able to keep track of my order every step of the way."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's good but the packages come as if they have been thrown around every which way and sometimes stink, also do not order a lot of things at once and expect it to come fast, it will come most likely a month after. Other than that the products itself is good. Also the products plus tax are not cheap, the product itself is cheap but the tax makes you second guess buying what you want basically...they clickbait you."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Very disappointed with this app... I ordered $177 worth of merchandise and it got delivered to the wrong address. Not just the wrong address a whole different city. When putting in a request to get in contact with an agent it says it would take 24 hrs for them to get back with me... you have to wait for them to call or contact you. My shipping and billing information was all correct from the start of purchase... Now someone is enjoying my almost $200 dollar order... I've never heard of a company
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The prices are reasonable if you wait for a discount. The material of the clothes are generally quite good. The styles are are chic and trendy and there is something for everyone. Of course you need to compare prices with Amazon or other websites as well. Packaging can be better considering they charge shipping. Over all a good online store to shop from.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love SheIn. Have ordered several times even during Christmas season. Every order was prompt and correct with items .love the tracking system. Their products are really nice and well made. I've ordered things from clothes to household items and have not been disappointed. As for clothes they do come made to fit,true to size so if looking for a baggy style I would up a size . I also love the check-in points and games they have and their coupons are great too."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have never been disappointed. Matter of fact I have told multiple people about how amazing my purchases from Shein have been, while encouraging them to just check it out and try it themselves instead of taking my word for it. Regardless, I am absolutely addicted to purchasing clothing items, gifts, and any spooky or Halloween decor I can find. That's the only thing I wish they had more of it was Halloween decor. Otherwise I am one extremely happy 100% completely satisfied customer."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Idk about the other people but shein has way more stuff than Takealot even if it takes long to get hear it's pretty worth it because the quality is amazing i 100 present recommend this app
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this shopping app! They always have a great selection of items for everyone in my family. Even my husband who is really hard to shop for, loves when I order things off of this app for him. The prices are affordable, and the shipping is not bad either. I love the fact that when I get my items, I can post a review of them and earn points towards my next order. They also have the check in Daily feature to obtain points as well! Love love love SHEIN!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,every since I got this app I have been on it almost every single day and I can always find the clothing I want but the prices...There very expensive.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Everything is cheep, which is amazing! You can buy the same shirt from somewhere else and it will be 15 to 25 dollars while in this app you can buy it for 4 to 10 dollars. The pants on the other hand are a little more but other than that its awesome. Not to mention the coupons, I have only had this app for 2 days and I already have 3 coupons, there 10% off, 15% off, and the last one is 20% off. Its not that much but it can be helpful in some cases. This app is amazing!😇"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love shopping at Shein. I am a very busy mum and don't have all the time to go to the shops. But Shein made it so convenient for me to shop. The key thing here is to read reviews. I try to find for reviews with photos from buyers which have the same body frame as me so I will have an idea how it will look like on me. I find it easy to return the items as well as there are plenty of Parcel Points near my place for returning items. Returns are easy and no hustle at all.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I cannot think of one thing they need to improve. Their web page designer is doing everything right. Whoever is responsible for driving traffic to their page (and returning) is brilliant. As far as products, I spend more time looking at submitted customer pics than I do the model, it's just more realistic. Brilliant. The variety of products on this site is unparallel and I have found myself finding faults in various other webstores by comparison. Five stars indeed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After spending hours on shopping, at the checkout I saw a message saying shipping service not available for this address. When I visited to the specific product page and checked the pincode for delivery info, it said the pincode doesn't exist in India, which is bizarre because the pincode I entered is completely a valid one. PS: I live in a metro city in India. PPS: The in app feedback also doesn't work. I keep getting parameter error, even though I filled out ALL the necessary info."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I LOVE this app! I never review anything, but this app has surprised me on multiple levels. The items are always of better-than-expected material (much better than other cheap shopping apps), and they always look the like photos. They also frequently give out coupons, have flash and regular sales, and just by checking in, you can get free store credit. The fashion isn't always my taste, but I still find a lot of cute clothes for myself. Recommend for anyone!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the SheIn app. This site has the cutest clothes and fun contests to join, an interactive shopping experience at times, and the selection constantly upgrades as they have their own designers, so the keep up with trending. Plus the opportunity to become a featured designer is offered during contests, so this app presents an opportunity you can't find anywhere else! They also have stuff for your home, everyday use, jewelry, shoes, and accessories. One stop shopping. I send hours on SheIn."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Buyer beware. Bought a smart watch was sent a ugly analog mens watch. Customer service number rings busy. No way to get hold of anyone. Had to resort to getting my bank involved.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Their customer service is very slow and the do not even have clear instructions how to change shipping address the took long to deliver and not sorting out quick with parcels returned
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this app. Found swimsuits for my kids after the season when nobody local had them. Went by everyone's measurements and their suits fit great. Super low cost products that are great quality. Express shipping is affordable. Shipping is fast even without express shipping. Easy to navigate and find what I was looking for. I've ordered twice now and am very happy with my experience, I'm sure I'll order more. Definitely recommend"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Shein is my favorite app. Such a wide variety of shopping choices and all their products are excellent. I've had the app for almost 2 years and never received even one faulty product or order. The shipping schedule is accurate and when I have had to deal with customer service it's always been easy and productive.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Some products are good quality, others not so much. As a taller than average woman (5'8""), I find the clothes are too short. Would be really great if they had better quality (not see-through and no messy hems) clothes that were more professional-looking. Would also be easier to shop if they had more filter/search terms and if the terms were less vague. I guess, for the prices, you mostly get what you pay for."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The shopping is amazing but thier custom service it's what hit home for me I love it they will make sure that they update you and make sure that you get your products
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's a great app. But it takes other people desgins and don't give credit to the real owner of the product . Also the products are super cheap. but the problem still stand of taking others diegins and not giving credit to the real owner. If it was not about that problem it would be a 4or5 but it's a 3 because of the credit to the owners issue.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"shein gives you a ""lucky draw"" that makes you redeem rigged prizes that you need to invite someone else to the app to get your prize. and you also don't get your prize btw. shein is an awful, unethical company and should never be given money"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Exceptional! Beautiful styles at great prices. Shipping doesn't take as long as I expected it would. I've had a great experience using SheIn and I buy my clothes from here often. Also stuff for around the house, duvet cover sets, curtains, you name it. SheIn goes above and beyond and the choices are endless. I absolutely adore this app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have bought several dresses and tops at Shein. Everything I have gotten I have loved. I carefully read the measurements for each item I buy and read the reviews before I decide to buy it. So far, everything has fit me and looks just like the picture. I have gotten compliments on the clothes I have bought thru Shein.The prices are awesome. Everything was delivered so far on time or before. The only problem I have is missing where to apply the coupon."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really really love Shein. Its discounts, shipping deal, other ways to get points, its packaging, its good price, its fast shipping, its comment section where you can check for product's comments so you can have idea about the product and especially the sizing etc. Its just so perfect place to buy clothes. I kept recommending Shein to my friends and families."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I really like it they have a variety of things and great clothing. But the reason it doesn't have 5 stars is because the things you sometimes order don't look like they do in the images which can be bad. So I would look if they have photos of it on people (not the model). To see more of what it can/will look like on you. But other than that it's a pretty good clothing app definitely recommend.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I am trying to get into the return section of the app but it won't work. Most of the stuff I ordered needs to be returned as they were not true to size faulty or totally different than advertised? Can someone give me an email address so I can request a return label for my items. First time shopping with yous and don't want it to be the last.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My first time ordering was 1 month ago. I read bad reviews but I thought.. what the heck. So far I've made several orders, 7 to be exact.. they all arrive in 2 weeks or less and the app makes it easy to track. If you have any issues you can also contact an agent through support.. very good app!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Really awesome deals for some of the stuffs. The free shipping takes average 14 days to arrive so it's pretty good!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I sign up to your app for review clothes to earn money but can't get into it pay the free this must scam
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"There's so much to offer and low prices, nice given discounts, and even free Express shipping for an order $49.99 and more. If you want so nice clothes just get your measurements and you good. They even have more than just clothes. They have earrings, bracelets, necklaces, glasses, hats, caps, belts, pants chains, and more. I don't think you shouldn't at least give it a try."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Bought outfits few times from the app and I love it. Delivery is on time, usually arrive earlier than date stated. Material and quality is decent for the affordable price. There are varieties of outfit selections, with accessories. Remember to read the reviews of the product by other customers before buying. Sometimes actual size fitting may run big or smaller than specified. It is a good platform to purchase and try out different styles without burning your wallet."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,You steal my money I paid 27 pounds for an item I never received and my refund amount is incorrect I need my money back ASAP
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love the app, it's much easier to use than browsing through the webpage on my mobile. A feature for selecting what we DON'T want to see in the search would be helpful. There's a great amount of item/clothing types in the filter, but being able to specify 'no whatever' in the search results would help. I've used the filter system on both app & web, & you still get unwanted pieces that show up anyway. Had it change my order by number of product too (selected 1, had it changed to 3 unknowing etc.)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The SHEIN mobile app is a great way to stay up-to-date on the latest fashion trends and find the perfect outfit for any occasion. With over 20,000 styles to choose from, there's sure to be something for everyone. You can browse through the latest collections, or use the search bar to find what you're looking for faster. Plus, our easy checkout process makes shopping with SHEIN a breeze. Let the fun begin!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"At first, I really loved this app. But then my experience with the quality of the clothing went downhill quickly. I ordered some pants for work, and 2 out of the 3 pants I ordered had the hemming at the bottom of the legs completely lopsided. I'm considering ordering from the premium line, but as the prices for the NON premium clothing increase, I wonder if it'll be worth it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is my go-to shopping app, I have ordered several times and I have always received my products, of course some products have a higher quality than others, I've never had to return anything or ask for a refund, the prices vary and I find them affordable. The only thing I don't like is that once you pay you have to wait for 3 business days in order for the payment to reflect on your account and it usually takes about a month for my orders to arrive. Other than that, no complaints."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Used to be my favorite app for shopping but now there are very less variety of products for man . The delivery is very late . There is also this Problem of a line payment 😑 where u need to do some payment beforehand which is like a problem for me and many other people . This is like the last resort of shopping for me. Hope to see some changes in it 🙂. Thanks...
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Customer service is a very disappointment. I love the clothes, shoes, and nail supply but if I have a problem and your automatic system can't help I should be able to talk to someone over the phone. Then who cancel a order ticket over the holidays clearly I was busy and couldn't get back to y'all. Y'all love to take money but not give it back or fix the problem. I'm deleting the app today!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"App has been improved since i 1st got it. Your shopping cart is saved, can filter items by size and it will show you whats available and in your size. If you go to purchase whats in your cart but dont finish, your items are put into a pending purchase section leaving your cart open to start a seperate new cart with. And if you dont finish the pending purchase aka get through the payment information screen you have an option to re-add all items back to your new cart. Overall a good app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shein is a good shop but the system they use to corrier is too expensive, we're even scared to order but as for them They're recommendable."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"amazing, so handy. you would think that most of the clothes are cheap and rubbish materials for their price, but the materials are very good (the tops are really soft). all the little gadgets are helpful and they work really well. i totally recommend this app, not only for the materials and pricing but also for the reliable deliveries."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love their clothes, jewelry, & some of their shoes are very cute stylish & cheap! Customer service is amazing & there is no hassle with returns. They always have sales & discounts; and most of the time have free shipping. Points add up quickly with purchases & even opening the app to check in gets you points. (Great marketing strategy!) Very addictive. My number 1 place to shop for cute stylish clothes & accessories. They have it all.. LITERALLY."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is one of my most used apps for clothes and will continue to be that way. I originally heard of the app from my colleagues and heard about how great on prices the clothes were. So I decided to try it out and downloaded the app. I found so many great things ranging from swim wear, shirts, to jewelry. Great prices for everything, amazing quality, and cute clothes. I have made multiple purchases on the app and only had to return once. The return process was very smooth and helpful."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is the worst app I have come across. First of all they charge additional COD and Shipping Insurance charges. After that incase you wanna return the product you'll have to pay additional charges for your return. What's more, once you return your product you don't actually get a refund you just get the amount credited to their account that to after deducting charges. The products aren't even worth such hassle. Very bad quality and over priced. I'm never ever ordering from Shein again. Ever."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Easy with lots of choices. There are great prices and if you get something you don't end up liking, returning is really easy. I think that's an important quality because while you're pretty sure your like an item, once you try out on you'll know for certain, which means being able to return an item with little hassle is a selling point. I like the size estimator, too. If you answer the questions honestly, then the app will recommend a size that should fit."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I scroll through the app alot, but this was my first time ordering. it's very organized and easy to browse through. I like that it shows u similar suggestions to the one u picked. ordering process is very easy. I accidentally ordered two of the same item, and I was refunded the next day into my wallet. You can also see pictures and comments from the people who received their buys. and oh, I got great discounts too."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've been ordering from Shein for a long time through the app. I've never had any problems with an order and any returns I've made have been free and easy to do. I love that you can see what an item you want to buy looks like on someone as people can leave reviews and photos which is very helpful. Very happy All round .
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have order 7 ítem on the 28 of November 2023 ,they went out on delery on December 4 and now is january 23 and they still don't delivery as yet don't kno what is going on ."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"You definitely get what you pay for. Bottom line is the products are made with cheap materials. The designs and models look great, but the actual clothing isn't of the greatest quality. Jewelry wise it's in a similar boat - stainless steel. Honestly more durable than the clothes. Shoes are cheaper materials than the clothes but somehow stitched better. Overall it's not really worth it. Just a better version of Wish."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"ABSOLUTELY ADDICTED TO SHEIN!!! Love all the cute curvy styles at great prices! Plus, they have Afterpay as a payment option, so you can breakup purchases into four (4) installment payments over two months. Would be a 5 star rave review except the coloring on the app is very hit or miss. Have had several returns because color was off...e.g. what looks like royal purple 🟣 on app turns out to be magenta, or I wanted burnt orange/rust and it ended up being neon orange!😯"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like SHEIN, it has noce clothes, i think most of the prices are really good and the shipping cost is not bad, the things I've ordered get here before the date they give you which I really like, my only problem is that the material looks different on the models, some of the clothes look different in the picture and when they arrive they're a completely different material, some are really cheap and others really good, so it's kind of a gamble, but really good overall, not a bad app"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Customer service sucks sometimes. I've been trying to ask about my refund and it's nearly impossible to get ahold of a real person to answer my questions. It just tells me that customer service is busy and sends me back into a never ending loop with AI. The clothes are surprisingly good and everything is relatively cheap.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Ordered some items, it didn't take too long, but my expectations were ma aged well before hand. Actually items came earlier than expected. Quality of the dresses were good, much like h & m, new look, boohoo or miss guided. Fit better than h&m and simular to miss guided, however I did read all the reviews before deciding to order. Over very satisfied. However if I wanted what would be considered 'high end' quality I'd probably chose a different site."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a great app and plenty of nice clothes and stuff to choose from but sometimes it can be hit or miss especially with the sizes. You just have to know exactly what your sizes are or atleast the closest thing to but other than that it's quick and affordable. I've started completely changing my wardrobe with this app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This was a decent place to shop except that one small item was missing from my order. I submitted a ticket, and over two weeks later, when I asked for a follow up, they said that their investigation found there was no missing item, and if I frequently lied about missing items it would affect my account. I've heard from others that they've had the same thing happen. F*** you, Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love shopping on Shein. They have regular discounts and rewards on already low prices, and a lot of the things I have bought are really good quality. A couple were not as great as I hoped, but for the price it's well worth the chance! Just be sure to read the feedback before deciding. And shipping times are much faster than similar sites, usually only 1-2 weeks from overseas."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best online store for gothic/punk/awesome plus sized clothes I've ever used. Great prices, so often a sale and vouchers that allow for picking up some amazing things for an exceptional price. And even if the products come from overseas, delivery is more often than not accurate and quicker than sometimes expected. Overall, always pleased with this app/store!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My most top fav shop! Anything you need they have from winter, summer, spring, fall. From Athletics sportswear to sexy lingerie, the most unique beautiful dresses tops and bottoms skirts shorts jeans. What I love most is that everything is true to size, you will never go wrong on this site! Perks they even offer points and games to win extra points to shop!!!! I recommend this site 100% definitely a win, win that you must tell your friends about and get on this site and shop, shop, shop!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like the app, it's very easy to navigate. I have only ordered lingerie and a few kitchen accessories on here. You definitely get what you pay for. Not everything looks as good as it does on the model, except for the model that always has her mouth open, you know the one, if you look close enough you can see the serial number on her breast implants... That one 😆"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app, very affordable, fast shipping you can find anything on Shein, otherwise from that I hope the next update is we can contact the sellers if anything."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"honestly, this is an amazing app, its great. the sizing is very detailed which helps me because it's hard finding anything that fits me correctly! everything is in great shape and when it comes and the delivery times are accurate! you can even watch as its being delivered all across the U.S.! i love it and definitely recommend downloading it!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Never received items from your useless courier company - Buffalo Logistics.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein has amazing high quality fashion, at exceptionally low prices. Each item is clearly listed and accurately described. I like browsing through at my own pace, without a salesperson following me around. Take your time to answer questions about your size and measurements. It will help you figure out your size, so you can order the right sizes. You get a free return on each order, making it easy if you need to return something. I love Shein coupons and free shipping a low with minimum! ❤️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's an amazing app, you earn points from daily check ins which you can then get discounts off of purchases. Some of the clothes are actually so pretty and good material, shipping is fast and it's a very easy app/website to use. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because some material is really thin and bad, some clothes don't look like the picture but that's usually not the case. I suggest you look at reviews and photos of the clothes you want so you can see what it really looks like."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The clothes are great for the most part. The sizing is kinda erratic, and the size listed in the descriptions aren't accurate. The point system is good but I got started over at one point 3 times when I know I checked in. The prices are amazing and the shipping time is great. Most fabrics are good quality and wash really well."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Some of the clothes are really great, but the return process is a joke. You pay for shipping (sometimes) to get it to you, but then when literally everything you bought doesn't fit, you pay shipping to send back. And on top of all of that they credit you a portion of what you spent originally regardless of the fact that you've already spent over $200. SHEIN really would be the BEST thing without all of the corner cutting at the customer's expense."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app, easy to use and so far I have gotten high quality items for good prices. The only thing I would like to see in the future is maybe more color options for more clothing pieces? There have been several times where I really love the design of something but the color just wouldn't work for me. Otherwise amazing service I recommend trying it out"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I LOVE this app! Just about every pay day I'm stacking my shopping bag, lol because the clothes are just so cute and you can't find these kinds of things for this price at a brick and mortar. As for the app performance itself it's fast, easy to use and there's lots of short cuts to get to where you want to go. And the customer service is pretty good as well. It's set up as if your texting back and fourth."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,BEWARE. WARNING!! NOTHING IS FREE. IF YOU GET FREE PRIZES YOU HAVE TO RELY ON BEGGING 5 FRIENDS TO JOIN AND BUY. READ THE SMALL PRINT. I WILL STICK WITH SITES THAT ARE HONEST WITH OFFERS. THIS SITE NEEDS INVESTIGATING FOR IT'S UNETHICAL METHODS
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Always buy here every month new parcels came in best condition different sellers here low prices high quality not a scam!! Sometimes things a but smaller so Check size before
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Really not a good idea... The clothes are a good price but the chances of getting the correct size are really low. I've ordered all different sizes and they fit me differently each time. The app itself has annoying notifications all the time and they do that thing where everything is ON SALE BUT ONLY RIGHT NOW BUY BUY BUY like every three hours. They only ever post my positive product reviews. The prices just aren't low enough to equate for the problems and quality of materials.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The best shopping app's .. easy to use and so useful.. thank u Shein ❤️
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good deals! Fit is a hit or miss but refunds are easy. I just have one issue with this and its that my registration with all my points history, vouchers, reviews etc still works on my old phone but is completely a blank slate on my new phone. Email on new phone appears as a new registration (same email). Why don't points just carry over when I log in on a new phone? I lost all my valuable accumulated points this year. So disappointed in this from an otherwise great app. please fix this asap."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Shein doesn't even earn 1 star but I have to put something out here to warn everyone. Their customer service doesn't exist, it's all bots. If you have a problem, you won't receive help. An example of the stupidity of this app, if you enter your email address & it's saved wrong, you can't correct it. Your order will stall bcuz you cant confirm the email they send to the wrong address. They'll tell you to cancel ur acct but they request you enter a code that they will send..to ur WRONG email!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"great app! the adds aren't annoying and their relevent to what your looking at! there's competitions to get involved with and endless clothing items and accessories to browse at! I really love how fast the delivery is and hoe good quality everything is, I really enjoyed using the app as it is so well organized and I can find what I'm looking for a lot faster than in other apps of clothing. keep up the great work shein team!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Every time the app shows dresses in between my game tried many times to find a certain dress and I cannot get it or find it in your app
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,To many emails (up to 6 or more a day) and at all hours of the day and night. I had to turn my notifications volume down as received notifications at 1:00 a.m. 4:00 a.m. not including the ones during the day. The other issue is to many trackers (sell you info). Clothes are nice for the most part. Takes longer to get them becauce they come from out of the country.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shipping is usually very fast. And clothes are pretty much exactly what you see on the pictures. My only issue is the sizes tend to be either too small or too big and to make sure things fit I have to use a measuring tape and order based on measurements rather than a standard s,m,l size format. But otherwise an amazing place to order clothes"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very fast delivery, most of the products (I bought) are very good! Only downside is the amount of emails I receive in general from shein, yes I understand it is for offers and marketing purposes but when I am trying to save money it is like a little devil sitting on my shoulder saying you have to do some shoppingggg hahaha!! Overall a good experience though"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,How sad that the max. Points that can only use is 30% so need to uninstall the app since its no longer useful and I can't order since the product is expensive.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love love love this app it has quality clothing at affordable prices! It's completely changed my shopping experience! I've used this app regularly and not broke the bank! It always arrives before the scheduled delivery time too. I've not had a bad thing from shein yet! You also get massive discounts, points for pennies off! And review to earn extra points! Win win for me couldn't recommend it more!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I originally heard about SHEIN through a friend of mine & shortly after I noticed a couple of ads while scrolling through FB... I REALLY liked what I saw & so I JUST downloaded the app yestersay. There seem to be SO MANY wicked nice pieces at GREAT prices that at this point, I've already picked out 45 items that I NOW must narrow down to 2! Having such an AWESOME, AFFORDABLE collection of clothing available for simple & convenient on-line purchasing at home is AMAZING! 😊"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely love shein, the clothes that I have bought is such great quality especially for the prices. Sports leggings are my favourite. So many clothes to choose from. They make it so easy to return stuff. It really helps too with the customer reviews so you know the sizing of each product you buy. The discounts are also great. Thanks shein, I haven't been into a shop to buy anything since covid started and I dont actually miss it. Shein has definitely filled up my wardrobe and I'm loving it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"All Shopping Done Here!! I'm pretty sure they sell everything on this site, well all except for food, and all for cheap. Crazy I can get a full outfit for less than $20. My last purchase I bought 96 items for $320. Not sure where else you can go for that. I love the clothes, shoes, lingerie, makeup, wall art & kitchen utensils. So far I've ordered on here about 5 times, each time I got at least 50 items, & I've only had to return 5 things and all of those were due to not ordering the right size."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best clothes buying app I've found. Fast! don't have to wait forever for the pics to load, easy to navigate, lots of categories. Actual measurements as in inches are included with each description...love that!! Content is updated often! Daily sales. Filtering and sorting options are fantastic, just wish all filters were available for all categories. highly recommend using this app. it's addictive, you've been warned."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I think Shein is incredible they release new items almost or everyday and if you buy 10 items you can pay with cash on delivery. And you can wishlist items you might want to buy next time. You are also able to collect coupons and points to decrease your total price, they have so many sales, collections and all the product are already a good price."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is decent. The biggest annoyance is every time you open the app, there's an ad. The other things I dislike is you cannot filter clothes by the color black or by the material. The website version offers more filter options. You can't submit a ticket via the app. The response is misleading. You have to call them and I don't have time to do so."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this place. My only issue is, prices change. I notice the same shirt but in a different color the prices change. I don't think that's far at all. I also placed an order, had stuff in my cart, then removed q few items I didnt want at the time and then hit checkout and realized the items were not removed. I had already paid. That sucked. But I do love sheen. Would love a discount code. I had some a none worked."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"App itself is great! Many products are not the best quality, you get what you pay for as they say, but if you look through reviews and know your size it makes buying a lot easier. There's a plethora of categories to shop in and I've had surprisingly good lucky with the sunglasses I've purchased; if the glasses dont work out each case I've gotten has been ++quality I typically use for travel/beach. Again, great app but be sure to check your reviews! Not the best for impulsive shoppers ;)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Played the games it said I would get back one coin for new app user. I had to new app user and very much got back .08 of a coin. If I would have got back the whole coin I would have received reward as game stated.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app and company sucks. It saved my old address so I changed it and placed an order. I looked at the order and it still had my old address. Tried to cancell but they wouldn't let me, still charged me, and won't accept a return bc I don't have the item (bc they sent it to the wrong address!) Tried to contact support, they don't have a number and the chat refuses to connect you with an agent."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have only good things to say about Shein. When I order everything comes within the stated delivery time and it just as described. But make sure to ALWAYS look at the measurements of the clothes because the models look the same in pictures but in reality it all varies. If you don't like something it is simple to return it and you get most of your money back. I have many dresses from here and will be purchasing more! Good luck and God bless. ❤
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"My experience with Shein has been positive overall. Except for two things, firstly a delivery got delayed but I was partially responsible for the delay as I paid the taxes later than I usually do. Another thing that would be that most of the clothes here pants to more specific don't have an extra small size which often results in me having to pay for alterations. Which kinda defeats the whole purpose of me wanting to purchase clothes here for their affordability. However the clothes are amazing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"BRILL APP Items are very well made and fabrics are mostly excellent quality for the price you're paying, ESPECIALLY some of the offers! As I'm a couple of sizes larger than a model the plus size range is fabulous! Despatch speed great in comparison to other Eastern online stores. Always well wrapped and boxed. One great difference is the loyalty points scheme, for which you have to 1) check-in every day, points = pennies! 2) Confirm delivery, add pics & reviews items for points too!👍🥰"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am never disappointed, I receive everything in a timely fashion, everything is great when I get it and exactly what I expected. The one time in the last 2 years I've had to return something, it was extremely easy and they even allowed me to keep the item. I highly recommend shein, I am a big girl and they make clothes, lingerie, swimsuits, and all kinds of goodies that are flattering to my body type!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"App is great, no issues. Haven't ever had a freeze incident. Easy to shop on the site. Shein has almost everything that can be imagined for prices you won't believe. Free shipping always and express ship with minimum purchases. Items tend to sell quickly so shop now. Contests, giveaways, and coupons keep it extra fun."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Frustrating. You get points, you can't use them all, and if you don't use them all, they disappear. You can try to earn credit by inviting someone, but good luck unless you have 20 friends who don't have shien. Everything is cheap because it's a REALLY small amount of something or it's not the greatest material. There are some good things, but you have to work to find the right size because the suggestions are not accurate."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the app! And most of sheins items are so affordable! I can't wait for my very first order to show up tomorrow! I also love the option to try free trails and how it helps you earn more points when you leave a review! I'm so excited about whether or not I won my chance to get a free trial! Though the some items won't load so I can't get a closer look at it, but it's the only problem so far I've come across and that only happened recently."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I really like shein because it has a wide variety of things to choose from as well as multiple colors. Its straight to the point shopping. However I realised that there isn't an option to become a brand ambassador also there are no frequent discount codes available so if that could be fixed it would be great.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I placed an order or around $85 and it got lost in transit. After two months trying to contact Shein, FedEx and the third party that sold through SheIn. All Shein said was sorry it got lost, here is 50 points. Do not use Shein"

The alert box that is being shown while choosing the cellular data to continue. If by mistake we we click outside it then a error code is thrown while writing the comment and also continuously shown when we click on the try it again . Please check . Regards, Sobhini Reddy"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This site has so many options and I love shopping here. However it would be better if there was links to the other items the models are wearing. For example if I'm looking at a dress it'll be helpful if I could easily find the shoes or top being shown with it :)
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app deserves 10/10 stars it's my favorite it has absolutely everything good quality low price and fast shipping! It has so many discounts and coupons to apply as well and my favorite part is the app has a section called ""gals"" to design your own unique style outfit as a friendly compention and all the ladies do a great job at supporting other stylist i love it so much !!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've never commented on apps but for Shein, I would. When I was first introduced to Shein, I thought the cut, quality and selection wont be good given how affordable the things are but I was so wrong! Shein has completely changed my life! Shein makes fashion fun, affordable and so many choices! Would be great if shipping is faster though. Right now it takes about 2 weeks to receive my order. If that could be cut down to 1 week, it would be fantastic!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Good store but blows up app notifications with messages. For the past week or so they send an email or app notification every 20 minutes for some sale. I've had the app since early this year and never noticed it quite like now. Looking inside to reduce the number of notifications they send, but I've settled on turning off all notifications in phone app settings. 2 AM and woke up to use the bathroom - had over 30 notifications they've sent since I fell asleep. I stopped counting at 30."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I 💜 this site!!! Products SO FAR have been of nice material, great quality, and look exactly as pictured. Customer service is great and the prices are reasonable for what you are receiving ( if not a steal). I do understand that this is a site of hit or miss.. So really take your time picking out what you want. Zoom in, look at the fabric, check out the garment in the different colors it comes in (lighter colors tell the truth), and check the reviews some buyers leave pic of product IRL."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is one of my go to shopping apps for almost anything at this point. Great prices, great coupons, and lots of reviews on products to make sure you get exactly what you want. They also have contests for points/discounts, a social community, and an ever expanding product market. They have everything from clothes, jewelry, home goods, cosmetics, storage, intimates, they even just added pet stuff!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I understand having models of all cultures but when I look for kids clothes all I see are black models! I want to see some white kids too! This is very one sided & as a white person I feel discrimination against white kids going on. For this reason I will not shop here!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Fashion ok... No Customer Service it's a NO GO They have good and cheap stuff, also they have automated responses to questions. My package got lost, and FedEx contacted me to tell me it is lost. SHEIN has no personnel, email, or number where to reach them to make a claim for the lost items, and the bot is not able to answer. But they do have a ""policy"" that prevents you from claiming lost items after a certain time. How can you make a claim if there's no one to get it from."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The most reliable online company from China. I order regularly and if I have any issue the customer service always helps with a very nice manner! If I don't like something simply send it back. Also they have good sales, points, and gift cards. I live shein! ( however no idea about the correct pronunciation haha 😁)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm obsessed with this app, the clothes are usually good quality, tons and tons of options, and everything I've bought (over 20 items in my first month) fit true to size! My bank (us) charges an extra international processing fee when my paypal goes through, just heads up. Happy shopping and shipping experiences for me. 2/9/21 used this app pretty much every day still love it!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have had an amazing experience with this app and store. The clothes are amazingly priced at great quality, and on top of that I've gotten some of the best customer service. I had an item missing so I contacted support. They asked for a return label and I didn't have it, but they still went ahead and helped me by either giving me a refund or reshipping it. The person I talked to was Marcus, I meant to rate his service but it won't let me. If you ever get help from him please rate him good. :)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Shein products are great material from clothes to watches and earrings. I order from the app every week and I love that you can use coupons every purchase and the points gained from leaving reviews are good too. The only 2 things I want them to improve is 1) more fashionable and nicer clothes for plus sizes and 2) for delivery time to be faster.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Addictive! I literally spend hours going through the site and adding bits to my wish list or basket. They do some amazing offers and to be honest, it's probably my main shop for clothes now. The only thing that slightly let's it down for me is the delivery time, I'm so impulsive I want things now, but it can take about 10 days to arrive. But when it does it's like Christmas!! Good quality and such reasonable prices on things!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"My first order was a nightmare, I received my shipment way after the estimated delivery time - with no updates on the tracking sites. The second one got delivered within 10days which was way before the delivery date...That was highly impressive. The last point I would like to make is your returning of items - the process is rather difficult or unclear. As a matter of fact I'm stuck with two pairs of shoes that does not fit. I still don't know how to return them..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I used to buy clothes on shein and 1 time I changed my payment plan and used the pay later method wow and later on on they sent me letters with the account l was supposed to put money in. I did that money was bouncing back to my account and it happened several times. To my surprise they sent letters from debt collectors with huge amounts of money. I tried to contact them but no avail or action I ended up paying triple the original amount of the orders. What a bad experience I had
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Alright, I was sceptical at first. Until I took the time to look at every little detail & read the reviews. I got hooked looking at all the items. So easy to navigate through the app & the website. Now after days at playing with the app & realizing the price doesn't change once put in your cart like the app WISH I decided to get my first order. I chose 4 items, 2 blouses & 2 kitchen gadgets. It took less then 2 weeks to get them. WAY quicker then WISH. This is my go to clothing app! A must try!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The shop is great. Lovely items and they don't take long to ship. But...there is no way to change the language options. My phone is set for English, all other apps that I use are set for English, but as I live in Portugal SHEIN is in Portuguese and a very bad and incorrect Portuguese that makes using the search option almost impossible. Very frustrating. And yes, I did contact customer service, but not only did they respond in Portuguese but also the answer is basically option not yet available"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shipping is great, quality is great, and prices are even better! They always have some kind of deal or coupon which is so awesome, and the deliveries are pretty quick. The wishlists makes life so much easier and if it goes out stock while in your wishlist it'll update you when it's back in stock. 5/5 Recommend!"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Anyone that gives this app negative reviews obviously doesn't know how to use a basic app. Everything is super easy. I've returned stuff a few times with no problems. I love all of their products and customer service is great if you need help or have any issues. I love everything I have gotten from them and buy stuff all the time. They always have coupons and great deals. Definitely at least give it a try if you never have.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I like the coupons although sometimes i forget to use them and the the returns are trouble free. I am also a bigger girl I am able to find stuff that fits which is super important. And i like that you can buy small quantity of the misc Items. The shipping is fast for being so far away . and i love the individual packaging cuase i can re-use the bags. And they have interesting gadgets that i never seen before.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall good experience. Some clothes are on the cheaper side but you get what you pay for. I find it a bit more difficult with sizing and have not done a return as yet. I love the styles and trendy plus size options. Never had issues not receiving a package, and I was surprised how fast some packages came."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Terrible, trying to return a kitchen rack that fits over microwave, WITHOUT SUCCESS, PUT ORDER NO IN, KEEPS BRINGING UP SOMETHING ELSE. 😬😬😬"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is absolutely my go to app for affordable clothes. Everything is very affordable, there's always sales and discounts, and I looove the variety of products they have. I'm able to buy makeup, clothes, dog toys and home decor stuff in one place. There's lots of incentive to buy and leave honest reviews, you get points and more opportunities for discounts and such. Everything is actually great quality and the variety is endless. Highly recommend!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Shien is personally my favorite out of all the low price shopping websites. I definitely prefer this over temu as it also doesn't have rumors of stealing information. The products always come as listed and the price doesn't change upon checkout and it does actually give free shipping for anything over $30. I also just really enjoy scrolling and finding flash sales as i could buy alot for a little well getting good stuff. Always remember to check the reviews on both shipping and quality though.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"it frustrates me that i can't even redeem all my points at once now. i've been saving it up for months just to be able to buy the shoes i have been eyeing on. suddenly, when i tried checking out the item, only 500 of the 1k points that i meticulously worked hard on saving can be redeemed. PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD WAYS. while most of your consumers have money to buy such expensive products from your site, i hope you also realize that you need to give attention to the ones like me who can't. pls"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I used to shop on this app because it's perfect you could get a nice OOTD but please bring back the 70% I can't use all my points it has maximum.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The notifications are pretty obnoxious honestly.. it's a great little app don't get me wrong, but the amount of notifications this app sends, even when I turn them off & block them, somehow in my drop down menu there they are again shortly after I use the app every single time for days & days & days on end till the next time I go into the app & attempt to turn them off again. Haven't purchased anything from the app yet, as it's almost a too good to be true type of app, but it looks alright."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Almost every item I have ordered has been sewn crooked, unevenly hemmed, zippers are poorly inserted in stuff, sizes are smaller than described, just always something. I don't have time to go thru their lengthy drawn out return process, so I either fix it or trash it. I place quite large orders of at least $400 at a time, so I expect to get what I pay for. 1 out of every 12 items arrive and are flawless, but that's not good enuff for me. Don't shop here. And no u don't do jack to fix it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Super inexpensive stuff. Obviously the quality is pretty cheap but that's expected. I mostly buy craft supplies so cheap is best tbh. I have 2 pairs of shoes and I was actually surprised at how sturdy they are and how well they've held up for such a cheap price. Only down side is the clothes and finding the right size. Sizing is inconsistent but ALL companies are like that with plus sizes so it's nothing new to me.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Slow delivery, but worth it for the huge variety of fashion, home and beauty. Ok quality, perfect for staying in style with fast fashion trends. Items will last the season at least. Something for every style and occasion. App is very easy to use. Always discounts available."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"From stylish denim jeans to breezy capris, this app satisfies my clothing needs. I love baggy clothing, but certain brands XL/XXL fit like a US medium. The shoes fit perfectly (EU44/45). Wallets, socks, underwear, and accessories come as advertised. Plushies are a hit or miss. Overall, I trust this app to bring me high-quality fashion that suits my taste. Every outfit I wear has gotten positive comments and questions. I am proud to advertise the duality and diversity of Shein's selection. (25M)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I know I sound cheap, but I just wanna ask something about bonus points. Since the point deduction changed into 30% off of the subtotal. It was 70% off before. I was wondering if it's permanent or is it just because of black friday? I've been using this app for almost 2 years now and using points helped me save money. Hope you notice this. I tried to ask costumers service, but they are giving me unrelated answers. Thank you."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Items don't ship. I have to be tracking it from the day it ships and it's so hard to get an actual agent vs a bot. I want the outfits I buy not my refund. It's so annoying. The clothing when and if I do get it are super cute but the fact that they have horrible shipping and handling makes it impossible to use. Really sucks because I love the outfits.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Most of the time I love Shien but I hate it when a fabric is totally see through and skirts and dresses could all do with a slightly longer hem length. Particularly on children's clothes. Also young teens wear the women's. But the choice of clothes and trend is Fantastic. I love the colors, styles and accessories. Customer service is excellent to put right any mistakes. Posting is always reasonable."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm in college and I have a very tight budget and i live in a rural area that doesn't have many stores. It's great to be able to find different things to mix and match thats actually affordable. Surprisingly, the qeuality Is better than some of the stuff I pay $30+ for off Amazon. Plus, everything I've bought so far has held up great (but im also pretty gentle with everything)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is great, it contains many different things you can buy. But for some reason I cannot seem to find the ""my reference"" button anywhere on the app and on the website. I have tried refreshing the app, restarting the app and I have tried clearing out the cache but it still won't show up, it might just be a bug/error but can you please fix it Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Returns are not possible. One of the shirts (1 out of 7 items I bought) did not fit. They asked me to return via international shipping to HK (from Thailand) which I had to pay and the cost of sending this is more than the cost of the product itself. I would think twice before ordering again. Strange process. Edit : yes, this is the feedback from your support team. Simply disappointing in today's day and age to have such outdated practice for return!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm a little disappointed with some of the changes. First, I can no longer see the upcoming products that will be on flash sale, second is they limited the points usage, now points can be used up to 30% of total price of the product. Update: Coupons are not working anymore, it will just say that it's not applicable on the order or site not valid."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I spent the whole day filling my cart but forgot to log in and the next minute everything was gone, what a waste of time. I was battling to find a suitable payment option and on going back to try again, every item was gone. I don't have paypal and I refuse to put my card details on any site, no Payfast, EFT etc option. So disappointed"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Really great shopping experience. improvements needed: reviews of products with just emojis or a bunch of nonsense that has nothing to do with the product - these should be reported and reviewers shouldn't be receiving points for that! When going to the payment, one should be able to ADD products, not just pay right away without going back to the shopping cart to add something, this is very frustrating. Clothing items are hard to find - inaccurate descriptions. Review Points should NOT EXPIRE."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's not affordable anymore. The prices are double compared to shoppee but you can lessen the price using your points. But now the points you can apply is reduced and limited. Shipping is also long. I'm transferring to shoppee it's more cheaper there, their quality is just the same."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A pretty decent clothing app. There could definitely be improvements though. For instance: not limiting how many boards can be made, not limiting how many items can be added to boards, having free shipping for orders $9.9+ like it used to be, awarding more points for checking in, etc"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love the clothing and affordable prices.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Had this app for the longest time (2yrs+) and ordered hundreds of times which are good products. I'm giving this one star as they took my credits balance worth $500 from my shein wallet and they won't give it to me back no matter how many times I contacted them. They also don't give refunds back. I had one order cancelled and says refunded but the credits doesn't show up on my wallet. Their customer support are the worst.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Account was hacked. There's no one that can be contacted about my concerns. Items were ordered in my name and sent to Miami FL and I live in Los Angeles California. Nothing was reported to me through email until the items arrived for pickup in Miami. Everyone warned me about Shein but I didn't want to listen. Can't trust no one. I hate them now. I deactivated my account and deleted the app. Stick with Amazon, a company that CAN be trusted!!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,At this point I haven't purchased anything. I have my 3 items in the basket ready to go. One of the dresses went up in price so hoping it drops again by the time I'm ready to pay. Lots of lovely dresses to choose from. And the reviews of the ones I have chosen sound good. Hope I get a lovely dress for a wedding im attending. I'll write a better review when I receive my items.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I think they need to do well with the product they market.. I placed an order and almost everything they delivered what out of quality,even to return it became a problem as nobody is calling me why I wanted to return the items I bought.. you need to do well in your customers service, and put an email someone can use to reach your office. I regret spending my money on your app"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I ordered a package, but it never got delivered 😴 Says ""item delayed"" whenever I check, but I never got an notification that my items would be delayed😴"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is very simple to use and prices are great. I'm buying things for the whole family weekly. Clothes are comfortable and fit just right. Any problems or unwanted items are delt with quickly and easily. Don't know about too many other apps like this one but you'll have no complaints using SHEIN. I'd recommend it to everyone. Very few adds to have to deal with also. Barely any at all which is a deal maker for me.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The discount that you can get when you use your points is only maximum at 30% of the product, and it's over all applied in all the product that you want to pay, unlikely the past months that the maximum use of the points is where you just only need to pay the 5 or 6 dollars for you to use the points, this app wants you to spend more this time, though their product is only made in cheap materials"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Their sizing is horrible. They say plus size but they really mean normal sizes. Their 5x is a 20/22 but fits like a 16. I know. You get what you pay for, but they're advertising is misleading. So until their 5x is truly a 26/28 and fits like it, I won't be redownloading or recommending to anyone I know. Update: I did refer to the size chart. It's a lie. Your sizes aren't true sizes! So try again Shein!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Brilliant & easy to use thanks to the search function, filters, recommendations, reviews with pictures etc. There are tons of items often very cheap but the quality isn't always good. I suggest you read the description (honest about materials etc), size guide and reviews before purchase for the best deal as the pics or title can be deceiving. No ads. Coupons, points & seasonal prizes can be won. PS** shipping & refunds can be difficult depending on the logistics company SHEIN chooses."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Worst experience ever. Bought 2 products and had to return both of them immediately and had to go through a lot of hustle, shein has a very bad customer service system had to waiting for 15-20 days for my refund.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shein is a great app and has lots of nice things although the shipping does take a long time if you are in the US imsince they are situated in China. But other than that everything they sell is quite nice and there are a lot of products, from clothes, to kitchen gadgets, to room decor, it has it all! Ps. I recommend only buying things from Shein if you have enough money because only thing just isn't enough!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Actually it's great, it has cheap prices and you'll automatically get a free shipping once your order reached 249.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The quality of the photos are bad! Most orders feel like a shot in the dark... The app overall is good, delivery is trustworthy and returns are easy.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"In 2021 my review was: “Best online shopping experience ever.” Today, in December 2023, I am editing the review because I am very disappointed. I see the low quality of the items, everything is made of polyester, no cotton, and the design is bad. Additionally, they increased the purchase amount eligible for free shipping from $40 to $400. It's crazy."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used to love shopping in this app not until the recent update. Before, I could use all of the check-in points I gathered in one shopping and now, suddenly, i am limited to only use 30% of it which is really disappointing. Instead of upgrading the service, that's more like a downgrade."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I'm not going to star this app only because I actually have not ordered nothing off of the app. They do got some really cute clothes and I'm sure they're a lot more reasonable than in the store. But for me, I think the prices are a little high and there's not a big enough discount though. Somebody that I didn't know. We started a conversation and they were telling me that this specific app has real good quality clothes for cheap and the size that they say they are, they are and the what you orde"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very fast delivery. Simple return process and fast refund (in America market, outside the US the return may cost fee and time). Almost all the products size are true to description, however the reviews are not really correct corresponding to my body type. But that's something objective. Overall, nice offers with competitive prices, various products and fast delivery."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I withdrew my wallet amount to my original payment account but it's not credited to my account, I submitted issue ticket in this app many times but they didn't take any necessary steps for it. Every time they close the ticket without any problem solving. They didn't have costumer care number to call also. My refund amount is stucked in their account for above 1 month"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy ordering from the app. However, a new feature is really making me not want to use the app. The feature is the pop up that shows after adding something to my wishlist and gets in the way of what I'm doing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Got my first order about 2 weeks after purchasing. Product came nice and neat, exactly as described. However as I kept looking through the site, I see that everything is polyester. I don't really want that cool shiny fabric on all my clothes. Now that it's fall, I would like warmer materials. Overall it's decent, just not for everything."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Fashionable and really good value. I've had some beautiful summer dresses from this site as well as tried some bits i wouldn't normally wear because they've been so reasonable. The site is good but the filters could be a little better but not by much. They have a nice range of unusual items and also a really good amount of curvy and plus size clothing. Love it!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"hi lately sheins payment calculation is wrong. my initial total payment to be made is 3100. after clicking checkout , the system is adding the supposed 600 off from my initial total amount and then offsetting it with 600 discount. in reality, we are not having any discount at all. shein was nice before but then i think your misleading your customers into believing we are receiving ""discounts"" when in fact we are not."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, it's the most interactive and interesting shopping app that I've ever used. With it's live shows, and things like games such as Guess the Price of this outfit and so, so much more (win points to get money off your order). Seriously if you love shopping they've got great quality for the price and something for everyone! Download it, you won't regret it!!!! So what are you waiting for download it already!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"All the clothes on there are very nice and I really like them until I found out they use 20 times as much lead in little kids clothing and other chemicals we should bot be wearing in our clothes and the materials are very cheap and ruins quickly, that's why the clothes are around 10 dollars, some of my shirts are either fading or cracking and I have a sweater I never wore from here and the bottom is already white and crunchy kind of hard like the colors faded, dont recommend shopping here"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I really shein like before but not now it has changed because it's not free shipping when 6-8pm also its limited for clothes only. its also getting expensive too.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is sò easy to navigate. I was very sceptical about the quality of the clothing but I was wrong. Every item I have ordered has been good quality fabric. Take the time to take your measurements, hover over the sizes, and pick the correct size for you. There are styles that you would not get in the shops. The choices are mind boggling. I'll be back again and again! Thank you Shein team for your hard work to get the orders out! You're the best!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have not been one to do much online cloth shopping but my experience with Shein has been good. Most of the clothing I have purchased fits well and are of good quality. Fashionable and affordable options in clothing. They offer free shipping over $60 and over $120+ free express shipping. With the free express shipping you will have to pay duty charges on your purchases. Easy returns and exchanges. Refunds are prompt. Various payment options available. I will continue shopping with them.👌🏾
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible company. Made two transactions and both were stopped by the Fraud Team. They demanded loads different documents from me to prove I was a legitimate customer, which I did. Regardless, they just kept on. We reached an impasse. I decided it was easier to simply ask them to refund my transactions and delete my account. They only refunded one, and I'm now left chasing the second one. Don't bother, it's an absolute waste of time..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I would like to express my disappointment about the recent update... I am really a big user of shein because of huge discounts but now you can't even use your maximum points which you collected EVERYDAY. I mean what's the use of collecting points when you can't use all of it?! I'm very disappointed and I wish that it will go back the same way as before. It's very upsetting to rate this app 1 star but maybe rating it like this will make you see my review. Ciao!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best shopping experience! I'm obsessed 😍 No nonsense, what you see is what you get. The quality is top notch, prices are affordable. You probably heard a lot of things about Shein, they are a sustainable company, too bad for the competition coz no other platform has the quality and variety. Even my hubby is impressed and he's fussy. So well done Shein, and thank you for bringing sexy back! 🤣 much love from ZA 🇿🇦 ❤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is the worst place to shop from!!, if they dont recognize your card the block you without warning and take the money inside your wallet and when you reach out to there customer service they close all tickets without answering and when they do answer they lie about account will open in 2 days after you have explained that yes the card is for a realitive and that you did nothing wrong. They also tell you to wait 60-100 days to get whats in your wallet!! I LOVE SHOPPING BUT THIS IS THE WORST!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"GREAT APP! ❤️ And I really love SHEIN over all. I've been ordering A LOT of clothes and accessories for me (and my son) and I've never had a problem. Delivery is always early, sizing is accurate, prices are amazing. The system they've come up with where you earn points (that you can actually use to shop) for reviews is fantastic, you can easily find good quality items with pictures. Fun extras like holiday sales lottery, styling contests and more makes the whole experience even better!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I want to complain about the limit in points like what you mean the original price is 800+, I'm trying to use my points and for some reason it is being limit like I have 600 points; you only want me to use freaking 400 points it didn't lessen it much. Also, the free shipping every weekends are gone. Why? Being petty SHEIN! I thought of this app as great on the start but now it's just being unreasonable for all this changes."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Decided to choose a side in a political conflict. Decided to choose the inhumane side. Also, cheap clothes, not as described in the app. Can't get an actual invoice, it's a big headache which makes you just giving up on it even if you do need it. Idk why they decided to talk politics when it's a fashion app. Very disappointed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I placed my order and after a few minutes I canceled it. They didn't give back my money. I'm sorry for this review but I hope you'll fix this bug. Have a nice day!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely loved this app until I started getting some items that fit like a crop top despite the photos a s descriptions provided. I also got the shock of my life when half my check in points expired! I had no idea they would, I was trying to save up for my next purchase but I went from 1400 to about 800 points over night."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I gave it a 5 put of 5 because it truly is one of the most easy and convenient apps I have ever used. Makes the online shopping experience very exciting to the point where I'll be scrolling for hours and hours because there are so many things to choose from. I really like how there is a ""points"" system where you can earn points by ""checking in"" every day, and you are then able to use those points to reduce the price of your orders. I also really love how you can literally find anything you want"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I do really like shein, I'm able to buy my own clothes for cheap without anyone knowing when it where I get it. I'm not the most rich person either, and majority of the items on shein are very good quality, or the quality is fixable for cheaper than the more expensive product elsewhere. There are no apps too, and frequent 'games' to help you earn points to make purchases even cheaper. Shipping is only £/$/€2 And normally arrives within 2 weeks"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love all my purchases! My deliveries have always been on time and sometimes even earlier. The Shein app is very well thought out and easy to use. Being able to view information on each item and compare to like items makes the shopping experience very helpful and informative. I am amazed that I can purchase beautiful clothing for fantastic prices!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Overall it's ok but the express shipping is a lie. I live in Korea and most products come from China still it takes forever to arrive even if it is express and in my case it took longer that it would take with the normal shipping. Also it is not fare that the points (that are very hard to get) just last for so limited period basically is just one month and is unfair because is really hard to get them as well as the cupons. I cannot buy too often and when I wanted to do, all my points where gone"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am on this app every single day, either for myself or my daughters. My orders have been perfect, I can track the shipment from beginning to end, the clothes are beautiful and well made without costing a fortune. I had one issue and contacted customer service without any problems and processed a return quickly and they communicated well. I was hesitant at first, but 100 million downloads can't be wrong."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My package had items missing and I paid for those Items. I am not happy. I did not get the amount of items I paid for.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is pretty fantastic. It's easy to use and has an impressive amount of features for what I thought was just a clothing app. It's easy to see all my points, orders, and tracking information. I give an additional five stars for their ""recommended"" and ""review"" feature. They similar items are always spot on and reasonable substitutes for what I was actually looking at. The reviews section gives detailed instructions and encourages pics so you can see what items actually look like."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely love everything I have ordered! The app is extremely easy to navigate and find what you are looking for or just browse and window shop. Items at fully described and for the most part true to size with the measurements they have listed for each thing. And everything is so cute, and trendy. Me and my girls are obsessed!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Awesome selection of clothing and color schemes that you can choose from for each different item of clothing or set of clothing. They have many useful tools on the website to help you find your size and if you're not satisfied then you can have the option to return the item within 30 days and the process for everything in the app is seamless and easy to use no matter what you are doing. It is easy to search for items by using the search bar or using the categories they have listed on the site!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love shein! The clothes, the shoes, all the accessories, and everything else they have! The app is colorful and fun! My only complaint is they take away points earned- it's super fun to get the points but extremely annoying and frustrating that they are taken away. This app could definitely improve on that! Instead of making their consumers discouraged and take away points they should NOT take away points earned at all. Other then that I really do love Shein!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I will never order again because I paid a lot of tax SHEIN give us discounts but after that discount money we paid it back to the Buffalo delivery Wille it said shipment is free. SCAM
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Awesome place to find super cute stuff for seriously cheap! The quality is actually pretty good. It does take a lil while to get there since its from china but worth it with how cheap it is. Also wanna add that if you pay for expedited shipping, it seriously gets there in a few days versus like a month. I was so skeptical about ordering from Shein at first but I am a loyal customer now for months!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Worst app. they give discount only on screen. and in real we have to pay extra or original price. My order divided into 2 packages and they took my payment of both at first order on original price. and now they are again taking original price of my 2nd package. worst experience. guys don't order on discounted price. they cheat
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I give this amazing app it a four bc 1, I haven't bought anything yet do to saving, but they have such wonderful, cheap, and trendy mf clothes!! Its so easy to purchase items and they have amazing deals. I just had like 5 points a while ago and no I earned about 100 of them just for verifying my email. Such nice things they hav and the quality is just ""mwah"" Especially the accessories. My fave app 😊❤️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Okay so, it's great overall. Lots of good options and clothes, accessories, everything. I just don't get the need to photoshop all your models so much. The plus sized models don't even look plus sized, they look like all the other ones that appear in the catalog. It's not a huge issue, I just don't get why it's done. It doesn't make sense to me."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been shopping with Shein for 4 months now and I'm so hooked , I have no problems with the app. Yes I get free returns but If you have a hard time navigating to find the return print out you can always call and speak with a rep and they will send it to your email. There is deals and reasonable prices. I spend alot of time scrolling though the app because I'm so addicted to ordering stuff I like 👍😅"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's very difficult when you need to speak with someone about your order,refund or returns. I have been waiting for a refund. It still has not be applied back to my account. You can't speak with anyone. Then the chat line. Your speaking with a automated person not a live person. So yeah this is y i gave 3 stars other than that. My returns reached them quickly buy when your waiting on your's is the problem. I like they clothing some might run bigger than some."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great prices...great variety...good quality most of the time. I've never had a bad experience. Gave a 4 star because my mom ordered a dress once and got a blouse and I was the one who introduced her to it so I hated that. Where we're from returning would take a hell of a time so we took the L. Hope it doesn't happen again because I love shopping here.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Get way too many texts. Was not happy with the one and only order I placed. A pin broke the first time I tried to wear it
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Okay. Lets atart off by saying I only wore cheap Tshirts and leggings/sweats. As a big girl with no confidence of course. And I did this for YEARS. I downloaded this app and my life has CHANGED within months. Im wearing Skirts and dresses now! Things that fit me and surprisingly look good too! I can really say I have confidence now. I feel beautiful. I Love this app. 10/10 .
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love this app. The best app ever. The delivery isn't expensive and they always provide coupons to save money. Points are also amazing to get because you save a bunch of money that way. They have everything and it is such an amazing app. 100% recommend for anyone looking towords shopping for cheap prizes. The nail cost 1 buck and they stay pm for a long time. The app is just the best app overall. Used it plenty of times and will keep using it until I die. Download this app. Trust me.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is amazing! Unlike some places they actually sell exactly what's in the photo. They sell counterfeit items but don't claim them to be something their not! You are getting exactly what they say you're getting. They have fantastic size info so you can be absolutely 100% sure you are getting the correct size for your body. They even sell tons more than clothes! They sell hundreds of thousands of products and every single one is useful and awesome. I wish I could give more than 5 stars!!!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Very good apps. Im long time ordering to this apps and ipreciate anything
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been buying from this company for over a 1 1/2 year, the quality of the clothing is amazing, some of them have nothing to envy to designers clothing. You can find really good jewelry in silver 9.25, and cultured pearls for excellent price. Is really easy to browse in the app, and you can even make lists with the categories you need for later. Need to have in mind too that some really cheap articles are hoing to be not so good quality. So I, 100% recommend this app!!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Really cheap, good quality clothing with great sales. It even has different essentials and objects on there, too. For a bit more money but still affordable. The clothes and objects can be a bit sketchy in the material and transparency. the clothes can be super see through and uncomfy sometimes. But the reviews always help clarify in the quality of the clothes. I 10/10 reccomend to people with little money, who appreciate great deals, or and especially college students who have no money like me."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this app! Great selection of clothing and the app is laid out well, easy to use and find things, And no love that it recommends similar styles based on what you're looking at. I also love the reviews and photos from real ppl - great system letting us get points from reviews. Very easy to do returns as well. I love that we can favorite items and that there's always coupons. 100% happy with this app!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have had no problems with this app. Most things I've bought have been as described, just only one purchase that came up a little short in length but is still wearable. Be sure to check the measurements on the sizes though as they do vary from item to item. Do this and you can't go wrong by them not fitting when they arrive. The app is easy to use. Look out for free shipping and discounts. It all helps. Shipping to UK is quick. Yes I'm happy with this app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"FANTASTIC. This site(and app) has a bit of everything at prices I can hardly believe. As a larger person finding fashionable, affordable clothing has been a life long struggle, but no more. If Shein was a person they'd be my best friend. The app is stylish, user friendly and it's never bugged out or shoved ads at me at every turn. Free returns, cheap+fast+tracked shipping, thousands and thousands of listings, excellent quality. I cannot hype Shein and its app up enough."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app is great, but needs some improvements. It would be SO AWESOME if you could have an option to save the filter options. (Even if just for 24 hours) If you accidentally get off the page that you chose filters for, or are trying to look for a new item, everything gets deleted. Which is incredibly annoying because it takes so long to pick everything out. Not to mention, most of the time I completely forget what filters I even like. EDIT: Beware.. their customer service is a joke 😡"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"SheIn is really bad for the environment, because they use cheap material, that can easily be thrown away when a new trend starts, which is basically fast fashion, the jewelry stains your skin, and although the prices are cheap, the earth ends up paying. If you ask me, it's kind of sad, because there are so many small businesses owners, that sell very similar things, yes they tend to be more expensive but they use good materials and will last much longer."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Here's a tip: When this app says gift, it means gamble. This is the most predatory app I have ever seen! This website/app uses models of 'gamifying' sales, which are addictive and are reminiscent of scam techniques like telling users they are 'special winners', have won the 'rare grand prize', etc. It engages in bait and switch salesmanship. I cannot recommend enough people stay away from this app. Buy their stuff online, but don't engage in the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Shoes are low quality. I bought a pair of sandals and one side of the strap was larger than the other.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have been using SHEIN for over a year now and spent a tonne of money. I have placed about 50 orders and only ever had 3 problems. The first 2 times I contacted customer support and the problem was not rectified, so the 3rd time I didn't bother. But other than the customer care, everything else is great. The processing time used to be 1 day, now I'm waiting up to a week, but I understand with the volume of orders that they'll be receiving at the moment. Definitely recommend."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love the app, its super easy to shop! i love the selections that they give, the sorting options, categorys, flash sale. Just all of it!! UPDATE: 1/2021 I placed an order, on 12/14, for roughly $150. It was express and expected to deliver before Christmas or on the 26th. My package updated to a few days after Christmas, then in-transit for 2 weeks, with no updates. Shein gave me a refund! But then my order was delivered a week later and they let me keep the merchandise. A+ Star Rating!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Good items but I give it a 2 star because when I try to find a phone case I can't find the case that fits my phone so can you please put the Samsung A20s please!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is amazing, super easy to use and has billions of options to choose from. The clothing and everything else comes in a variety of colors. Payment options are different, effective and safe no regrets whatsoever. Plus you get discounts and cupouns as savings, points are also available so you don't spend that much. There's also free delivery for a certain amount of money spent so get the app man it's perfect ❤️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is one of the better apps of it's kind, with the ability to sort and search a wish list, very relevant suggestions and the occasional dirt cheap price. In fact there are things I contemplate getting from Shien that I would get from Hot Topic, because of the price. The quality is generally good. The materials vary a lot. Measurements in the descriptions are very helpful for knowing when to size down or up. It would be cool if they did the store cash thing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is probably the BEST clothes shopping app you could possibly get. It has all possible styles anyone could want! It also is very easy to order clothes and tracks where your package is! The clothes are dirt cheap, yet they are very very good quality. I feel like a princess when I wear them!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"good deals, organized layout, fun clothes! I cannot attest to the quality of clothing or shipping because I havent made an order yet; hence the 4 stars. I've been ordering off ROMWE instead because their sizing chart is more detailed and includes in/cm of length measurements which is important when you're tall! but I have noticed an overlap in SHEIN and ROMWE clothing (they sell alot of the same pieces) so I assume the quality is good!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,All packages came so nice and everything fit so well
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,There is just so many products to choose from. And I wish you could choose the page or number item u were on if the page goes back to the top instead of having to scroll all over again. But over all the items are of a decent Quality. Some better than others. But the amazing styles they have is great for adding new and different clothing to your cupboards that will help u stand out from the rest
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have ordered from this site consistantly for over a year(lost over 100lbs) and I have been very happy with it. As long as I go by my measurements, for each item purchased, I have no problems. There was one issue when I ordered a dress that the cut just didnt look right on me, and I found the return process is simple."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a ok brand to shop, especially plus size clothes and although the quality of the items isn't the best, I think it's enough for what we are paying. You just have to be really careful and read the comments in order to get quality stuff, but overall it's great and I would continue shopping here just when is super necessary cause in fact, this's a fast fashion brand and it's not quite the best option in sustainability."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The Worst app I've ever used!! Ordered a couple of items and had to sent few back. Haven't heard from them since and it was more than 4 months ago. Would not order or trust this app and would not recommend it to anyone!!!!! Unless you want to lose your money. Impossible to get it contact with anyone or get a response. Absolute joke!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Clothing size varies between objects so its best to read the description of the product but overall the app is great. Everything is affordable. There are multiple sale opportunities and shipping comes right on time. You can even track your package once itd been purchased. I love it.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Everything is fake between the models modeling to receiving not was pictured all the way to the games promise free prize and shipping you just have to make 2 separate orders of over $10 to win which pays for the $20 shipping overseas liar liars quite ironic there's no where to comment the truth except for the apps platform you can't even talk to a Real person when there's an issue with your order which 2/3 orders there were issues the 3rd order was a complete flop from what I ordered
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is such an amazing app and is the only clothes shopping app that I use and trust. Shein is such an amazing app in fact that I almost wish they had their own store, they totally should build one. Their clothes match expectations really well, but sometimes their clothes are smaller than the size you order. That's fine though because most of the time you can just size up. The point system is amazing and I really appreciate it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love shein, and order often however I do have just a few issues. 1) You don't always get all the product options when you search for something. You need to go in the 'recommended' section to find more. 2) if you add a size filter for say 2xl and 3xl, you will only find products that have BOTH sizes available. Not products that have one or the other. 3) lastly the delivery charges are so high :( I can't always order above 149DHS at a time so it gets pretty expensive."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I honestly love shein. Because of the free return it is so convenient it allows me to shop more. The sizing can be inaccurate on the app but atleast you have the security to return and get all full refund. instant return label will be issued. They refund whatever amount you paid even after the discount. Some other shopping app would recalculate the amount and you won't get what you paid, instead less. Other shopping app from china is unreliable when it comes to return and refund."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Worst shopping experience ever. I made an order around 2 month ago, first time I received completely different items, and customer services are the worst, just telling lies to get rid of customers. They say it takes 4-7 days to collect wrong items, well it took one month, again another month to receive my correct items, and finally I was so happy when I received the package, but guess what!! again missing items!! Seeiouy!! Very disappointed!!!! All reviewers didn't even receive their items yet!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Loved the fact that the sizes are TRUE. Out of twenty items, only two didn't fit just right. The rest were keepers! The return process was a confaluted, but I managed to figure it out my way. The bags that the clothes come in are very helpful also. Not only to store, but to use in returning. All in all, a darn good experience!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Theres not just clothing on here! Theres home decor and makeup. Everything is suprisingly cheap for how good looking the clothes are, and the material is good as well! New things come in often. The only thing I dont like is the shipping, I live in the us so yes its going to take a long time to get here, it usually takes 3 weeks while amazon comes in less than a week, other than that SHEIN is a great app and its by far my favorite shopping app!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been buying from shien for over 18 months and have completely replaced my wardrobe now. I have only ever been disappointed on 2 occasions with the goods. I find them, good quality, fair priced, excellent in style and also bout as Christmas and birthday presents. The app is easy to use. The delivery service has never been late. I've recommended on many occasions. Brilliant app, for excellent choices and quality products."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Before you can used up to 70% of your points to check out an item, but now you can only used up to 30% of your points. Will not use it anymore, neither recommend it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"i love their clothing, I would order in bulks. but, returning an item is impossible. Your unable to cancel your order online, your unable to edit your order once you click the submit order botton, even if it was 5 seconds after. you have to pay $8 per item to return it, and the 2shirts that were $8 when I ordered, went up to $13 before they processed it. 🤦‍♀️. im disappointed mainly in customer service. i deleted the app because i asked to remove the top and they left it there anyway and shipped"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Update broke it? Ever since I updated the app it is not accepting any of the payment methods when I check out. Customer service in the app is sometimes live and sometimes not. Additionally, my cart (or anything else associated with my account) doesn't sync when I log in on a desktop. I need this issue fixed asap so I can order in time for Christmas!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great products with informative reviews to ensure you know what you're purchasing. Easy to browse and so many categories to select. I have purchased clothing for the whole family, Xmas decorations, homewares, makeup, electronics. It is a fun place to shop. You can also collect points that give you further discounts off your total."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was very doubtful at first. Expected the clothes/shoes to not be my size or poorly made. However I was pleased with my first purchase and I've made many more. Great for ""plus sized"" ladies. (Since when was a size 16 plus?) And a large range of accessories that are well made. A tiny annoyance is some of the reviews from people are just song lyrics. Not sure... what that is about. But the fact you can upload photos of what the outfit is. The regular discount codes. Worth it!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely fantastic! The quality and shipping time has always been fantastic! If you have multiple things in your order and it hasn't shipped after 5 days TOPS I 100% guarantee that at least one thing in your order is on backorder. This will hold up the entire order. Reach out to customer service by the in app chat option and just question the delay in shipping on that order. You'll be given the option to cancel that item and get a refund, split ship the order or wait until it's all in stock."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love Shein. You can find some really good deals and you get points for shopping that you can redeem at a later time. They also have a fraud squad that notifies you if any weird activity or purchases have been made on your account which I found was really cool. The app is really convenient and makes it easy to scroll through the pictures. Because of the reward system there are also many reviews and pictures of the items from real buyers. I definitely recommend Shein.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love the app and the store! I've had this app for a few months. I use it several times a week for retail therapy from home. It has never crashed, it doesn't eat up my battery power, it isn't storage intense, and it saves my information every time I close it. I was able to personalize my notifications via email and push. Love it!!!"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was a bit skeptical at first due to the low prices, and for sure some things are hit and miss, but returns on clothing and shoes are free (as long as you bundle them in one package) and they've never played games with any of my returns/refunds and I've purchased well over a dozen times now. I appreciate the meticulous tracking, notifications and honesty of this company and will continue to use them!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love shein. The app is great! It is very user friendly. Very easy to save stuff you like and come back later to purchase. They also tell you if it's almost out of stock. Tracking is always up to date and shipping is fast! My last order took 6 days to get to me. I ALSO LOVE SHEIN CURVE! Thanks for all my beautiful clothes!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Shein used to be great but there's 5 new changes I HATE : 1) free shipping used to be for 19€ or more. Now it's 49€ or more. 2) express shipping is no longer available 3) points expire and vouchers have a much shorter life span than before 4) you can no longer return sale items 5) you can't use your points/vouchers towards discounted items. The best thing about shein was that it was cheap and risk free. Add all these rules and you're better of shopping elsewhere with better quality.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great products, delivery and return service ( when required). Love the Curve selection. A huge variety and the fit is really good. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the only downside is the pretty lingerie for curves, has really thin straps, which is uncomfortable and useless. Love everything else though. ❤ 80% of my wardrobe in now Shein 🤦‍♀️😄🥰"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Would give less if I could. Site is glitchy, will charge you surprise fees or not send items it's charged you for! Customer service is rude and illiterate. Items are poor quality. You're honestly better off on temu"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best shopping app! This is my favourite shopping app. The clothes are true to size and good quality. I shop so much on SHEIN I love it, it's very addictive. They sell everything from clothes, to home decor, to craft supplies, to things for your pets, and things you didn't even realise you wanted until you see them on the site. I'm a little hooked I think."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Mostly satisfied. Quality isnt top tier, but for the price, thats expected. Aside from that, I really only dislike how hard it is to find tops that aren't super cropped, the lack of accountability when reviewers post photos of something other than the product, & how quickly the points/coupons expire."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This store is amazing. High quality products for the prices. Love the dresses. Returns are easy if something doesn't fit properly. I buy all my clothes from here now. The material is fantastic! Love the flash sales and price drops to move stock out. Just make sure you read the measurements as all the sizing can vary quite a bit.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Shein is great when you first get the app and are a new customer. After that you're on your own. Their products are more miss than hit. Sizing is ALL OVER THE PLACE! returns are possible on somethings, but the stuff you're stuck with is defective or sized completely wrong. i.e you can be a small in jeans or large. The underwear is a joke in sizing. The LARGE fits my size 2 sister while the XL in another style has to be donated because it falls off completely. This is fast fashion. Risky :("
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app honestly sells a lot for very cheap. The quality of everything I have bought from the women's section the the men's is absolutely on point. The shoes are good, the clothes, the animal section, the plus size women, it has it all to even home decor. It's all very cheap for amazing quality. I just wish the shipping wasn't so much and it didn't take like almost two weeks for one order to arrive but most of the time it's shipped within three days and it gets here way before it is scheduled."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I was looking through your site. Now I get a text every 2 to 3 minutes. I have tried to mute them. It does not work.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Although some items are not that great (globe that it wasn't obvious it was labelled in an Asian language not English), clothes are brilliant quality, true to size and delivery is quicker than expected. I originally used another app Wish and have completely converted to SHEIN. The app is great as its always offering discounts and vouchers!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Never on time, then the clothes look cheap. They make it look appealing to get stuff but not worth it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Best +size and mens collection! I ordered and was quite sceptical about quality and if things would fit after being told shein is wish but for clothes. I was proven wrong when I got my delivery. Everything was amazing quality. The sizing was completely accurate for everything I bought. I will be ordering again. This is by far the best place to order +size and curve clothing from the choices are absolutely incredible I've never seen so much plus size and curve from one place. And men's as well!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Absolutely adore Shein! Their clothes are true to size and I haven't experienced any as hrinkage with jumpers or dresses made from specialized fabrics! Their app is easy to use/ navigate and if you have any problems with orders they have no problem cancelling your orders. Same goes for Romwe who sell a lot of the same stuff. Both great!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,A bug made me delete the app for good. Somehow 3 items ended up in my total during checkout when it is not in my cart. It cannot be modified nor deleted. I tried deleting and re-installing. I checked if the app needed updating but there's nothing. The 3 items automatically adds to my total everytime I try to checkout so now I can't check out anything making the app completely useless now. I guess this is where my shopping with Shein ends.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"You can't beat the prices or the coupons that this store offers. Each piece of clothing comes separately in a pretty nice (compared to the cheap, thin plastic bags that most in person retail stores use nowadays) thick, plastic zip up bag. The clothes are super great quality, but they are WAY better than you'd expect them to be for the price!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Too many bothersome notifications irritating beyond belief
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The website is great! There are so many reviews in all the cloths and every item. Each clothing item and accessories are all great prices and there are an abundance of options to chose from. The only thing I think they should change, is the layout of there page... it is a little bit disorganized for me."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Okay! So I'm writing an honest reviews after spending thousands of bucks in shein. The clothes displayed looks super nice and yes is probably expensive but the quality sucks.These all are Chinese products so you can't rely on the quality. Once you wear it starts tearing from the middle. The products are not really worth it. Doesn't matter some of the clothes are good but I'm giving two stars because of size and poor quality issue. Once you wash the cloth it becomes useless👎. Not recommended.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I haven't had a lot of issues with quality of clothing i've only had 2 issues but, they weren't even bad. Some of the sizing is off which annoys me. I wish that when you place an order you could write an instruction incase people needs to say something important. other than that shein is a really good and fantastic shop."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,A lot of my plus size looks are from Shein. It's very user friendly and the items always arrive before expected. I highly recommend for fashionistas on a budget. The other plus is they give you multiple options or a variant of the style you want. They even give you options as to what would pair well with your choice just incase you aren't the most stylish.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This minigames is absolutely just horrible, HORRIBLE!!! I spent 40 dollars on orders for the minigane puppy love, and I didn't even get the item I wanted. It just got me up to 99.1. I tried contacting support about it and it just said failed to contact the agent. Then I tried to email BUT THAT WOULDNT EVEN SEND! it's truly unfairand I was scammed on this."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this website/app. Makes fashionable shopping much easier and better prices than those boutiques! When your clothes arrive the quality, style and fit of clothes is amazing. Plus you get the whole fitting guide when you are searching for the right fit....be sure to have your measurements ready! Its good to have that anyway if you have to get fitted for a formal dress or suit anyway! Shoes are my thing and I love every single one of my shoes I have purchased. Great quality and super comfortabl"

They don't just sell clothes there's all sorts like pets items, blankets, coushion covers, stickers, pens all sorts it's been neat finding all the different little things on here. They offer discount codes & points to make it cheaper for you. Delivery is usually always before due date & everything is always packaged separately which I love."

Clothing is very on trend in a variety of sizes. Clothing is also decent quality. I have ordered several items from SHEIN, and I have not had a problem to date. I'm very satisfied with the quality, style level, and especially the prices! I've been shopping with Shein over 2 years, and it's still good!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this app. I am satisfied with most of the items that I have purchased thus far. Most of the pictures are the same as the products. The size guide is useful. Please read product reviews,size measurements and descriptions when selecting an item. Good tracking system.Free shipping from a certain amount,weekends a lesser amount.Wish lists and board creations make it easier to save products for future purchases."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I give it 4 stars becsuse all the stuff is such good condition and good prices but just one star of because the time takes a bit long to get to you. Thank you from b

There are TONS of quality materials to choose from, along with household, pet, and miscellaneous items that can ve purchased as well. It accepts many different forms of payments. There's always sales, coupons, and discounts to access as well. This app always has me in the cutest threads and they get my money for quality items all the time. LOVE LOVE LOVE SHEIN FASHIO APP."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Ordering from shein a few years now, never received a bad item, we always measure ourselves and check sizes before ordering. We've bought bikinis, jeans, dresses, t-shirt you name it all great value and good quality. The reviews and photos from customers are great too so you can see what clothes look like on real people as apposed to tiny models. Never waiting too long for delivery. Only thing I don't like is the over use of plastic, every item is placed in a sealed plastic bag."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I want to return some items but the option is not working. Surprisingly buying option , payment option is working but return option is not working."

It's not often that I can purchase up to date, stylish plus size clothing that doesn't break the bank. Their sales are fabulous and delivery is quite timely. I'm very happy that a friend recommended Shein and the app to me. I've never had a problem or issue with the app, it works just as it should. Their quality is great!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is very useful for those days when you can't be bothered to move. The system is simple yet so effective and Ads are only shown once you open the app. They have a range of clothing, accessories or plain items. All with different sizes, shapes and colours all for you to choose. Definitely recommend!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"i definitely love the GIGANTIC selection this site/app offers, & they ease with which you can navigate everything. i do find that i am a bit confused on *everything* that they offer... i'm still finding these random little surprises, or offers, within the app... which *is* fun - BUT... i *do* wish there was some way that i could know about all of it just, or at least where to find it all, up front."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love Shein, and I would totally rate it 5 stars BUT 2 small problems.. 1. Is shipping, takes kind of long 2-3 weeks to me in North Carolina. Not too bad I mean I'm patient so it wasnt that big of a deal and plus what I got was totally worth the wait!!! 2. The show shoes sizes on the site are kind of complicated to figure out, but once you study it , you can get it. So other than that I dont have any complaints. So many varieties of items to choose from. I will definitely be ordering"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The search and filter criteria needs major redesign especially for fashion the is available in both Women and Curves/Plus. If a user searches for a particular size, then Out of Stock should be excluded from the results or there should be an option to filter out items that are out of stock for the sizes specified. There should also be an option to filter results returned from a search by ""key word"" using the search bar."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,There are so many clothing options for the whole family as well as accessories and shoes. I love all the random discounts and free shipping offers and point system. The best part is that the app works really well. I have had no issues. One feature I really like is how it generates a sinilar style under an item you chosen to view.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app works fine but shein is basically a scam. I had to return all the clothes I got because they were ill fitting and cheaply made. Shein doesn't refund what you originally pay but what the item costs when you say you'll return it. I ended up losing a significant sum of money bc sales started. The clothes all look great, but when you get them, there's bound to be something wrong with them..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app. I think myself and many others would appreciate the option of reviewing items separately, instead of being limited to review the whole order at a time. Its more convenient and promotes accuracy and honesty"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have ordered A LOT of different items from here. Kitchen tools, projector humidifiers, clothing, makeup, fake nails, jewelry, drain snakes, etc...and all of it is really great quality. My only problem is it takes a really long time to actually get my order but with this pandemic that is to be expected."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Really good app - easy to use and find information on orders, payments, deliveries etc. The app shows 'flash sales' and 'daily offers' with great prices. The searches are a bit hit and miss (poss a language/translation issue) and some items are put in unusual categories and not so easy to find. I would like to be able to bookmark/wishlist a particular colour/size not an entire multi-listing. Shein is great - fair prices, fast delivery & really easy to return goods (refunds come back quickly) 👍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Unexpectedly amazing. I was super nervous about ordering from a company overseas. I thought at best I'd get something that would just get me by until I could buy something more expensive and long-lasting. But after my first order came in, I found everything was packed neatly (even the individual items were facing the same way in the shipping package!); when I went through and looked at each shirt, both my mom and I were really surprised to find that everything was so dang well-made! Love Shein!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Some products are great, some are made of cheap materials. Size is usually spot on with their clothes. Shipping is cheap and they always have flash sales and occasionally have free shipping deals on purchases of $9.95 or higher. It's worth trying. Take a chance it's not so bad here."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,GREAT Store Great App! ❤️ Love shopping on the app. There is SOOOOOO much to see. I'm almost OVERWHELMED. HONESTLY. I can spend hours on there and get LOST. I mean really. Sometimes I just can't. I have to save and get off I've created boards like Pinterest and that helped. I created wish list that helped. There are so many deals. You just want it all. Then when I think I have it narrowed I find another. It's a lot for a Virgo. A perfectionist can get overwhelmed but it's great sales. Yes TY💯

I have had several orders completed successfully and have been really happy with items received.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love Shein! First of all they make being fashionable affordable, so thank you for that. I mean you can get a whole box of clothes for the price of one designer pair of shoes. And as to fast fashion being ""oh so bad"" come on. It's just another attack on women. Think about it....plastic kids toys, diapers, electronics, batteries etc etc are all just as bad if not worse and yet they attack us over fashion??? Shein is very clear about measurements, fabric type, and sizing. Totally recommend!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So far having a fantastic experience with SHEIN. The app is fun and easy to use - I like all of the incentives with points and reviews. The quality of the clothing so far is fine, good size ranges, but my favourite part of the site is the crafts, stickers and homewear section. Such pretty and great quality decorations! Shipping to UK is quite good too! Took less time to arrive than they predicted (around 1.5 weeks)."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The shopping experience is very random. I ordered twitch here and 100% of the time I attempted to oversize my clothes and ended up being the complete opposite. IE; 2xl fitting like a small or medium. They are really not clear with sizes or material and from what I've seen the better designs for men are normally rubbery. Will never be using this app again
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The shein app is legit the best clothing app, it doesn't freeze up. You can make orders on ur phone, it's honestly so easy to use. It's just like going on the website, things are easy to find. Just type the clothing you want and it will give you the options then and there. Anytime you go into the app or website, it immediately offers you coupons and discounts for EVERYONE. The clothes are cheap, good quality and trendy. Perfect for adults and teens."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,So far so good. I've ordered twice from this app and I love the clothes and prices! Yes they are cheap but the quality is decent and the only thing you may have to worry about is see through because of the material. Just wear dark under garments. I gave it a four because the shipping takes a little long to me but overall the merchandise is excellent.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein doesn't disappoint. The products are always of good quality and are delivered within the given time frame. Only thing that sucks, is when it comes to items that shows a random colour will be picked for you. It would be nice to at least be able to pick a gender so the item isn't useless when you receive something pink for a boy for instance. I will NOT make use of any pink items for my boys. Even being able to communicate with the seller/s before and even after ordering, would be great."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is Amazing 👏! It is my go to shop, a phenomenal online shopping experience with such a vast collection. I am more than happy with the - over £300 worth of stuff I have bought on this site and now its an app! One click and its open on your phone. They have plenty for everyone of all shapes, colours, types, styles its crazy. Definitely recommend! Good range of grunge stuff too must say.♡"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app, however i see sometimes things are not funcioning correctly like for example the free trial center works only sometimes and this is something i think should be made better as it is an opportunity for people to review your products and convince others to buy it with pictures and a full on explanation of material used and fitting. I would love to change this to 5 stars after this is correctly fixed :)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app for shopping quality products. I've been ordering for quite a while now and the average shipping is 1-2 weeks. Also, the items from household to outfits are in great quality. Item description and measurements are available too. It also gives you a simple guide to ensure that the dress/clothes you'll get are in perfect fit! I also love the points I earn, I can use it as a discount! Great app!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is an amazing shopping app. Perfectly setup so shopping is made easy.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have loved everything purchased at shein. I only had 1 problem and that was a strain on the back of one of the garments, I loved it and they were sold out so I didn't want to return it. So that's why I gave 4 stars. Another complaint is the very effective push notifications. I get texts several times per day! It gets a little overwhelming because the suck me right in! My last complaint is the search function isn't great. It doesn't always show the items that I'm looking for."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This website ticks all the boxes from a great range of products, great prices, great reviews with photos of the product so that you can decide if the quality or look is what you thought it was. It let's you make a wish list amongst other exciting perks and also let's you keep your items in your bag area and if from all those items in your bag you just want to buy one it allows you to select which items you want to pay for if not all at the same time without moving items. Just an all round 5* app"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was sceptical of shein; my first order was just some small things like phone cases, trainers and a jumper, this was so I could see how long it took to arrive and what state it would be in! It's was all brilliant and so cheap. I've probably made an order per month for the past 6 months, and the deliveries are getting much quicker; some arrive within a week. I love the quality of the clothing too, now I've found my comfy size I have no major concerns when ordering as I know it will fit. 5☆"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The clothing can occasionally have manufacturing errors and the material isn't the most comfortable in the universe, but for the price it's PHENOMENAL. It was a real life saver when we got slammed with a hear wave right after buying a house. I was able to get swims, tanks, tops, and shorts without breaking the bank. It's hot girl summer on a budget!"

Most of the clothes have amazing quality for the price, of course one or two items will be a little small or big or the quality isn't the best, but for me thats been a rare thing. I recommend."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It has great clothing options for cheap prices. However, when I ordered something, it wanted me to give proof of transaction through bank statement or something? When I couldn't provide it, it decided to cancel my order. I really wanted those clothes."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love this app!! The clothes are always so cute!! And the customer service is very responsive if I have a question with anything. The delivery is always a day or two early than expected with is a beautiful surprise. The quality of the clothes is also amazing. I forever will be a customer with SHEIN!! Definitely would recommend. 20/10♥♥♥ I would even love to model for them if I had the chance!! 🥰
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Worst shopping site ever anyone would use!! I really recommend NOT to shop from this site! The quality of the stuff are not good at all and not just once, this has happened thrice with me. They cancel the order without informing and dont even refund the amount to your respective bank a/c they just add on to the points in your Shein wallet and that too not the full amount. I JUST DONT RECOMMEND THIS SHOPPING APP TO PEOPLE. IT'S A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Cute clothes at affordable prices. However its nearly impossible to get a hold of their customer service. I have been trying to get a hold of a human (not an automated chatting robot) for days! Very frustrating process trying to get someone to help me. I've been checking on my tracking every day and it shows that it's been in ""transit from Hong Kong"" for 5 days now. Either their not updating the status of my order or I didn't realize that it takes weeks days to travel."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love shein. It has cute, trendy, and fashionable clothes that are cheap and affordable. Everything is great like no problems and all. One thing that i have little problem is that the sizings are not accurate sometimes. One time I got a medium for jeans because I looked at the sizing. I got the jeans but they were tight on my waist. I gave it to a friend and bought a large. They were really happy. Sizings are not always accurate just to let you know Anyways good app overall really love it!!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This site has so many products to those from with great deals, point and vouchers to use. Delivery mostly on time, clothing/shoes are mostly prefect and good material. Sizes are all different so read the comment section before you pick a size. I have never returned an item mostly because it sounds to complicated and isnt worth it since you get them for so cheap. Over all im very happy with shein and have bought from here many times and will do in the future."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great clothing and accessories at great price. Delivery is as scheduled. The app gives an estimate of delivery times and you can track delivery through app. Sizing is pretty accurate and pics of past customers wearing the outfits makes it an easy purchase. Large selection of items too :)
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have a SheIn addiction. The shipping time is atrocious. Simply ATROCIOUS. But the price of items is usually pretty decent, especially if you use their coupon codes. Once you get an idea of the quality of different types of clothing, both men's and women's, you will enjoy you items a lot more and you'll return less items. My first 3 or 4 orders were horrible and sizes were all over the place. But I've learned what to order and what to stay away from. Shipping is HORRIBLE tho!!!!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Honestly I was incredibly nervous at first when I decided to order from Shein. But they have gone beyond my expectations I love their clothes and being able to see the sizing of clothing. Shipping has been incredibly smooth and great at communication. Since then I've been happily coming back each time. I definitely recommend Shein for people who struggle to find their size.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I find their items EXPENSIVE, sometimes really expensive but I still go for it because what you see in the picture is what you get. The quality of the clothes are great, besides the graphics that attract you to it. When you save up and you want good stuff, go for SHEIN..!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The app used to be good but ever since the latest update there's a bug. I can't enlarge the customers' photos of the products in the customers' reviews section. All I can see is the tiny thumbnail pictures. Customers' photos are helpful because they show the real product so you can see the quality and fit on real people. The model pictures are not always representative of the actual product. Please fix this bug.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Im not a girly girl at all(hate shopping/full face makeup). So glad i was shown this app because its the only place i get my clothes now😁 It's super easy, fast and fun might i add!! The points are a huge major plus along with the coupons and codes, also the 3 level vip is cool(i'm now lvl 2 within 2/3 months)! It's not only clothes i can buy too and i love that aswell!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,If I could give this I zero I would because everytime you order something it takes forever to deliver it took a month.and the clothes are horrible quality pants came with holes and other pants were extremely see through
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love shien, I just wish you could customize orders a little more. So I left that review awhile ago and I've seen them allow you to customize your order more and they also have been true to keeping good quality and it still be affordable. I've also notice that they included new things that make the experience more creative! I've looked up items that I couldn't find anywhere else and see them not have it and then I come back later and see that they've added it to their stock! LOVE IT"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The Fashions are Absolutely HIGH QUALITY. Beautiful STYLISH fashions at economical prices and low shipping charge. Free shipping is also periodically offered. Measurements are listed for each size you select. This is the best online system for buying women's clothes I have ever seen !!! Oh I forgot, returns ARE FREE WHEN USING THEIR RETURN LABEL."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"With a discount Shein is a good go to for various fashion items.On the whole the items are good value for money with a large range,quality is a little hit or miss though as is the sizing.The only major issue I have is the time taken to receive parcels,it's generally 2/ 3 weeks but some items arrive within days,it would be nice if they could tell you when ordering which items would be delivered early especially when needing things in a hurry.Returns are relatively easy and good though at 45 days."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best shopping app ever!!! I'm not sure if the things come from China, as their quality is impeccable. And yes, the prices are amazingly cheap!!! Top top top!! The delivery is super fast!! Less than 3 weeks, it always come a week before the estimated delivery date The clothes in general is true to size and exactly as seen on photos. This is my new favourite online store!!! I would give more than 5* if I could. Thanks shein!!!! ☺️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Everything is good quality,ever since I started shopping at Shein I have been satisfied with their service. You get good quality at an affordable price."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, has cute affordable clothing. I love that the products have reviews that include images, it really helps me with knowing if an item looks exactly like the picture or not. It also takes less than 14 days to deliver to Ontario. The app is so easy to use, plus if you check in everyday you earn points that translate to money that you can cash in as a discount. I have nothing but good things to say for the store and the app!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Although it is fast fashion, it does offer a wide range for plus sized women, which is so helpful for me as shopping for clothing is really difficult. I would love if more clothing companies and brands had bigger sizes, but this is the best option I have personally. That I am greatful for. But I still gave it 2 stars for obvious economic reasons. Hope this changes, although unlikely. ❤️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app so much! I've never been interested in pants since I have a curvy body and having a hard time to choose a perfect/fit size for me (Sadly, I always wear leggings due to its free size before), but I'm glad Shein came and I'm able to wear different types of pants from them, smooth transaction, lots of vouchers and reward points!! I'm bit disappointed with their delivery process this holiday season, some of my orders are delayed. I hope Shein do something to make it more efficient."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I like the prices but you have to be careful when you order clothes. They are not true to your size they fit kinda small.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really love this app. The shipping is really fast and I had only one negative experience of my items shipped separately, but overall I was able to get everything I ordered. Reasonable prices and I love that you can see the reviews and comments on items. That really helps me out while shopping! Im one happy customer😁😁😁"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,this is one of my favorite online stores. there are so many clothes for so cheap and they have the best sales. I was able to get my friend 3 shirts and a few other things for just 20 dollars. the reason for one star off is when you return something you have to pay and sometimes it's just not worth returning because your paying more than what the clothing item even costed but overall I loving getting new clothes from shein and hope to purchase more in the future😁
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I started buying from Shein last year, and they've never disappointed me. The prices and quality of the products are amazing, my main reason for shopping. The app is also super easy to navigate and so is the tracking. I also like how they give you estimates on your delivery the day you order and it will either arrive a little before or right on time. I haven't bought clothes from any other online places because Shein has been go to since I found out about them."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"1 star solely because I got spammed with near 100 notifications one a single day. Once the holidays hit this app does way too much and becomes a solid nuisance. I downloaded the app cause I like the store, I don't need reminders to shop. That's my intention, so the incredible amount of spam notifications completely turned me off. Besides that, the app is nice to use and easy to navigate. I'd keep it if they didn't bombard me with stupid notifications"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I always loveed shein and i love the items you have but now with delays you have i will never shopping here. My orders is from 2 and 5 December ok it is before Christmas and ok everyone is shopping that's why i begin to shop early but my orders is not to find from 18 December shein is not known where my orders is 🤬🤬🤬 . It is a shame because it was for gifts so now for Christmas i have no gifts so thank a lot Shein. That's why people go to another shops because they come quickly 😉
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Know your height, bust, waist, and hip measurements. Items are individually sized so what is an XS for you in one outifit could be a S in another. There are not enough special releases for plus sizes and I strongly recommend being able to choose different sizes on 2-piece items: If I wanted a 2 piece swimsuit a 3x would be great up top but I would like to be able to choose a 2x on the bottom because my butt isn't big and my legs are short. Some people have very diverse proportions."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really good material for the price. I was impressed with the options for sizes because me and my fiancee are really picky when it come to buying ANYTHING off line. You guys rock, only thing I feel could've been better is the Express shipping since I paid for the convenience off express shipping, but you due to the weather conditions I accepted that. Very good overall!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Nice app. The problem with it is that it consumes lot of battery it would be nice if it could be optimize. Love the points system, the give away, the lives. It is overall a fun application. Would be nice if we could create folders in the ""my saves"" items."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The fashion quotient in this app has no bounds.It's styles are absolutely amazing.It also provides you the platform to showcase you're creativity. Many product reviews are available to help you find the perfect dress and perfect fit! If you're a hopeless fashionista like me, you're gonna love this app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"All this time I thought SheIn was just womens clothes until I found they sell home organization, party decor, bedding, maternity clothes, and so much more! Things I've nearly spent triple the price on Amazon, I now go on SheIn and 75% of the time they have it for cheaper! Delivery is easy to track and fast! (Usually 10-14 days) Returns/Refunds are easy too and I've only had one issue and with my screenshots it was resolved quickly. I'm happy with my orders and it's quality 90% of the time!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Twice I've done express shipping and both times my items were delayed and there was no refund given. Why pay an extra 12+ for earlier shipping and still have to wait for your items.Secondly, the customer service needs to be improved. Whenever there is an issue, there this silly ticket system that is very frustrating and useless. Customers should be able to speak to a representative like other companies to get clarity."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, the quality of the goods wasn't top tier but because of the prices and the points system it was my favorite. However, this changed drastically yesterday from the best online shopping app to the worst. Suddenly, all items got 20% higher in price and the points that I've been collecting for the past month had been canceled. Because of that I'm downloading Romwe since it has exactly the same goods with cheaper prices. The 2 featurs that made this app unique and favored by all are gone now"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very inexpensive way to replace your entire wardrobe including shoes and accessories. We typically do not keep up with fashion and tend to have the same fashion sense or style for decades when other countries change out their entire wardrobe at least 4 times a year. Thanks to Shein we can now afford to change our clothing based on the new trends!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"What i really like about Shein is the color of it's product is exactly like the photo, kudos to the photography team!! It comes with honest review so you know exactly what to expect from the product , details of the fabric and etc. You can get something that look expensive without bursting your budget!!! Keep up the good work Shein team."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love the app, the clothes and basically everything from Shein! Delivery always on time and you can track your order. Sizes are usually spot on and quality of items all good so far. With daily flash sales and other price drops, points earned to use as money off you really don't have to spend a lot to get what you like. Do recommend the site."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Ugh...I love Shein. I'm way to addicted. Most of their products are surprisingly well made for the prices. Some sizing may vary which can make it a little challenging.... but a good rule of thumb is to order 1 size up or down depending on the fit of the clothing item.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I'm still new with this app but man am I enjoying it 😊 I'm pleased with the delivery time because the estimated date of arrival seems to be way longer so I guess it's setting up the business to succeed because as a client you anticipate the delivery of the package to take long and a pleasant surprise happens when it actually comes earlier. The only downside for me is that the return process is not easily visible or accessible on the app which is a bummer because I have to now try to sell a item
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Okay, after a solid year I have to say that SHEIN is one of my top online shopping store! I like piecing outfit together and shein gives me that opportunity within my budget. I've had two had screwball order and they resolved it quickly. This is shopping on a budget. Once you learn your Shein size you can look cute, also great place to try out new things if you're trying to change your wardrobe or see if a certain look looks good on you"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love shein the clothes there are amazing. I was surprised they had more to offer than just clothes. The items are very reasonable and affordable. I havnt bought anything yet cause I don't have card but I made a wish list of things I want. ALTHOUGH It is best to look at the reviews as sometimes the clothes being modeled don't always look the same when bought cause u know, Photoshop and editing. So again, I advice you to always look at the reviews and see what they actually look like when bought"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The clothes are cheap and some are attractive on but the quality of the clothes is unreliable for example I bought several jumpers some fit beautifully while others have sleeves that are very short even though I perched them larger than my size. Also, I was sold a dusty leggings with a hole in it and a jumper with a ripped shoulder which I noticed while wearing at work. Almost the entire contents of my shopping of over 70 pieces where super dusty which need shaking out properly."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Really good stuff good for price love there jewellery
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"An entertaining app that allows one to pass time or engage with others while shopping. An interesting experience as it's like shipping online and, like in person in a way due to the ability to enage in fun activities such as socializing with others. Its platform is a bit wild in that in can be complex to use in a user easy way but it is not the most complex app. I think there should be clearer ways to use all the functions of the app, however 6.88/10 simply due to lack of clear functional use.:)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love all the different kinds of styles and selections that shein offers as well as the sho seize. Shein always seems to have some coupon or Bogo going on and the prices are very fair. The only issue is that I placed a fairly large order with them, noticed I was missing 3 or 4 items and I've not had any response. (Update) 2nd order the ""pleather"" moto jacket I got material is obviously cheap and I got the smallest sizes available but they are still rather big on me so I have to return them."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,So far I have great experiences with Shein. Most of the stuff I ordered are clothing and they delivered fast and the quality of the clothing are good. Though I have a tough times getting the right fitting on jeans or shorts. As for sport bra I wish they have D cups size but small bottoms. Cheap and good qualities definitely better then Wish!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is addicting!! I am super addicted to shein. I had to delete the app at one point! I love the clothes and that you can find anything under the sun that you need. Please just carefully read the reviews before you buy!! I'm super excited to see the fall/winter collection this year. Keep up the great sales !
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"So I Love the items, some are made with cheap material but some are also really good. I decide whether or not to buy something based off of photos and their ratings. App is real simple, the only down side is that you gotta wait like 2-3 weeks for stuff to get to you. Other than that I think its pretty good."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"EDIT/ UPDATE: Disappointed in the app. In the last few years features have not been improved. Erratic sizing makes shopping cumbersome, not fun. So far so good. The app is great. Since it stores my measurements in the personal profile it would be nice if the app would apply those numbers and automatically select the appropriate size since tge sizes do vary greatly but measurements of each garment are given."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great prices, love the review section from buyers because a lot of people add photos wearing the products which help me in choosing my purchases. As long as you check out the sizing in inches/cm of the products before purchasing, there shouldn't be many issues of the sizing being inaccurate in my experience"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love clothes and Shein has it 😂 that's not the only reason why I love shein, but it has reasonable prices for hair accessories, sweat shirts, leggings, and so much more. Shein has mainstream clothing but also classy clothing and has almost every kind of aesthetic you enjoy for such an awesome price, and don't get me started on the quality (it's great) Look, if you are shopping for something cute and unique Shein has it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Entire transaction was smooth. Easy shopping on the app, great selection. Have only ordered once Took a couple weeks. Items were well pkg'd, way better quality than expected & sizes were TRUE. Ordered in multiple sizes, expecting it all to run small. Prices are very reasonable. Not returning anything yet; stay tuned for feedback 😊 Another new go-to for this online shopper."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"AWESOME prices and products! I've purchased a LOT of items from them (like 75),have returned a few (5 or so), but have REALLY liked most of the rest (like 60ish/70). I would give them a 9/10 rating. Just make sure you read each item's sizing guidelines as they vary. I tell everybody about SHEIN and always look here first when shopping!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"4 stars nothing of their fault, I'm simply new to the ap & store and haven't had a chance to see what all it offers. However it seems to be a very convenient app to use so far. I absolutely love their clothes & even more I absolutely love love love their prices. Very affordable with so many different looks & styles. This is quickly becoming my go to store. And has been the sole cause of my starting to shop online more than in person. U cld say I've transitioned from in store shopping to online!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really like it, i love the clothes and everything you can find there. The quality of the clothes is really really good and I bought a lot of them. The quality of other things maybe is not the best, but for the prize is really good (you can also use coupon). I live in Italy and it took a week and a half to deliver the order so it's amazing. I advice it and say that personally I find it a huge site where you can buy clothes. You should try it, you won't regret!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Pretty smooth and no bugs! I never have problems with the app...its usually smooth sailing. The ads are a few secs when u look away and look back and the ad is gone and u can begging to shop. Prices are great as well as coupons when u catch them. I like how when u randomly check in u get points to use as money to shop and the reviews in my opinion takes a while and sometimes erases the entire review if u press something wrong. I do wish u can buy more than 1 flash item tho, I'm on a budget sho🤣"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The SHEIN point system is absolute BS. I have been consistent in checking in for the past three weeks and right before it get to the last two days with the most points given it restarts the whole week, like I missed a day. It's not even the same as it use to be either. Now you barely get anything. A year or so ago I would at least be able to get up to 10 to 12 hundred points within a month. Now it's trash."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Well I have to say the best application to buy online, very easy, alot of options, details are always there. Even the refund was smooth and easy. The best thing is that you collect points by writing your reviews then you use them as a discount in your next purchase in addition to a discount code...I really love it. Specially the application does not shut down unlike other experiences. My only concern is the agent help chat it ends so quickly and have to start a new one everytime with a new agent"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've only recently started using this app but I cannot fault it, it is so easy to navigate. I would recommend it. A few weeks on and I've received my clothes pretty quickly, they are quite good quality but the straight leg trousers I bought were actually wide leg which I never wear, I'll give them to charity. The little girls dresses were really well made, so pretty and fit perfectly. All in all a great shopping experience with loads of choice."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,There are loads and loads of clothes in shein but when I open any category I always see the same clothes every time. You need to keep refreshing with new stuff in the top because I get really annoyed seeing the same clothes all the time when I know there are several clothes out there which are never shown in the top. Rest the app is amazing
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is SOOOO good, like very cheap things, although one of the clothes i ordered ripped while opening the bag.... but everything else is mwah amazing"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Why are your prices increasing, but the quality keeps depressing? And how come the prices of the Bahrain site are double the ones in Saudi Arabia?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Latest update ruined how good the app was to use. We don't want easy access to add things to the cart. We want easy access to add it to favourites. That was the worse change. And the favourite page broke in the last update too and after a certain number it only shows the latest 100 favourites. That might sound a lot but when you go through multiple categories (such as kitchen supplies and stationery) it adds up to over 100 very quickly. Makes the favourites page useless. Pleeeease fix this
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Brilliant. Just discovered shein after a few of my friends telling me about it. At first I was a bit sceptical. Ok so I have to buy a size up to what I normally wear but that's ok. I have so far bought 5 dresses, 4 jumpsuits , some gifts for people and hair accessories. It is so easy to send unwanted items back and shein are very quick to refund monies back into your bank . I would recommend to anyone who is looking for something different to wear that is good quality and great prices"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very happy shopping with SHEIN. Almost all I now own is from SHEIN. SHEIN has exactly my style of clothes I like to wear. Great prices - even better with regular price drops and specials. I've made several orders since Xmas 2020 and all have arrived well packaged. Returned an item and whole process was easy and no stress. Highly recommend.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Shipping is obviously an issue but expected. Having a converted sizing for everything! Need to know u.s size charts on everything, shirts, pants, shoes! And having more house decor not just wall decorations. Small appliances would sell, prices aren't bad at all. Hope stuff comes with directions or instructions!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I get a lot of stuff from this app, being broke and living in California and all, and overall like the app. I'm kinda upset that they got rid of the feature where you can see which reviews ordered the same size on an item as you would though. Makes it harder to scroll through all the reviews just to find the few that got the size/item I'm looking to get, so I wish they'd bring that back"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Really great choice of every category. Well pleased with fit and prices.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's difficult to find information regarding returns, return fees etc. It's difficult to leave claims and feedbacks."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Just received my order a week earlier than promised! Everything looks exactly as in the photos. It is true to size and good quality. Thank you! Only two issues: The pants though fit perfectly everywhere, but all the waistbands are very tight in comparison. So make sure you measure your waist before ordering I odered the silicon nipple cups and there is only one in the packet! Since I have two breasts, I can't wear it!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been shopping with Shein now for some time, and so far it's been brilliant all the way, great prices, good quality and a huge range of products. The delivery times have improved greatly. Discounts running all the time on top of the reasonable prices, it's a win win situation. I'm a plus size girl as well, so it's good.... All.. The way round😁🤣💋"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Really easy to use app. Use the 'check in' to earn points that give you discounts on purchases. Great choice of clothes for all sizes.like the fact that when you select an item it also shows similar. Description could be better. Always check others reviews for item for helpful feedback. Prices are fantastic.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love shopping on there can find so much in terms of clothes, bags, homestuff, jewellery and so much more. Easy to navigate and there's always a coupon code to save some coin! Quick delivery as well and can track the order easily. I would always say it's worth ordering more than £35 for free delivery and always get shipping guarantee to cover yourself in case of any issues."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Once in a while, I get an item that's too small for me for the size I ordered, large. For the price I get the items, it's still a great deal. I just use it as a gift 🎁, disappointing though. One time my stuff got shipped back because they used US postal services and supposedly they tried to Deliver it when we were not home, so it got shipped back. I just reordered it and they redelivered it. Leave extra time For delivery, and check their mail they will notify you of this eventually."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So far everything has been good quality for cheap! I do suggest you look at items very good online and read descriptions as I bought dresses with seams down the front and back instead of on the sides and I don't particularly like that but had I looked good enough I would have noticed. Shipping times vary on whether the items are in a US warehouse or in China, and you may receive multiple purchases for one order. DO NOT CONFIRM DELIVERY UNTIL ALL ITEMS FROM THAT ORDER HAVE ARRIVED! Enjoy!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the items that you present and carry. It warms my heart that, you are carrying all sizes. Thank You!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely love SheIn! Really cute, unique clothes, jewelry, etc at pretty affordable prices. I also love that you can earn points just by checking in daily & it's converted into a discount off your purchase. It's normally 1-5 points per check-in but sometimes up to 10-15. Each point is worth a penny. So if you had 500 points that would be $5.00 off your purchase. They also often have sales/clearances & free shipping days! 🖤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, the best clothing app I've stumbled upon in my whole life! Hundreds and hundreds of selections and many discounts all the time! The quality in their products is also impressive. Download this instead of Wish! Believe me. Cheap clothing in reasonable prices and huge varieties! I've saved sooo much money after I got this app. And they include free shipping if your order is over 45 euros, and if you have a discount you don't pay shipping at all."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very bad, waiting for a return for more than 1 week, no one has been contacted yet. There is no proper contact point. Very bad service, this is the second time I'm facing this type of service."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Widest variety of clothes, accessories, lingerie, bags, shoes among other things a girl might want on this app. Items are very easy to find via their categories and the search function includes an image search option. Measurements are given for all clothing, which is a huge attraction to me, and everything is reasonably priced and good quality. Would 100% recommend!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This App is amazing. I get to apply for free things weekly. I've actually received a free shirt from them. It was top quality. I order from them. Everything is of amazing quality and let me tell you, the shipping is FASTER than anyone I've ever shopped from via the internet and or app. THANK YOU SHEIN FOR MAKING SHOPPING FUN FOR ME AND MY FAMILY MEMBERS! THERE'S HONESTLY A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is by far my favourite clothing website and I love the homeware and stationery too. The plus size clothing is trendy, fits well and the prices are amazing. Delivery does take a long time (a week or so usually) but if you know that in advance it's really worth the wait. Only warning I would give is ordering earrings. I've had some gorgeous ones, but most pairs are a lot bigger than they look kn the pictures and in some cases too big to wear."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is exactly like temu, and wish. Very risky, and they have ""offers"" if you invite people but no REAL person ever wins it. IT'S A SCAM!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I had cancelled a top because it did not fit me properly. But when during my return pickup there was an emergency and j was out of town. But my pickup person has cancelled it like I cancelled it from my end. Now the app isn't allowing me to return it back again and also it has lot of bugs . Stuck in one page that I am not able to return to other page. terrible experience
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is user friendly & most items are as advertised. I love shopping on Shein because of the many different stuff to choose from. Only issue is when my orders were delivered by Buffalo, they arrived in record time. But when they were delivered by Aramex, it was a nightmare."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,It's a great app it fits my family budget needs love the selection of clothing for my family as well.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"You can't get my size goth clothes this cheap. Yeah the quality is sometimes less than at places like Kohls, but unless you shell out $60 min for a piece @Torrid, you'll come to realize plus size clothes are rarely of good quality. Fast fashion is an issue, but the fact that they're turning out lots of designs means I can actually get a unique style @ the right size and price. Plus half the stuff I've gotten is honestly suprisingly good quality anyway! Quick shipping! The app itself is GREAT! A+"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is so cute.It's very fun,easy and worth it. The clothes are so cheap and other products are good quality, I check in every day to get points points are like money if you use it to buy your item/s it becomes cheaper! There are also fun games where you can win lots of points and this app is so smooth you can find anything you want.;)) and bonus for no ads."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I bought a lot of apparel in Shein... I really love all my purchases... I always thankful of the product. All are beyond my expectations... It's all awesome... Especially the dress... It's all a wow, wow, wow... What I also appreciate is the discount... Purchasing more, more points will be earned... The next purchase is no longer a purchase but it's just claiming a gift from Shein... It's really exciting... Another one is the size guide... Thank you for guiding us... I have an exact fit. Thanks."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Easy app, i like shein value. I just find sometimes the product reviews are either useful or completely random as people will post anything to get the points. I have not had any issues buying but remember it's value products not designer gear. I have had some that are surprising good quality for the cheap price. Accessories like hair accessories are excellent value and some make up products are great."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Checking each item for there individual measurements is a pain. A medium in one is and X small in another. Even when you filter by size it will pull up items which are out of stock which also takes forever. Delivery is good products are good but the app annoys me. Can't be in a rush. Home and beauty are great but clothing sucks so you need to take your time.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love it! Highly recommend. Great buys, always receive my orders on time or early, and so many different things to do on the app than just shop. Contests, exclusive offers, interactive live shows, earn points, etc. It's more than just a shopping app, it's like a community or large family."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Fab clothing, great plus size range! The photo reviews are absolutely brilliant. My only gripe is the lack of search options... like dress length in plus size so you can filter out mini for example, or shortie pjs. They make up their own descriptions and you just get lucky to find recommendations based on what you find. A few more search options and keywords and this would be 5 star!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app! There are many options to choose from, many accessories, clothing, and some things you wouldn't think would be on there. They also have iPhone cases and AirPod Cases, including room decorations. The reviews really help and by making a review you can get points. Sometimes the clothing measurements aren't correct, but most of the time they are & if they aren't the reviews always help. After I downloaded the app this is the only place I get clothing and jewelry from! I LOVE YOU SHEIN🖤🖤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"First time experience not the worst. One item had an incorrect size, despite stating the correct one and now the return has to be on my account even though the fault was not mine. Please make sure orders are checked thoroughly before leaving dispatch. I really like the items on offer but can't be discouraged because of such a mistake as size when it's stipulated during the purchase"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's okay just like shoppe apps and it's very affordable items
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Awesome app for shopping..it contains many unique things which attracts customers to buy plus it has attractive schemes nd games which helps the buyer to get a little discount on the stuffs they are purchasing..!! Quality ,material is always up to the mark.. sometimes there is delay in delivery..shein can focus on that !! Apart frm this it is my fav shopping app ever!! Love uh shein😚😚😚"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app! I love that when browsing you don't have to click 'next page', it's a continuous feed. I don't like the fact that you cannot choose your language, it automatically changes to the country/location language. I live in Portugal but speak English! It's frustrating!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I'm so piss off of this app for inviting my friends and did not count to my credit this app is scammer that why your Ng popular..
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Great masks. Some of the most breathable non PPE masks I've seen anywhere which I recommended to my friends. However, it's a very misleading company. They source directly from China although they say they have operations in the US. The quality of some products are so poor they won't let you review, especially if you returned the item. The parts with flaws and defects, especially flaws with written in English aren't displayed in the photo gallery. I am thankful for their no hassle return."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It was easy to make orders. Orders stayed in my shopping bag till I was ready to process. There constant discounts and special vouchers which made my goods cheaper. It was easy to make returns. There was always something new and discounted Most of the goods quality were good, value for money. Overall fantastic experience."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have been shopping here in Shein from the past 2 years and it has been a great experience finding everything that i want to wear. But the very disappointing stuff about Shein is that the refunds take a lot of time. Even more than a week. I wish if the refunds took a little lesser time. And more regrettably, I cannot even track my returns. I returned a stuff last Sunday and here it shows as "" return order not found"". I hope Shein fixes it soon. Shein be my fav shopping app so far."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Christmas shopping for clothes this year was a breeze. I was able to match up several outfits for my little ones and myself. I had several orders and I received several discount coupons, shipping cost was free, and shipping was expedited. I received my orders in 3-4 days and they all arrived before Christmas. All items I ordered was accounted for once receiving which I was worried about because each order contained 31 items each but Shein didn't let me down. They made sure my orders was correct."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm still relatively new to the Shein experience. To date, the clothing, makeup, home decor and health care items I've purchased have all met or exceeded my expectations. Shein has proven trustworthy and I'll even be doing some mail order holiday shopping this year. Thanks so much Shein, for being such an honest, top-notch retailer! It's awesome to have found such an all around dependable and fun establishment, right when I needed it the most!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Diverse products for a fair price. A little something for everyone to choose from. I'd give 5 stars if their product descriptions (and by association, the search engin) was a bit more specific. It can hard to find specific things by typing in on the search bar, but rather, you end up finding it after scrolling 2 miles on ""related products"" to something else you were looking at."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The only issue I've ever had is sometimes the pictures don't really accurately represent the clothes or materials (for example things ending up being see thru ever tho the picture doesn't show that) but the best solve for that I'd to hope someone reviewed it already. Aside from thay great app with great deals.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great shopping and the products are exactly what you purchase. But they need to improve on the customer service options. It's not a person you're talking to and that could be a little frustrating for some people. Other than that I love shopping on Shein cause it has quality products for the right price and that's why I shop and will recommend to anyone. That's why I gave it a 5 star rating. 🌟
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was a little weary at first but not anymore. I have bought things and returned thing with no problem at all. I think there great. So if your a little hesitant, don't be, there on time, and good quality. One thing is I ordered a jogging suit and I expected jogging suit material but it was a knit. I still loved it and very comfortable. A plus Shein !"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love Shein!!!!!! Once you understand their sizing everything goes alot smoother. The value for money is awesome. I wish that they would carry a larger size. I'm at the very top range of what they offer and the selection isn't as good for 5x. Also I'm technically a 6x . So I wish they would expand their sizing.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Be mindful that these products are from overseas and the delivery wait can be lengthy. You may try articles that specify that option and return what did not fit right. Item rating and description from customers available. Rate items and gain points twards discounts. Its a great interactive app. Everyone helps everyone. Support always available.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pleasantly surprised. Small variety, but what they do have they do quite well. I saw different l dozens of hoodies I wanted, and there seemed to be an endless amount. Best part is that i could buy everything I want, and even if that ends up being a shat ton, it still wouldn't break the bank. Cause the price is probably the best thing about it. Super affordable, and worth every penny."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app and company! I have purchased stuff for myself and others. If you do your measurements, everything fits! Great products for the price and some are unexpectedly better quality than expected! An example would be the sweaters I've purchased. Very quick shipping even though it comes from overseas."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Cothes are a bit thin in the fabric and sizing is all over the place, but when you find a good fit it's wonderful. Wish they did free returns so one could try things on; I've had to keep a few items that don't fit (too large). However: I love love LOVE Shein Curve bathing suits. I've lived at the beach my whole life and never had swimsuits I felt confident in until I found Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Shein's a great app, there's just so much stuff! Though I wish that there was a way instead of just using boards to create outfits that we could use ""create an outfit"" for events but for just personal use? Like, instead of publishing a collage of items to make an outfit for an event, I there should also be an option where you just keep the outfit to yourself. I really don't want to have to download another app to do that sort of stuff LMAO"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is very glitchy. Some poducts such as some dresses, skirts and lingerie do not fit as displayed. I even measured myself prior to my purchase. However, the sizing is off for this type of product. Returns are also a pain. This makes me less inclined to order from their website. IT IS HONESTLY A GUESSING GAME WITH ORDERING CLOTHES FROM SHEIN! Either the product is cheaply made or the sizing is off in comparison to what is put on the website."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Fairly new to Shein, have kept most items. Seems to have good quality swimwear and workout wear. Shipping is fast and my one return was fast and efficient. Definitely worth a look...esp when free shipping is offered👍 Been a few months and have ordered so much. Quite impressed with their service...return process is fast and easy. Great company and recd for sure💕"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"SHEIN IS THE BEST!! Very inexpensive items with good/great quality. I love the daily discounts, and the daily ""check in"" that give you points towards more discounts. Also I'm a Plus size woman and the selections they have for us are PHENOMENAL. Just make sure to read reviews before purchasing, some items run big and some run small. But everything they have is great, from kids, pets, accessories, and shoes!!! Also shipping is a fair waiting period and usually arrives before the delivery date."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app because it is so good and also really fun this app helps me with shopping and it also make me stay at home just picking what I can buy that you so much shein:)
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love shein! My wardrobe has NEVER been bigger!! 😁😁 Shein always has amazing deals and clearances on everything from clothes to home decor. I love the variety of styles of clothes and the size options are usually a perfect match, but know your measurements. Shipping can sometimes take a little while longer than you would want but with the deals you get and the coupons you can add its completely worth the wait. I would recommend this app to anyone! Love love love it!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this app! Very user friendly and easy to navigate. I love that I am able to filter and narrow down to exactly what I am looking for in size, style, color, etc. and there's so many options. Shipping has been fast and most times arrives earlier that quoted. Prices are great too. As with any online shopping use sizing charts, read details and reviews and you will be happy!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely brilliant! App itself is easy to set up and navigate, products are baseline decent quality at their worst going right up to stunning. My teenage daughter loves all her new clothes, accessories and homewares like cushions! We have the app on both our phones so we can add things we like to our basket (logged into same account) then veto anything either doesn't like. Returns are simple, usually fantastic delivery times too!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have shopped with SHEIN a few times now and always had a good experience! App works very good and easy to navigate. Lots of discounts too. Just seem to buy stuff then all the items are on sale so bit annoying! But other than that it's been working all good. Haven't used returns yet so not sure how easy it is to do that!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,so easy to use and tons of products to choose from. what i love most is the points system bc it can really help a lot to minimize the amount you spend you can find tons of vouchers online as well and there's free shipping every week. the only downside is the shipping time but it's still worth it bc of the quality. overall i really love this app!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Long delivery was mad over shien , now it's almost a month that in waiting for my order.. it has been in South africa since the 28th November amd still hasn't been delivered to me.. that is what i like like about shein the fast delivery. But now it's hopeless."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,All items are unique and affordable 💜
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Such a great app from the assortment of items to shipping! Everything is great! I especially enjoy (depending on how much you have in your bag/cart) you can use a coupon for every purchase! Aside from Shein's clothes, I've become obsessed with another brand on this app called DAZY. They have such great quality clothes along with more modest options (I prefer to not wear skimpy clothes, especially during fall and winter...)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein has good quality products that mostly in my experience fit through to size. Some might run small at times. But because of the quality they offer and the easy return service available to US residents, I will stick with them. I recommend it to everybody. The prices are unbeatable!🥰"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I love shopping with Shein but their recovery/problem solving process is horrible! My package somehow got lost and I was asked if I wanted to reorder my items. I said yes because I do understand inprocess shipping is out of their hands. I asked if my order could be expedited at no extra charge due to the inconvenience and they said no. I asked if I could pay the extra fee for express shipping since they were putting in a new order and they said no. Not good customer service in my opinion.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I haven't had a bad experience , everything I've ordered has come in on time or early . Everything is what I expected for the cost. Sizes are around what I thought , but reviews are always great to check. Lots of girls leave reviews with pictures and details, which helps cut down on the guessing! Cute stuff at good prices :)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am really shocked by how professional this company is! I ordered many items, there was a mistake in 2 items. I decided to refund. They immediately sent the curriour to take the rejected items and was refined in couple of days. Everything eas systematics, fast. Their variety of products and value for price is amazing. Definitely will always shop from there."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"So I've received all of my orders and I have to say, so far I'm very satisfied with all of the pieces I've bought! I have to rate 4 stars cuz shein tracking ain't really up-to-date which isn't good for those who buy from this apps for the 1st time. Customer service is so hard to reach just like others have said whether through the apps or email. Overall I'm satisfied. It's a bit odd how my previous reviews keep disappearing from this shein apps though～"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It is a good shopping app and has everything for cheap 😁.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love it!!! Everything was as it looked, with exception that I purchased a little bigger than normal but colthing fits very true to size. Which was great to know for my next purchase. Shipped and arrived when expected; plus I adored the packaging, very nice and neat! Presentation counts 😉 Overall I had a great 1st time experience and already recommended to family and friends! Oh....Did I mention the prices and sales are unbeatable; especially for the quality of clothing & swim wear! ❤😍👌"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I really like this online store and their affiliate called Boowho. They have fairly good prices most of the time the only thing that bothered me was in the beginning when I first started ordering is that I thought I was ordering two-piece jogging suits and then all the sudden only three pairs of pants the bottom showed up because the tops were not included but it wasn't clearly written so I had to spend double the money I thought I was going to get just to get the matching tops..not cool
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Please enable SD storage. Thanks
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have had the most incredible experience with Shein. I have been shopping with them for almost a year, and have Never had any problems. All my items I have bought have been perfect every time. I have even recommended them to my friends whom also love their clothing and accessories. Would highly recommend. xxxx"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm LOVE this app!! The prices are phenomenal! The quality is great! Most importantly they have EVERYTHING I need! Cutest styles for my kids, any & all looks for me, beauty products, home decor, the list goes on!! & there's a ton of reviews on each item, which is super important to me especially when buying clothes online. I promise you won't be disappointed.."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Better than wish in most ways. Cheaper than Amazon but lacks some user features. Sizes on clothing is all over the place so make sure to check measurements. No way to filter on measurements, only on randomly determined sizing. Overall, price and quality are lower than Amazon or other established stores. App works without any noticeable flaws, just lacking some features."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Igor to order and it says check my cart number of things I have and there won't be anything there so I shut it down and I like alot of your stuff but if you can't order what's the sense in looking at it
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"lots of choices when adding to bag and accurate sizing. basically very specific choices not like other shopping apps who dont put sizing charts. photo search also very nice!!, only 4 stars because sometimes when you pay first your order doesnt come at all, waste of money, time, coupons and points. they give free points a lot which is just 💕💕. tracking your parcel isnt very accurate but out of all clothes shopping apps this is my fave. although i wish they could make more non-revealing clothing"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It is really a good app ..it has nice trendy collection..but I don't like the return policy which u have.. like literally paying $65 on every item u return is nonsense in fact all most half the money would go when the refund is initiated at least for exchange it should be free like other apps u always can't get it right with measurements as it differs from one to one..and also their is no much collections in accessories,jewellery,shoes,bags so do restock it as soon as possible."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app. Honestly, I was sceptical at first buying clothes so cheap and online, but I was so surprised. The quality is better than I expected, the prices are amazing and postage is fast. The reviews are really helpful to work out sizing if things are made small or larger than normal, and they have photos of products being worn."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Not good. I placed an order and the tracking information shows its been delivered to a mailbox. I have tried contacting the company numerous times each time attaching photos of my order , order number and tracking information, not once have anyone replied to me. Take your money and don't receive the goods."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Does not let me return my packages and didn't give me an option to send them to do an exact location
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I enjoy looking and seeing what I might like to buy and have bought a few items from Shein. The only thing I gave up on was the free trial as I applied multiple times and have never successfully been chosen to trial and review items so disappointed in this part as I have left reviews for the items I ordered. Would like the opportunity to have ago at the free trial. I do love the items Shein has to offer and look forward to purchasing more.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein doesn't only offer affordable clothing but there are also affordable house accessories including pet accessories, and what is more interesting is that if you see a style somewhere you can just take a picture and use it to search for the same style in Shein app sometimes they have exactly what you search for but other times you find either same design or fabric. I love this app you get to check in everyday and earn points that you can use on your following purchase as a discount,"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Always easy to use and huge selection of different products at very reasonable prices. Shipping time isn't bad considering it's shipped from overseas. Love the discount coupons - saves you loads of money. Returns are no hassle and money refunded fairly quickly. Also, I like the points you can earn by checking in daily and reviewing items. ❤️ this app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Too slow on delivery, it's 12 days now and still haven't received my order, I'm uninstalling this app as soon as I receive them 👎"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love how customers help out by taking pictures and giving you their body measurements. That really helps me so I can get an idea of how something might fit my body shape or size. Not many companies offer free return and honestly that's the main reason I chose to buy from Shein. It's difficult sometimes to get the size right every time online and they just make returns so easy. They package everything so nice. Just a great company all together. Good Job Shein! 🥰
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Pretty good experience!! Love everything on the app, okay shipping, and cheap and good quality items. Some things are a bit uncomfty to wear but other than that I love shein. I've easily spent a lot money but I'm happy with everything I've received. Easy returns and love that there is coupons and the points program avaliable!! Totally recommend for kids/teens and adults. Also love that there is makeup and home items. Only down side is that sometimes the in-app package tracker is wrong!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's amazing!!! The only complain I have is whenever I want to buy tights or leggings they don't have many skin tone colors to choose of they only have a super light skin tone color or black but other than that I don't have any complaints this is the best shopping app ever I have ordered a couple of times and my order is perfect and it's everything that I was expecting💗✨
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is great but the contests are won based on likes which means no matter how good your outfit or show is, you have to beg for likes from fellow contestants to win. It is a waste of time for everyone, especially judges. It would be better if contestants voted on their peers outfits or shows to narrow it down to a true ""best of the best"" winner scenario (like covet game app). Fix this and more people will come on app and stay on it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Always something new and affordable! Coupons are stored on/in the app in your inbox/messages including the expiration date. Some coupons have free shipping with items totaling $29 or more. Very good quality, check elasticity when ordering plus sizes, some clothing fits loser because of the 'stretch' or give in the material."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Have done two huge hauls so far and things are a hit or miss with the quality. Great prices and point rewards. Only thing I don't like is the very obvious photoshop on some of the models. Backgrounds warp around the stomachs, shoulder and just all over sometimes. Just show the models for who they are. I notice the PS more on the women section and not the curve plus(unless it's lingerie then it's there sometimes too) but yeah cute clothes, fast shipping and points!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is very straight forward and easy to operate. You have a wishlist amd cart so you can seperate what you want from what you're actually going to buy. Everything is so inexpensive, yet not cheap in quality. There are reviews for each product as well as pictures to see how they fit. I personally love the size meter thay tells you if the item fits small, large, or just right. I wasn't disappointed !!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I reccommended this app to my cousins because the product is really dope but it's really upsetting because they never experienced the hassle of delivery process when we live in the same city and barangay. I would understand the delay of delivery if we're experiencing the same but no! It only applies to me, they always have smooth transaction while I always need to contact customer service!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I made my 1st purchase from Shein about 3 wks ago. I REEEALLY LIKE EVERYTHING except ONE item (a pair of pants that were supposed to look like jeans but turned out to look like a hedious curtain cut and sewn into a pair of pants.) Instead of sending them back or turning them into multiple rags for cleaning or something, I'll probably end up cutting them into patches and using them as underlayers for actual jeans. Overall I'm SO pleased with the other 30+ items! I've already started my next order"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I enjoy shien. Getting correct size can be tricky but good products that arrive in two weeks. I can shop for gifts for family or for myself. Shien has lots of options. It is harder to find bigger girl clothes in some outfits Would recommend to family and friends on a budget. My kids even enjoy scanning through all the Halloween fun at the moment. I would like to know about shipping products to other people. That would be helpful. All in all shein is a good useful and cheaply prices goods. Enjoy
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I can say that delivery service is on time but when it comes to quality of products won't be recommended. The styles are beautiful when you see the photos on app but physically it's not exactly the same. I got 4 pairs of shoes and only 1 is not bad. Three of them has stains and the packaging are so bad! Well, what do you expect for a cheap price?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The best app!😍 I have almost 10 shopping apps in my phone..""Shein"" stands top most.. The best shopping app ever! Awesome deals, daily sales, points and many more.. More over cloth quality is very very good... It looks as it is shown in the picture!😚 100% recommended! Trust me u will only go with shein If once experienced.. Great experience ❤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I think it is a good app. The shipping fee's cost may be ridiculous at times because you'd pay triple the price of what you're purchasing, which discourages one to make a purchase. Overalls the best just work on the shipping fee and atleast the time it takes for it to be delivered."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I highly recommend giving the Shein app a try if you're looking for an app that has a huge selection of the most up to date and stylish clothes, shoes & accessories that you don't see everywhere else for a reasonable price! Shein has a little something for any and everyone. The items I've ordered are always shipped and received on time!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Just got trouble in my check in points why you only given me 1 to 2 points every day for checking in for 7 days?? And customer service is fix we can't complain or anything about .. but anyways still enjoying shopping 🛍 😌
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I think the app should have the option to chose any language despite where you're from. I only know the name of certain items in English but the only language available for me is portuguese because I live in portugal. And I think the in-store navigation should be less confusing, there's too many adds and it generally feels unorganized. All of the rest is fine."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I regularly buy in Shein since it's a really trusted platform.But in my latest order 5 of my item were missing in the package. I contacted the customer service and was told no item were missing as per the CCTV and advised to contact the logistics. Only 1 tracking number was given and delivered according. They should check with the shipper. If it's shipped separately they should provide me the tracking no. But they pushing this issue around and my money gone now. It's really very disappointing.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,So far best online shopping application ever! I did my first purchase and it was an amazing experience. Very Good quality materials .now I am about to do my 2nd purchase and I'm so excited! I love the way they show how to pair the dress with matching shoes and ornaments through this way we can easily purchase the whole set and get amazing looks. #Highly recommended!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I can say that this app is the best among the other OS app I use. I can't say anything about their products. Everything are just the same as the pictures. But this past days, even though I already received my order. They keep contacting me and asking for my location again and again. And the purchase is just the same as the items I already received. I cancel it multiple times but still receiving calls and messages from them."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really love the app, great choices and lots of thing to shop for, has great prices so low and awsome the only thing i think is wrong with it is not having has many name brand things, but other then that it a great place to shop, and a tip for when you download always read the reviews to see if it runs small or big and how its made and feels."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's amazing! Great prices, good clothes, accessories, swimsuit, household items and more... Good shipping service, I have never had problems with any package. Full recommended! I love the modification of being able to put what I want in the bag and then select only what I'll buy in the moment. 100/100"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very Very bad, my order got missing from Buffalo logistics. I didn't get refund from Shein and Buffalo or replacement of items"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love the free shipping option especially on weekends and they have exceptionally low prices. What I don't like is the products are random... one item could be a random choice of different colors or designs. I would like to choose what I want and pay for it.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is definitely worth ordering from, my daughter and I have order 4 or 5 times and have always gotten our orders in a timely manner, everything was great quality, looked as it did in the pictures, and was all true to size! Not just clothing there is women's, women's plus, men's, kids, household, pets and so much more. Earning points with the daily check in is a fun and easy way to earn money towards your purchases!! Plus lots of other things to check out to get involved and earn points!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Only giving 3 stars because of the shipping issue ive had. I chose to go with expedited shipping which is 2-4 business days. What they dont tell you until later is that there is also a 1-3 day processing wait time. So the things i ordered didn't come in time and need to be returned being there is no use now. So all in all 2-4 day shipping takes generally a week.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Free Gifts game I'm completed but not showing in processing what can I do
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I made 3 separate orders of 6 items in each one and you then split the orders. I've recieved one item from each order but it won't let me clarify this on the app. If one item is received you will only let me write reviews on the whole order when it hasn't all arrived. Kinda frustrating. The clothes I have received are very nice and they fit which is a bonus (short legs with bigger hips lol) the sizing guide and others reviews are great but the app could do with a contact us button for starters.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love all the options... To much too choose from. WARNING: please be aware that shopping on shein is so totally easy and amazing.. That it is extremely addictive. And if you are in South Africa and sceared of import cost. I have orderd many times and by an averof R85 import cost every time. But thie it items and clothing is so cheap that I am happy to bay it. 😍👌💕
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I think this is a really good app and i love it so much, but I don't like how they don't have plus sizes of the same clothes for skinnier women. I also don't like how when you buy a top and bottom you cant pick different sizes for the oufit. Realistically not everyone fits the same size in bottoms and tops. It's not fair to have to but two oufits to be able to wear one."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Easy to use. Fast and convenient. Easy to find your orders and 'loved' products. I haven't had any problems or issues. Only improvement would be to get less notifications because i don't shop a lot: if you buy frequently the notifications have great deals and you'll want them.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I like the clothes from here and majority of the time they fit great bit there are times that the sizing is completely off. The shoe sizing is NEVER correct. I wear a 10 and have been wearing the same size since I had my daughter and when I buy shoes they are either too small or too big depending on the shoe. Very disappointed because the shoes are a good price.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The pictures of the clothes and sizes are accurate. The delivery is fast and professional. I am a regular and I've only returned two items because I accidently ordered the same item more than once. The return was easy, and my money was returned quickly. I am now ordering Christmas gifts for the office I work for. Prices are always reasonable. The quality of all items is good. To say I love Shein is an understatement. The Shein app is the cherry on top."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So many super cute, and surprisingly high quality items. I've bought myself and my daughter a lot of really cute clothes since I started using this app. I was stuck on wish until I discovered shein. Their prices are just as good, their shipping is lower, and the risk of getting something poorly made or falsely advertised is extensively lower from my experience. 100% reccomened this app to anyone with a tight budget that wants to have nice clothes and decor."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely love Shein. It never disappoints. The clothes are always true to size, great quality, unique and fashion forward styles for awesome prices! Free and easy returns too, so I'm never scared to try something new, lots of perks, easy to use, fast shipping! I love love love Shein!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My go to app. Especially when I have special occasions to attend to. I love the fit and the quality. But what I love the most about SHEIN that no other shopping app have is the points system and the vouchers! They're for real! You can can get a deduction of 200 or more off your total bill. The points, the vouchers from games and the ratings you give after each purchase is awesome! 👍👍👍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have tried to register to this apps for so long but always comes out with sorry, system upgrading! So annoying!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Wish is cheaper but i thought shein would deliver faster as they charge more but the last 3/4 times ive been waiting forever so im considering going back to wish
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Just had a support issue and was able to get it taken care of quickly through the app. I've been shopping with Shein for a while online, the app makes my shopping experience easy. I especially like the feature where I can remove an item from my viewing(ie: I purchased already, or it isn't my style), it refines my search."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"LOVE! If you want to have a great experience with Shein, read reviews! TAKE YOUR BODY MEASUREMENTS. You can find others with similar measurements, weight, and even body type if there are pictures included! Also READ THE MEASUREMENTS OF EVERY SINGLE ITEM. When you click on a size, the measurements for that particular item in that particular size will show up, making it easier to choose the right size for YOU. Work smarter, not harder (ie. get it right the first time to avoid returns and refunds)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,So far so good. Cheap prices and good quality clothes. I've had good experiences with Shein so far. I would blindly recommend it to anyone. But the only problem is why does the free shipping price pops in if I add the points ? The points somehow become not much of use. But overall it's a good one.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Absolutely love it! My favourite place to buy clothes from. Very good quality and always reliable. My only problem is a the delivery.. Take like 2 weeks to get the stuff I ordered. But if I plan ahead it doesn't matter as I wouldn't be able to find such amazing things for such a good price elsewhere.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They don't care if the user is maybe driving and using google map, if the user is doing something important on the phone, or if the user is maybe playing games, nah they'll close the app you're using and show up on your screen, they opened the app for me 3 times while I was driving and I had to uninstall it, I liked it before but I swear im never gonna download it ever again."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Items arrive in damaged state due to ridiculous way they are packaged. Customer service is completely useless.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Please bring back the original system of Shein. Be fair to the customers because not all clothes has the same quality. Let us use 50℅ of the points. Thanks!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love SHEIN! Great selection of clothing, you can find anything you want. Majority of the time the clothes are good quality and very reasonable price. There are always offers and sales; collecting SHEIN points also saves money. The delivery is quick and you can easily track your package which is a nice service. Also, the return process is easy and very fast, got my refund within a couple days of return. SHEIN is definitely my go to online shopping store!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I had never used Shein because I thought it was like WISH. I was wrong! I ordered some tights from them after reading the reviews. They came much faster than I thought they would (2 weeks), and the quality was much better than I expected. Now it's cheap fast fashion, but it's not bad at all. If you need some cheap clothing, I highly recommend this app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Love the products but the app needs improvement. I had 21 items in my cart, and my order only processed 10 items and left the others behind. It doesn't say out of stock. When trying to use my points, it took away free shipping even though order was over $50. Also, the reference code goes away after so long and has to be added back to profile."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm new to this site but I'm pretty satisfied with it so far. There is a lot of clothing to choose from and are all really affordable. However it does come with hit or misses quality wise. The shipping is also not very long (considering my first order before this pandemic was received 11 days after purchase) and the packaging is pretty standard, putting each piece in plastic zip bags. Customer service doesn't usually respond unless you comment under their latest instagram post about your order."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,My new favorite app to shop on! Endless choices with great updates for your order shipment. Easy to view items via app. Great pruces. My only warning when ordering from Shein is to definitely read the product sizing & material content info. I first ordered sizes way too big because i thought theyd run small but my sister was happy to get all the shirts id ordered. Returns can be a bit of hassle compared to local shops & amazon. Shipping takes up to a full month. But worth the wait
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've been using shein for about 3 months now and really have enjoyed the entire experience so far. I've placed 4 orders and have loved everything. The only thing I don't care for is the Live notifications there's to many and tbh the lives are really annoying and do nothing. FYI always read the reviews when buying they are really transparent which makes getting what you want easy.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very user friendly. I have fallen in love with Shein! Already 2 orders in 2 weeks! Very affordable quality clothing. And the discounts they offer are great. Update 2.2021 Been using this app nearly 3 years now and its still wonderful! Shein is sooo much better than fashion nova and boohoo. If you know how to online shop, you wont be disappointed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Poor quality products...cheap n fall apart...very flimsy n poorly made. Also shipping takes forever from overseas
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My evil friends... I love this so much I have found my favorite online store. The quality is great for the prices you pay, it arrives withing a week 2 max. Individually packed in plastic bag. The bags are recyclable, I can't remember the number of recycling code but I feel less guilty. No weird smells in tour products and the tracking system is fantastic. Beware! Once you try it you will get hooked and in love with everything SHEIN has to offer, prices contests, free clothes. ❤❤❤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,.the cloths are very nice but the shipment is expensive to us learners who don't have money
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I had a great experience overall.My orders were delivered on time, even faster in some cases. I really love everything I ordered. The fact that people post their orders and you can see their experiences with the products it's really amazing. Also, another great feature is that we are in contact with the status of the delivery which gives you a confort that the products will come on time and its safe. I'm really glad that I discovered this platform, happy to use it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love shein!! Such cheap clothing and the delivery to uk takes 1 week! The clothing is amazing and really good quality! Very trendy too haha. If you check in every day you can get points which you use to get money off products! This is my go-to shop for literally everything😻. Also there is a ""free trial"" section so if you click there you can possibly win a free prize! I personally havent won anything yet but one day you never know! 👍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love SHEIN! So many ways to get items for lower price. Always offering different coupon codes, you can use a reference code, earn points to use for purchases and so many others. Before ordering anything read the reviews! 👇 Below google asked to rate ads shown in app. SheIn doesn't have ads in app! Which is great. No distractions from shopping!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love shein amazing clothes and accessories the only thing I hate is when you can't find cute plus sized pants or shirts usually it's just a plain shirt or as words on it, me personally I would want to see thag change where we can get the same experience as other people, like the grunge look for plus sized or street wear that type of Stuff. Overall it's a great app"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I thought this was a fake app but a friend told me I should try it. I have had a lot of success with quality for price. Just need to read and measure yourself and family. Only things for me are, I wish they had Plus size men's clothes too, sometimes the items smell funny, but are easily washable, undergarments are not exactly correct in sizing and you can't return them even if unworn."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a very easy app to use overall, from scrolling through products to making payment. Usually if an app is too complicated, i lose interest. But i absolutely love it. And a plus point is the free points and vouchers. Please add more vouchers cause more savings, means more buying. But i dont have any complaints!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, it makes authentic shopping very easy. I'm so satisfied with all the items I've purchased and recommend it to all who love shopping from home to benefit of amazing discounts and coupons. I wish shipping could take less time, 14 days to deliver the item is too long."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Cute clothes at great prices, but SO MUCH more! I have started paying more attention to the Shein gals program with its multiple opportunities to earn points in different ways. It's fun to do, especially the outfit contests. I'm an adult and it's almost like slumber party in middle school fun, in a good way! I've ordered some clothing for my daughter. Mostly pajamas and they're excellent. I just ordered a rug for the bathroom and I'm excited about it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Pretty easy to navigate through this site and they've made it very fun to shop online indeed! And this is coming from someone who avoids online shopping like the plague. So far have bought a few items from thee and have to say that they've come through very professionally all the way so far, from clothing quality, value for koney and expediting and packaging your orders very well and intact."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Usually very good items, some are a miss but it's infrequent. Always great prices for what you get! Most of my clothes lately are from shein. Definitely a great way to get cute jammies and change out old clothes for a cheap price. That's where I started and I love that most people leave comments about sizing and material so you can decide if you want to order based on real customer feedback"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Love Shein. Always discount and items are of good quality! Some products I would want but its not available on Shein.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Please REMOVE th URGENT DELIVERY button it is not required.. so for this reason I now only rate you a 2.. th previous PACKAGE RECEIVED is much more acceptable change this and I'll change my review. Sometimes.. less is more
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love shein before,but now a li'l bit hate it because whenever i make more points,it becomes smaller and smaller the day after. Like, what the heck! Where are my points???"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pretty cool app. Tried some clothes, read the fine print of the materials, because some are itchy or too thin of material for me. The pajamas I've gotten are pretty nice and comfy. I bought a size up because of my chest size. The duvet cover I got was so smooth and amazing. It matched exactly what the photo was. 📸 Love that, I can shipped stuff back with no hassles too."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love this app, great for fast fashion, and the prices are phenomenal! There is a massive range in clothing and home and living supplies. I am possibly a little bit addicted 🤫🙃. I only have 1 request, which is to add a feature, where you can shuffle the order of your cart. This would just make it easier to stay organized. Thank you so much for this app, love it! 😊"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Was a ok app at the beginning, finding what cloths best suit your figure was ok, however when returning items, alot of these want missing, even if you use there very own label. I have had 32 items go missing and NOT BEEN REFUNDED FOR. I have proof of posting. 32 items went missing. So be careful in using this app. Cloths look nice, some are not as nice as the pictures, not as long, or as flattering. The leggings ate ok. Fluffy jumpers ok. Service is shocking. I will not be using any more"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have tried to order of this shockingly bad website, and I am still waiting for my order, They are Christmas present, and a week before, still nothing. Customer service is a joke. No help at all. DO NOT USE"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app is fine. It's user friendly and I ♥️ when apps have a wishlist and payment options. The products are cute & delivered quickly. My problem with Shein is that I send most of it back because the sizes are wrong. I always read the sizing chart & measurements of each item very closely. I measure kids/myself before I place my order. My last order was 33pieces and had to return 20! 😲 What a bummer for the birthday girl. Plus I have to pay for the return shipping. Only 1st return is free!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Checking out was a Real Problem! I tried to CHECK-OUT over 4 times and it knocked me out every time. I finally saw that I was Charged for one and had another one Processing and had another one I was currently Trying to Order. I finally Downloaded the App and then I had no Problems. The Website is Horrible, needs alot of improvement. The App was a Great experience... definitely one to Watch and Use."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love shein! They have amazing wall decor, kids clothing, beanies, toys and makeup and so much more for decent prices!! Ofcourse always always read the reviews and sizing. Personally, clothing for myself are a hit or miss with quality wise, but clothing for my little one are always amazing quality. Highly recommend to give it a look. Always found something super cute to decorate my son's room."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love how SHEIN is reasonably priced & it makes purchasing a lot more affordable; not just that, I would say 95% of their items are of good quality! So far, their customer service & refunds are prompt, even the whole platform together with its point system is easy to use & access. Not forgetting to mention how I really love their pick-up service for returns, it's so convenient, accomodating & thoughtful. The whole package that comes with SHEIN, I am just so grateful for it. Thank you SHEIN."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is easy to use. Most icons for interacting with the app are to the bottom of the screen. The only issue for me is when u select an item the user interface icons disappear and u have to go backwards to locate it again. Other than that with time u get a handle on the app. Not forgetting good deals and the app shows u this as well.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The clothes are mostly great. Thing is, it takes forever to arrives. I am still waiting for stuffs that I ordered more than a month ago. I made a order with quick delivery and they separated it in two parcel and charged each delivery 25$ making it 50 more than the fast delivery price I already paid. This is... intense and bad. It is sad because the clothes looks good."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Worst app ever. first of all the delivery was so late, and they sent a defective piece, and now that I want to return the order they say that I won't get my money in my account but the wallet, why would I want to keep my money in your app when I don't want to shop from your app anymore? I am trying to contact customer service but all the numbers are invalid, even the email ID is invalid.. this app is nothing but a big scam."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like the vast selection of items them have. I think the time in which items reach me is good for how far my items have to travel to get to me, but I do wish it was closer. The clothes size is some times a guess for me. The price is good so I typically take the chance and if things do work out I just give it away lbvs."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall the app is really easy to use! My one complaint would be that, even if you have selected a certain part of the store you want to be on (such as Curve or Plus), the app will not allow you to search specifically within that area."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein! Some of the items are thin, or seem low quality. HOWEVER, the price is extremely low so what do you expect for 5 bucks? Whenever I order things, there's rarely bad items (I love it all!). When you order clothing, make sure you check the size chart! People always claim things are too small, but they failed to check the specific measurements."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Absolutely Love it. The prices are affordable. They have a lot of cute things and wide selection. I love that you can see how each item looks on someone by their reviews. You cannot just go on this app and but one thing. Everytime I get on the app I end up with a cart full.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love shein. They have such unique bits. Besides the point that they have a bit of a negative reputation, improvement can also be made in the search engine, for example, using key words and then it popping up. Instead of getting random general results."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"So far, I'm loving the app. It's interfaces are good, does not lag and is easy to navigate. The only thing I'd like to have is the ability to contact whoever we're buying the items from, as well as the rider. Also, the tracking system (like majority of the people here said) needs an improvement. We can't even see where are orders are, we're just informed about it being shipped, delivered, etc."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Affordable quality fashion e-commerce. Exceptional cool designs where you can't find elsewhere. The only issue is probably sometimes the quality and the size is less accurate than our usual body size measurement even it has display the size chart. If only they have live chat just in case we need to ask about the items.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very awesome! I love the class and styles offered. I enjoy all the products offered. Very, very nice."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Gets update on a regular basis, tracking made easy to follow the status of the package. Excellent."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Super cheap clothes and products that are great. However I am annoyed by the cart. Once you are set yo imput your credit card number if you go back to put in your code to save some money or to add something you forgot it cancels your order. I did not want to cancel my order but it is annoying to have to add everything back. You guys should really work on your app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Wonderful collection they have and though the products come from china through the Indian Customs faced no problem with orders. They have started a mens collection too which is again awesome. Would definitely recommend the app to everyone. About sizes of dresses one must look at there size chart and decide the one for oneself. Customer reviews for any product also helps a lot in deciding. All round great app for buying clothes online
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"They have very cute apperal, home decor, and many more. Some things could use more description, but sometimes you just have to look at the reviews. Their delivery time is on point,haven't had any issues so far. All of my delivery have been early, easy to get points, and well designed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like this app but will uninstall next holiday season. I'm getting notifications like every 15-30 minutes and I've tried to turn them off multiple times, not including their hundreds of emails. It's driving me nuts. I'll be reinstalling this in January, lol. The constant ads do NOT make me want to browse and purchase"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Overall great experience, I was very skeptical at first. I've read mixed reviews but I find that as long as you do your research on the product with measurements it seems to be fairly accurate. Just did a 12 item order and was not disappointed with sizing. I may have to return one or two things but the dresses fit fantastic. I based my ordering the dresses directly off measurements of myself vs typical US sizes. The men's clothes definitely need expanding, not accurate US sizes."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Felt as though I saw the same products multiple times as I scrolled. I would like more variety and options, as well as more sizing options for clothing. I am very pleased with the reviews and how helpful they are for sizing and quality questions."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm usually very skeptical about apps and websites like Shein. But after trying it out and ordering some stuff, there is nowhere else I'd rather buy my clothes from!!! I am addicted to finding great deals on stuff that is actually my style. I even had a good experience with the returns process. My refund was super fast! I really do recommend this store, especially if you are plus sized like myself. This store will have you out looking fly af, I promise!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is the best app for clothing, accessories and my more. Shein offers good clothing at an affordable price. Personally I love Shein... I've also got my mother on board with me on this train. I also shared the app with friends, they loved it. The fabric is great, most come in their accurate sizes. The delivery has never given us problems. I just love everything about the app... There aren't many ads and the app is clear and very easy to use."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I loved Shein but here recently they try and manipulate people into sharing their link to try and get new users with the promise of winning rewards, however Ive shared the link with family and friends and it doesn't work properly, also there is no place to type in a referral code as a new user so the promise of a reward is all very fake and to try and promote their brand. Sketchy business practice."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love all the plus clothes huge selection great prices and they have a lot of tie dyed stuff which I really like the only thing I don't like is that it keeps coming up on my main screen the advertisement a thin bar at the bottom of my phone it causes me not to be able to do a lot of things on my phone so product awesome on your advertisement it needs a tone back just a bit every time I pick my phone up I don't want it to tell me to buy a shirt.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"SHEIN never disappointed me. All my orders arrive earlier than expected. The app is very user friendly. I am happy with SHEIN. There was a time I wanted to pay using PayPal and the only option was debt card but I've notice you have PayPal in South Africa. And I love how you have upgraded your app, especially the part where I can be able to easily add to cart other items the models are wearing with what I was initially interested in before. Thank you SHEIN for the best service."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've ordered a few times and everytime I've had a great experience. The clothes are made of great quality. Also it's very easy to find what your looking for and the deals are great. Everytime that i have ordered the delivery was very fast,always sooner then expected. Which is great. I highly recommend you shop at SHEIN!!! They have way more then just clothes. Just check them out you'll see."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app just makes it that much easier and organized! I've ordered from Shein at least 20+ different times! Beautiful clothes and jewerly, spa and beauty items are wonderful and the makeup is gorgeous! Plus it doesnt hurt when the items are so low in price AND no shipping over a certain amount AND tons of coupons! Customer for life 😁"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I cant collect points anymore. If click the ""check in"" only white backgroud is shown. So disappointing"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I loved both the app and the site but lately it has become super frustrating. When about to complete my order I get an error saying ""the following products cannot be shipped, please remove them"" but no product is shown, and I have to manually remove one product at a time to check if it is the one causing the issue. I have the same problem on the website. Please check and fix this issue"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I'm very happy with my many purchases from this site. It has been very dependable. And I would definitely recommend. And when I had an issue with a product getting it resolved was not a problem and they2 fixed it immediately. Which I was very pleased with. And all this has been done with just only through this app. Good site and good app. Thank you. Also it's very nice that you keep track of each order you make. It lets you know where it is during all the destinations even through usps
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love this app... it has pretty decent clothes for how cheap they are. Along with the house decorations. Everytime I order I'm always satisfied with the product. Very affordable prices as well. I bought a hole new wardrobe from this app, with applying coupons to the order and the price went even lower. They are always giving away free coupons as well. Highly recommend ordering Off of here."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best shopping app EVERR!! I'm obsessed with this app it's just about the only place I do my shopping now! There's a HUGE variety with extremely low prices, the only thing is it takes a little bit to ship, but considering your paying such a good price it's worth the wait, you can earn points and use them towards your purchase, always giving coupons and so much more , I'm also a plus size and I love how everything I've ordered fits me great!! They even have household, jewelry, electronics and more"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Shein is an awesome app for buying super cute clothing that's affordable. The app is easy to use. I love the points you receive for checking in daily and for leaving reviews of the items you purchase. Clothing is good quality and true to size. It's shipped from China but usually only takes less than 2 weeks to arrive. I 100% recommend this app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Some things are cheap but for the prices I don't mind the long shipping or the occasional cheap fabric. Most things if you're conscious of the fabric your buying (some tends to wrinkle easier than others) you can go around the clothes not worth it to find stunners. Shoes are uncomfortable but you get what you pay for!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I'm sad there's no coupon applicable to all now and the highest points I could get for discount is 100 points. Hoping shein 2020 will be back
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love it, 95% of what I ordered was an amazing fit. Due to excellent descriptions, I knew exactly what to expect. The items that weren't a good fut,(shoes) were super easy to return. I was super happy with the quality of the items, quick shipping to Hawaii, and ease of returns. Overall A+ company."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It can be discouraging, disappointing and a lil bit depressing....especially when it comes to ordering clothes on line....sizes are always a let down. However, Shein has seemed to attract my daughters attention with its unique and gorgeous style. As well as fitting comfortable to their liking and feeling good about what they wear. SHEIN MAKES US HAPPY!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The last 2 times i have ordered something, there was a problem with shipping, and it ended with returning the items. Usually, when i order something, it should be notified if there's any problem with the address !! I have been waiting for more than 3 weeks, and at the end, they sent me an email that all items could not be delivered.. i am not gonna do shopping from this app anymore.."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The quality of clothings, consistency of sizes, and prices are so far the best I have experienced among other Chinese websites. 9 out of 10 items that I purchased are perfect. And you get points from writing reviews for the items you purchase. However, the only thing is that they screen through your reviews and they do not approve anything that's negative."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The most user friendly shopping app I have tried. Shein have good quality clothing and the app makes it very easy to filter search results to find the styles that you like e.g. materials, colour, length, sleeve and other details. I have always had a good experience shopping with them and cannot recommend them enough"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great prices but the majority of the clothes are NOT made of cotton, are often very thin and see through, sizes are askew - most of the time run small. If they aren't too small they are boxy (no shape) or have extra large arm holes. The shoes are super cheap, made of an extremely light material that look and feel super cheap. I have a small handful of clothes and zero shoes I have kept and not returned. Thenrutn policy is great!!Be sure to read reviews!! They are super helpful"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very good app and I love it. The items are pretty good quality and are cheap and affordable. My only problem is that when I ordered it took nearly a month to arrive even though it was only a few items. Other thanthat I have had no problems and would recommend to everyone who wants good,cheap lothes and items"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm over 50 but love fashion and Shein offers that, quality isn't too bad at all I must have ordered about 60 + items and never had to return anything. Key is to upload your measurements and always, always read the reviews, especially the sizing and also material type filter on photos and then you pretty much can't go wrong. Household stuff is so good too.. love this site!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,So happy had to return 4 items no trouble at all brought another 4 item fitted perfectly would have no hesitation in recommending to others. Rapped
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"No complaints, returns are easy& free. Customer service is fine. Check clothes sizes/material/reviews on each item .. some stuff comes super quick if it's held in the UK depot, stuff from China takes ~2 weeks but worth waiting for. Ppl are always suprised if I reveal how little i paid. Also with the 30% off vouchers, points & sales my basket is always heavily discounted."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm genuinely pleased with everything I've ordered. I was hesitant at first, considering cheap sites get a bad rep for poor quality and incorrect sizing but I was pleasantly wrong. The products have the sizings pop up when you click on them, that's amazing. Highly recommend, there's a plethora of products to explore."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I recently bought a few items of clothing from SHEIN, and im waiting for them in the mail currently. Im hoping all goes well. Im hoping they fit, and come nice, and clean. But the actual app is good, easy to use, they have a good selection, and very very cute items. I might shop with SHEIN again if shipping goes well, and my items fit."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this app ,they have so many endless shopping sections and are so offerdable and shipping is really fast!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! Since discovering this around 2019, I haven't bought clothes from another place. The clothes are cute and with the community helping each other out with reviews, you can see and compare the garment, prior to purchasing. Undergarments are high quality, accessories, earphones? They have it all. The rewards system, is honestly *chef's kiss* . I've saved so much money and now I'm on S3 💗🌸✨ happy with this! More power!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great things to buy and the best part is that it is cheap!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So far so good! I'm new to the app, have ordered once through the website and was impressed at the speed of delivery and quality of the clothing. Not traditional tiny Chinese clothing, definitely worth it for the big lasses like myself. Edited - I live in New Zealand, to return clothes they have to be sent to Australia at my expense, my return postage was almost the same as the cost of the item. Be VERY careful in your sizing and your choices"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Not very good, app sends useless notifications CONSTANTLY!! Spent two hrs browsing and saving items to my cart only for the ENTIRE CART to be removed as it synced with my phones cart, 2hrs after I first opened the website.. They were both logged into my account, I checked multiple times.. If it synced your phones cart with the PC's cart AS SOON AS YOU LOGGED IN THEN THIS WOULDNT EVER BE AN ISSUE, or simply added the other items to the existing ones instead of GETTING RID OF THEM! Useless app!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Exceeded my expectations! I've now ordered twice from Shein and have been pleasantly surprised with the quality and service! To say the orders come from China and I live in the UK, they have arrived in around 2 weeks for me, which is great! The clothes themselves were pretty true to size, and the quality of the fabric has been lovely, especially given the price I paid. They also give you offers at the checkout all the time plus free shipping and Klarna! 100% recommend :)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"For those who aren't familiar with Shein, it offers a variety of merchandise at EXTREMELY reasonable prices. Catagories include: clothing (women, men, kids, even pets), shoes, accessories, stationary, electronics & home. App is easy to use, doesn't lag & has everything the ws does. I use it for everything: browsing purchases, writing reviews. Very user friendly. Finally, you can earn points easily (daily check in, reviewing purchases). They equal $$. Shein also gives coupons. TRY IT!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The customer service is terrible, the time of shipping is a hit or miss, sometimes it comes fast sometimes it doesn't, the sizing when it comes to shoes are off. The clothes are not bad, they have some decent things and have sometimes horrible fabric. It's the low price so I guess you get what you pay for. Please Improve on customer service"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Its hard to find clothes with their names sometimes, i have to go to the category if wanna find something and it takes long, also it hard to search clothes in the favorite section, I thought I could just go there and search for instance: ""jackets"" and all the jacket i liked would appear but I have to go to the category all the time, I think favorite items should have their own folder. All in all i love it! I dont know how giftcards work but i tried to get one and idk what happened from there..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love that I can make boards on my wishlist. This has helped a great deal in putting into perspective the colour palette/style I am trying to achieve. Everything is organized just the way I like it. And I can batch what to buy next. It would be awesome if we could move items around within a board. In the order we want them.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Overall very good! *Read the reviews on the items and listen to what others suggest for sizing *clothes aren't going to be high quality they are at very low cost but I honestly love it as someone who doesn't know how to dress im able to buy items im unsure of and im not out a ton of money The app works great and I've had zero issues so far
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Easy to use and a wide variety of choices to choose from who are fashionably unique which u will not worry if u wear those and you might meet someone wearing same style and color. Although , sixe charts are helpful but sometimes are misleading. But most of my orders fit me well or if not easy to sew to adjust."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Quality, diversity, fast shipment. There are little trend styling contests,, a points login system, and opportunities to earn points. Clothes are good quality. I wouldn't want to order a swim suit, but that goes for any swimsuit. Measurements are listed after your size. There's also curve plus for women like me, and maternity!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It seems like fraud as I ordered but doesn't show up any tracking details. Not satisfied with the app. Want my money back.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is easy to navigate & understand. I have yet to have any issues with the app. The clothes are good quality for the price, but if you're picky about fabrics, then read the item description. Also make sure you follow the measurements on their size charts, and read the customer feed back. It goes a long way. Especially if you are plus size. 🖤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app. Selection of goods is fantastic. Sometimes I wish it is easier to navigate to specific brands. Quality of items also quite good. Need to read reviews and descriptions. Fast delivery. You will probably have to pay customs when importing, so be aware of that extra cost."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Awesome experience. The layout of the app is very easy to use and to understand, with no distracting ads. Prices are fair, shipping was quick and not very expensive, and I was very delighted to have received a few vouchers for creating an account. After receiving my purchase I was also very happy to find that the quality of the items was very good for the price I paid, and the sizing was true to the advertising."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very bad app....think alot before you download it...coz it will make U addicted 🤤🤤 I've never been into online shopping or even shopping but since I downloaded it..I shopped in the same day and today I purchased twice..LOL that's not me..😓 Very wide range of versatile clothing backed up with superp app without any lowsy browsing or bad quality images.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A huge range of different clothing and styles to choose from. I love the fact that they promote people to post pictures of themselves in the clothes in the reviews. This takes away any anxiety of how will the clothes look in person, will they suit my figure etc. You can get a pretty good idea from other people's pictures. Would be great in the recommended sections of they didn't show you clothes that weren't in your size. Also, I don't like the customer service bot. They're just unhelpful"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I used to enjoy shopping because i always had a coupon of 20 pc for purchases above 300 shekels now i don't get it anymore. I also used to get express shipping with courier which i don't get anymore. I have tried contacting but u need verification n i don't get an email with a verification no. There should be a direct contact line on customer service. I also joined the VIP service but there is no benefit so i would like to cancel it.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Shein uses SpeedX to deliver your packages in which you never receive. Please look up the over 672 complaints. My package was never received and the proof of delivery is a fake picture of a house that not even the same color of your house. Also there no way to contact either company. Need to contact lawyer and news station. They need to be stop from scamming people.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"App is good. Clothes are cheap but decent, you get what you pay for. But shipping is SO ridiculous. When you purchase a total amount eligible for free shipping then apply a coupon, the coupon is subtracted from the total which makes it NOT eligible for free shipping anymore! That's absurd! Coupons shouldn't affect the total of the items!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Everything about Shien is PERFECT! I refuse to shop clothes from anywhere else. High quality clothes, super cheap, fast delivery, never disappointed with my purchase. Plus the app creates so many ways to save money, between simple daily log ins and fun/creative fashion competitions you can earn points that convert to monies! and that can be applied to your purchases! Also they have flash sales, and that's my favourite part! It's worth it. I show everyone this app. 2yrs committed to Shien ❤️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a really good app also you get points when you check in every day it restarts a week after you start and a good and affordable place to buy stuff it's just the quality of some items are trash and some of them are good just look at there iews and the more reviews it has the bigger chance that what they are saying is right and you get points from that too. and like some days there is great deals like no shipping cost on Sundays I think.and like on the 15 this of every monththey do something.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"App rating only. The app is great. As for the return policy, it's not the best. The return policy prevents me from buying more items, because I don't want to get charged for something that does not fit or look good. And I've purchased swimming suits that don't fit right, and I couldn't return them. If I did, it would cost me more money to ship them back. So I get stuck with the clothes, and no refund. So I'm very cautious with my purchase."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It was my first ordering from these people, The price is a good deal I spent over $300, However their packing is just disgusting. All of the bags I ordered were all bend up, the invoice was ripped multiple times. I contacted support, and in the middle of the conversation she ended it. After I took pictures off of the bags that were bend up. This what happened when you trying to get a bargain. Y'all must do better packing and sending out packages, not in bags put them in boxes. Never again."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app. I absoltely love Shein.I order regulary. I have started doing my own acrylic &gel nails. Shein is my nmber 1 app for nail art. They've a huge range of nail supplies. From full cover nails and tips, a huge range of stickers and waterdecals. the most beautiful nail charms and rhinestones in every style you can imagine to nail equipment such as nail lamps, buffers, files etc. Promo codes and points you can earn from activities & leaving reviews makes things even more inexpensive."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ordered some items back in the beginning of September. Havent received items, ervi have said they've return them although they made no attempts to deliver them but you can't not make direct contact with shein themselves or when reporting the issue there's no direct option for my problem. On both side its awful service as still I'm not wiser to what's going on or when I'm going to get my refund. I wouldn't recommend ordering from here if you are banking and actually receiving the items."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Everything is right and prices aren't high!! Great place to shop and shipping comes pretty fast! I've been shopping here for for two to three years now and I could just sit and browse through everything because EVERYDAY there are new clothing coming onto the app!! Love this app and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for clothes that are fashionable and affordable!!!👍🏽💕
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"shein is a really easy way to buy clothes that aren't to expensive. I've been buying for a few years and I'm always happy with my experience, the clothes are cute and so comfortable. Shipping my take a while but the wait is worth it I would honestly recommend trying it out and buying some clothes they have coupons and great deals!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I Love Shein. I must admit I tend to prefer ordering from my laptop on their website as it's just easier when I have extensive wishlists etc. But the app does pretty well in providing a customer focused experience, complete with filters to narrow searches down. Some words are hard to search on if they're items that are known by different names in other countries. (i.e. enamel pins needs to be searched using ""brooch"" which is an old fashioned word)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've ordered many things and am beyond pleased with the pricing, shipping cost, and time, lroduct quality and sizing! I've ordered for me, my husband, and all 4 of my kids. I've returned one damaged item for free and was refunded immediately. Great customer service and all around impressive company. Thanks again for all the great clothes."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The apps efficency is effortless. Shein is a great online platform where you can get nice fashionable clothing. I have bought a couple items from them and their dress, swimwear and jumpsuit material is quite amazing. Their watches ⌚ are comfortable and stylish. Earrings are beautiful and make you feel sexy. I can vouch for the website and the online shopping store."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is very easy to navigate. What I like about Shein is when I see an item that I like I can drill down on that page to get similar options. The items are very well priced, and of good quality. All off The items I have ordered so far fits very good. Tracking items are easy to follow and any issues were handled efficiently by the Shein reps. Keep up the good work Shein."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Fantastic! Don't let the low prices fool you. You always receive the exact item pictured, unlike from companies like Wish. If you pay attention to the given measurements on the clothing items (which are immediately locatable) you will never have to return anything. &, even if you did have to return something, it's super easy! Extraordinarily low prices on high value items! I see how people get addicted to Shein! Also, the shipping time is great! I've always received my orders within 10 days. A++"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Love Shein. You just have to be very careful about the sizes and know your measurements not go by s-m-l ect. Or you are likely to get something that doesn't fit. But the good part about them is they always have free returns. So anything you don't like or doesn't fit you can just send it back. And they always have coupons. If I don't find I have a good coupon left I just search online and they take valid online coupons as well. Deeply discounted items then coupons makes huge savings!! So easy. ❤

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Worst customer service possible. I got hacked lost more than $700. I can't contact a real agent and live chat doesn't really exist. I was told I should get an email in 24 hrs and it's been 3 days! There's no number to call and the hacker can still access my account and I can't do anything! They changed my phone number but I can't change it back? Seriously?
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I find that plus size clothing is lacking in variety. Materials used are not the best quality. Plaids and stripes are never matched, therefore, it makes the garment looked unpolished and cheap. Blazers and coats should always as a rule be lined, yet are not. Pocket placement on pants need to be readjusted so as to not give the look of ""mom jeans"". Purses are always too small. I'm willing to pay a bit extra for these improvements."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Shipping is quick and everything arrives in perfect order. The only negative for me is that sizing isn't consistent. I've bought many items that fit perfectly but some have been too small and one I received recently was way too big despite me ordering the size that the size chart indicates is correct.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Excellent! Love love love Shein. However wish the vouchers would show up easier on the app. When using desktop computer current vouchers show up and can get applied easily. When ordering through app they don't which is frustrating so generally I have to browse on the app add my stuff to basket and then complete on a computer to apply my vouchers. Other than that i do love it!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I can honestly say that for me this SHEIN app is perfect. Great user interface, easy to use, wide range of products available with fast and safe delivery, good reusable packaging (zip bags for easy and safe storage) Orders often come earlier with easy tracking information and Email updates. Highly recommended for anyone interested. Ps The clothes are beautiful and high quality for the prices 😍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great easy, fast shipping, and awesome clothing that doesn't break your wallet. Clothing that you can be confident to wear no matter the occasion! My only issue is it's so tough to choose because of how great the choices are Phenomenal. Shein also fixed a error promptly I had moved from a address over 3 years ago and I contacted customer service online and they promptly fixed the address for everything before it had shipped out , thank you."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have loved almost everything I have bought. I love being able to read the reviews to see how an item fit someone that's around my size. The only issue I have had is sometimes the earrings are either bent or the prong has broken off when I have tried to wear them, but this only has happened with the hoop earrings. They are only a dollar so I feel you get what you paid for. I love all the clothes though, and the prices are amazing! I can buy almost 50 items for under 100 dollars on clearance."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Well would have gave a 5 star, but as I went to place my second order imagine that no free shipping. I really like this but $3.99 on shipping when it was suppose to have been free shipping. They do offer good prices on their items. But when you can only buy an item or two at a time, shipping really cuts in."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I ordered for the first time a few weeks back and recieved my order quicker than the expected delivery date provided. The payment process was quick and no app issues with cart items or anything. The app is super easy to use and navigate. Great experience.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best shopping app ever! I love everything that I've gotten and it's all been at such low prices. With Shein I don't have to worry about ordering the wrong size bc returns are free and you get your money refunded to you. Another great thing is that with every package you receive you get a 15% off coupon. Shein has all kinds of styles of clothing and even has its own section for us curvey girls. It's a win win, for sure!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,SheIn is just super good. Their products are amazing 🤩🤩
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Loads of options to choose from.. May it be clothes, make up, kitchenware, baking things, etc...some of the things I bought are not a good quality/damaged but thw good thing u will be refunded as soon as they received back the returned items and you emailed the picture of damaged products... All prices are reasonable and it's delivered earlier than expected... Im enjoying shopping with shein for the last couple of years now... Highly recommended for everyone who love shopping online.."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have become a fan of Shein in the last month... The clothes are amazing, the service is fast and the delivery bags are so cute... Each item is individually wrapped in zip lock bags. You can track your items from your account... But so far every order has taken 9 days from date of payment and also they do clearpay and klarna payments too."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Somethings could definitely be a little cheaper for the quality, 6 items shouldn't be 100 dollars sometimes... but other than this I think the app is great, I get a lot of deals and find a lot of bulk clothing items for my modeling AND wardrobe. I'd like to start seeing dollar panties and more affordable intimate sets that are under the 12 dollar range but with better quality as many fabrics rip within a couple wears or washes. Other than that I still have stuff from 2019."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love this! It's easy to navigate & understand especially for people like myself who are tech challenged lol. They make it so easy to put your favorite items in your wishlist & simple to place an order. I love how you can just track your items right on Shein without having to copy the tracking # & go on the carriers website. I just love this app! 😊
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Used it for the first time but I am not at all satisfied with the services and the product they offered. Firstly, the item was faulty and damaged and the another one was too much costly as per the quality I got. I requested them to return the items for which they asked me to pay. I mean seriously, Delivering a degraded product and then asking for return prices. Anyway, I will not be able to make up my mind for future purchases after this first experience."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My favorite trusted site to shop on. Shipping is roughly 2-3 weeks and comes well packaged. Fantastic prices, always has awesome sales and extra ways to save. What you see is exactly what you get. I have ordered a LOT and never not received an item. I also got picked for a free trial which was awesome."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Just ok This app is just ok. It is user friendly, even offers you other suggestions if the product you're looking for isn't available. However the clothing is pretty cheap. Even my 16yr old who uses the app has agreed. Cheap clothing and not worth the price. Sizes are way to small. Extra large isn't extra large but rather a medium to large."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Entertaining, fun and interesting. 😁"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The shopping is ok, it takes long to arrive but it's not a big turn off, I can deal with that. What bothers me the dates on vouchers and/or other places, it takes me a while to figure out if it's the month first or day first as sometimes is in one way (like tracking other) and other times is in another (like in vouchers). i wish they stick on one way to date things or another option is to write the month with letters like Nov-12-21 or 12-Nov-21 so I will know exactly when my vouchers expire...."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Just Downloaded The App...So Far So Good... Splendid Prices...But Shipping Should ALWAYS Be FREE...Or At Least Far Less Than $3.99!..4 STARS For Now...Till Better Shipping Charges...
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love Shein! I've been shopping through the app for over 3 years & they're quality did step-up a little bit since they became more popular. The only thing I would say is, definitely look at the reviews before purchasing so you can have an idea of what it would look like on yourself. They stay having great coupons & discounts. Also you get points for reviewing the clothes you purchase. If you need to return something, they make it very easy. Just print the label & slap it on the box."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing. The clothes are awesome and amazing quality for such a low prices!! They frequently have sales and you can get shein points for an extra discount. I would definitely recommend for anyone who likes to save money but look fresh and stylish, you can even show and express your style due to Shein having a social media element as well. If you buy anything from Shein, you will not be disappointed. 👍👍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"1. Most of the fashion items are not original designs. Not too cheap either. 2. The sizes runs small, you always need to size up. (most of the fashion items has sewing defects) 3. The VIPS rewards are totally Rubbish as they wasn't providing good VIPS perks. (it will be great if it provide free products once a month for the VIPS) 4. The free shipping fee is only for over 19 euros which will make you shop less as you have to shop more items which will be expensive to reach more than 19 euros."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really like Shein , I've never got any clothes , but will reconsider. You get free coupons , and if you get make or get any likes on your review , you get points to use during checkout . Not only that they have petite , medium , and plus sizes , if you don't ever see your size you could leave your size in a feedback. Very fun and would definitely catch your attention. (I'm still shopping for stuff , even though I don't have any money 😭😭)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Me and my mom ordered things on February 4th and now is March 3 and I still have not received it but at least it gave me simple idea's for crocheting
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have not had any issue with this store. The quality is pretty consistent. Note that if something is super cheap what you get in the mail might also be cheap in quality unless there's a sale going on. But on average the quality is good and the clothes are nice. Ive been surprised quite a few times when buying their more expensive coats,and what arrives is top notch. Something id wear to an event. Just try it and see if you like it. Sizing can very immensely depending the item but read the reviews and go from there. All I do is shop online so I know my size and measurements so its not a problem for me"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Never had any problem, the app is very good. Easy to understand and have a beautiful user interface. I really appreciate it the Shein App."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Really love this app its super easy to use, everything turns up and is exactly as advertised. I live in NZ, plus sized clothing is uncommon, unflattering, undersized, shrinks, and is $70 an item. Shein has a absolutely fantastic range of clothing in my size they are shapely, flattering and very affordable with so many styles. I can now dress outside the way I feel inside instead of having to wear mens clothes cause its all I could afford. Definitely reccomend this app and retailer."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Giving 2 stars because the sight is generally cheap with pretty good quality items. I got a bathing suit, top and bottom, for like 13 bucks and it was really good quality, like 30 bucks quality. But I live in the California countryside on a property with 3 other houses so my adress was an ""incomplete adress"". I recieved 2 of of my 3 packages and they wouldn't send the 3rd because of my adress which I don't understand."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love SHEIN. Prices are affordable, and if you go based on ratings on clothing, you can find some great options. It may be a bit of a gamble based on how things look on the models, but I find every online shop is like this. I wait for free shipping and it's always served me well! I'll continue using this for myself and for cute kids clothing as well."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The variety is endless. I love shoes and I literraly can search for hours. Area for improvement is the return policy. I wanted to return an item and Buffalo keeps on asking for a token nr. This is a huge frustration. Also when I ask for assistance from shein I just receive response via generic email about the return policy. Maybe implement Live chat . Otherwise the products is great.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Update:Purchase is still nowhere close to being shipped. I literally feel like I have been robbed of the hundreds of dollars I spent. No customer service! No way to talk to someone about the fact they took my money! They misspelled delivery under the FAQ delivery tab. Now I really don't believe their company is a legitimate business. Unprofessional thieves! Seem to have great deals but forget about ever getting what you ordered! I'd rather pay more and actually get the items from somewhere else!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really fun app they just fail to mention you also get a notification a few weeks after you order that states you have to pay income taxes as well for it to actually be allowed to come into your country. I also wish that would make more of their clothes (especially sweatshirts, shirts and sweatpants) in cotton and less polyester. All and all I love it though, best app to pass time."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very saavy,innovative fashion for everyone. I think this may be the largest detailed and thought out fashion for Plus size women. You have changed the game as far as providing unique, non-trendy clothing for us, this is why I love you SheIn, you have such a wide variety of everything fashionable with the exception of larger sizes in shoe wear. You have cute items for the Home as well, ""one stop shopping"", WHAT! Lastly you have fashion to fit everyone's taste level. Did I gush or what!?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've ordered multiple times from here and every time was satisfying. I've never had any problems until now, I've recently been trying to order stuff from Shein but it just won't process my payment. I tried to see if it worked on other platforms and it did, so it's definitely not on my end. I'm hoping it gets fixed because I'm really looking forward to the stuff I wanted to order..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Awesome. Shipping is fast the clothes are actually amazing quality believe it or not. I pretty much got a full wardrobe after weightloss. Tip: read reviews and accurately measure yourself. Check sizes everytime. They can change between clothing types but have the measurements in relation to the specific clothing under each size. You can never go wrong. App it self is easy to use with some cool features for what I expected from a clothing app. Live feed and point systems/code giveaways.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great site to stay fashionable on a budget. You get what you pay for so if it's low price, that is probably the amount of wear you get out of it. If it's higher priced in my opinion it lasts alot longer and is higher quality material. Sizes listed so take measurements. It's very easy to know which size to get after you have bought several items. You simply go by those sizes when shopping. Most all of my clothing now comes from Shein!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Very bad service most specially their logistics partners
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Im' a dancer, 5'6, 105 lbs. The small in anything, especially Emery Rose fits perfectly. I made one error with a pair of jeans. They were an amazing fit! I washed them, can't button them! I do not know if I can return them since I washed them!!! I have a new wardrobe now and except for 1 pair of Jeans, I am thrilled with every thing I have ordered!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Some of the material is very thin, but styled right it looks great and you can't beat the price or all the discounts. My favorite part is how you can find people who have purchased an item, see their sizes and compare your to theirs to determine what size will look good on you. Takes the guessing out of it!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"There are a great variety of items. It's just sad that most of the pretty tops (the ones I like) are cropped so not appropriate for work. I also don't appreciate having to pay expensive customs on top of delivery/ original cost. But overall I can't complain, delivery is quite quick for worldwide shipping."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Most clothes are decent quality. I have only ever bought items if they have several reviews with pictures. I have t been able to find a swimsuit that works, even using the proper measurements. The only reason I didn't give a 5 star review is because it takes forever to earn points, they aren't worth very much, and they expire after a certain amount of time."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the the outfits I feel like they are custom made for me...best quality delivered on time and pocket friendly...I feel like a runaway model with the outfits 🥰 I would like to ask...if possible can there be different designs for the same outfit....for instance if it's bodycon dress it can be off~ shoulder, long~sleeved, short~sleeved or neckline sometimes I really love the colour of the outfit but I don't like the style ...if possible that would be great..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I ordered over $350 clothes and my torso is longer, so needed medium. u only get 1 return where they'll pay for shipping. its been almost 2 mos and I've gotten $140shein$ &4 items back..and one item would fit a banchee. Sizes are messed up and you have to communicate though email--until they block you--because NOW this package can't be delivered to the SAME address used previously and can't find the package is because they use SWYFT? Oh, and there's no number to contact anyone. NEVER in my life"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I would rate Shein 10 stars if i could. I was told about the app from a family member, and one day decided to give it a shot. I am very skeptical and picky when it comes to buying clothes online, and let me say, this is by far my favorite online clothing store. I downloaded it maybe 2 months ago and have already lost count of how many items i've purchased already. They have a great variety of affordable and beautiful clothes, shoes, accessories, etc. Shein never fails to impress me!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My absolute favourite shop ever!!! They sell lush clothes with my style. If your struggling with finding clothes in your style I definitely recommend using this app!! The delivery does take a while (4 weeks sometimes) to arrive but that doesn't bother me at all. They also have pet items, home store, phone cases and way more, definitely recommend, you won't regret it!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The app shows cute clothes but has inconsistent sizing & offers no way to search for measurements to mitigate their inconsistency. They have a plus size section but don't actually make clothes for plus size bodies. Only 1 thing fit me & I actually measured myself several times to be sure. I couldn't even zip my knee high boots up. This company isn't truly interested in including plus size bodies or making our shopping experience easier.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's good just for clothes/shoes, but then I bought some home items that came damaged or were poor quality that immediately broke. I was upset as I didn't pay for them to be damaged/broken, so went to customer service (super sketchy as they have no hotline in Aus). The people responding on the ticketing system just replied without reading my messages and gave me the run-about, and one was really rude. I still had to pay for the damaged stuff. This whole experience really put me off using SHEIN."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have placed my order and i have been emailing since so long. My amount is paid and the order is stuck at one place from so many days. Such unprofessionalism! Such delay! Very disappointed for the first time with online shopping. I have never faced any problem with online shopping. I ordered from Shein first time and faced the worst experience!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's very difficult using Shein on my laptop. Additionally, I would love if the Taiwan site can add an option to change the language (although billing and clothing descriptions and search are in English. Edit: I removed one star from my rating because SheIn has made several changes which I do not like. You can only use one coupn at a time and now your Points have an expiry date, I don't like that because I usually save up to make my purchases. I don't like the new policy."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,My experience with SHEIN has been outstanding! The clothing is just as it was pictured online. I totally love SHEIN. I will shop here forever and ever. I have to stop looking sometimes because I find myself wanting more and more items every single time. Shein is simply the best and I can't see myself shopping anywhere else ever again.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is very easy to use. Free from ads, it makes shopping easy & enjoyable. Organized categories of items. Creating boards to save favorites for future shopping is a big plus. Prices are decent. Quality of items depends!! kitchen items are of high quality. Shoes are not, The dresses were amazing as well as jewelry. I recommend reading reviews of real people who bought the item. Delivery is fast. Customer service is good. The only minus is packaging (BAD) Please Shein consider it. THANKS"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been obsessed with this app since I found it. Being a bigger girl, its impossible to find affordable and good looking clothes but I can find anything for any mood I'm in on here. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is it doesn't let me review the items one at a time so I can't give a fully accurate review until I have actually worn everything and have to review the entire order at once. Not bad for small orders but not good for a big one."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,My experiences have been great! I follow the size charts and everything always fits and I love rocking Shein styles. I do wish there was a 2days option ( at expense ) for shipping. Even with the express shipping I wasn't able to get my things in time and I ordered over a week in advance. I would have paid up to $25 to have it sooner.

When I tracked it, it's last activity was in late October saying it never even got to dispatching and I couldn't find anywhere to refund my order or get it reshipped.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"If you've had a bad experience with them it's probably your own fault 🤷🏻‍♀️ I've ordered a large variety of things and have only had one bad experience and that was the mail persons fault and they STILL resent my items. Always read reviews, double check measurements for EACH ITEM as they do vary and look at photos that other people have shared to see what the item will actually look like. I've even impulse ordered something brand new with no reviews on a whim and was honestly blown away!"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app inundates you with notifications every few minutes. Its excessive and I wish you could lessen the frequency but the only option is to turn them off completely. Also when it comes to the online ads on social media platforms, when i click on it, it would be helpful if they redirected me to the SHEIN app and not the regular website. Because then I have to either log into the regular website or go into the app and try to find the outfit, which usually doesn't work out."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's good but some things don't come like how they show in the picture it's only happened 3 times tho
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really love this app, has been my topmost app for shopping since I've known it. With vouchers and coins, I find it to be very, very affordable. Only thing is, may be there could have been some exchange program instead of returning the item if may be a bigger or a smaller size of the same item is required."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I think you have a bug. I'm ready to check out and pay for what's in my cart. Everything goes well until I need to put TAC number for the payment. When the TAC number comes in, it's inevitable that I need to click on it to see in order to process payment. I could not key in the numbers and it just goes back to the app page where I need to select payment. Do you want my money or not? It's frustrating"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The best shopping experience Ive had. Beautiful products, looks exactly like the pictures on the app. And they do deliver, even if its sometimes delayed, for reasons beyond its control. The app is very easy to use.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"One of the worst site for online shopping,They don't deliver product on time.Worst Return Policy,They by themselves divide the order into multiple package and when you place a return request you are charged for pickup(so basically if you have to return 2 items which they had delivered you in different package although you ordered it together and placed the return together, they will charge you 65 INR on the individual package).Material of the product is very bad. They don't let us write on site"

I haven't had a problem with this app, ever so you don't see me complaining. Also, the things that you see here are elegant, cute, and affordable. Unlike other online shopping apps that have ridiculous prices for their items.."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Like the app. My issue is that I still haven't received my order. Instead I got an email saying they're giving me 300 points because my package is late. Couldn't specify why. I'm just going to return the items. $3 isn't worth bad customer service because I really was expecting to get my items by now and was hopeful about buying from them again but not anymore.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Ii have experienced this app is so usefull and it very easy to use. Everything is well described and you can trust this app if you send in the right information. Well done! The only problem I have is with a shipping company, it sometimes takes way too long to get here ( about more then a month ). I once ordered something and the shipping took way to long and then i ordered something after that. The second shipping was fast and got here in time, but i was still waiting for my first order."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the app and the shopping experience. The buyers review are so helpful as well. The uneasy part for me is the shipment tracking in the app itself, the update after sellers shipped, was a bit vague as it doesn't say where the parcel is, just mentioned that it is otw, and it took around 2 - 4 days before the estimated date for arrival to be updated that the parcel had landed in the country after maybe 2 weeks of no update. Made me worried for a while."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Good app and cheap and good products but my mum ordered some items and she never received them and shein said they have been delivered and in result of this she never got her items and never got her money back.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Most of what u get from shein app is the same as in pictures but, sometimes the quality of the stuff is not the best. even though if the price wasn't cheap u might still get a cheap quality and that's (sometimes) otherwise the app is amazing and i love how the return items is easy."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love Shein, great products at a great price. Last few years the quality has gone up. Shipping is quick. Returns are easy. I'm not name brand loyal so shein is perfect for me and my family. I always get lots of compliments on my outfits. Reading the reviews is key since sizing can be a bit wonky sometimes. Overall my favorite place to shop."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So far the cloths get delivered on time, come packaged beautifully. The cloths are pretty well made.. sometimes the material could be a little better quality but usually always good the material, and the stitching is always on point. And the PRICES cant go wrong. Havent had a problem yet so for now they get 5 stars from me!!! Thanks shein"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is great, you can even upload pictures of stuff you want to find and it searches the app for you. My stuff always comes before the delivery estimate, and when I had problems with missing or defective items they answered and refunded me right away. I'm all for sustainability, but we cant all afford vintage clothes. Shein is a great alternative"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very easy to order from, a great variety of clothes etc to choose from .. sizes not always the same as UK some smaller and some huge ..think its meant for tall ladies as I always need to take some off the bottom of trousers etc .. boot sizes are strange, I ordered a size 4 and was sent a 36 which is a 3 but said 4 on the box 🤔 but overall good value and gr8 returns if needed"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is the absolute best shopping app I've ever encountered, not sponsored. There's so many features to the app. Shopping, of course, a free trial section, social media based on looks or singular fashion pieces provided by Shein, a point earning system, coupons, etc. & it's not just fashion! There's so many more things like housewares & knickknacks. I'm very impressed and satisfied with the selection and the clothes, shoes & jewelry I've bought have all been of good quality. Shop Shein! ✊👏❤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Pile of trash, if you sift through enough you will find some alright items. Returns are a headache and they could give two flying ducks for the planet with the amount of plastic they use, the fabrics are most likely soaked in carcoginic chemicals. The items rarely reflect the images. This is fast fashion as we are all aware and you get what you pay for. The ""fine"" jewellery section is alright... which is itself costume jewellery under the guise of 14k etc. 😇"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Honestly at first I was hesitant. Then I got some clothes and I didn't like some of them. But for the most part most of the clothes come in really nice. You just have to pay attention to the pictures that they show on the app and use the size guide because each side's guide is different for each piece of clothing going back in the second time to make a big order and I loved almost everything I ordered from there. It's a great app for clothes when people don't have money.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"App works really well! You can find great deals on here if you're prepared for a slight wait in shipping and a bit of a lower quality item. What I like is that the quality isn't always as low as you'd think, paying 8-20 USD for clothing items. I've gotten some truly awesome things on here, and if I no longer need them, I don't feel so bad about canning them or cutting them up for scraps because I didn't spend so much on them. I love Shein! Just wish I knew how to pronounce it... Lol"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Buggy app to contact customer support. If i am chatting with a live customer support agent, abd due to some reason i surf another screen in the app may to be check something, there is no way for me to resume that chat. It just doesnt show up anywhere. Also i cannot ask for another live chat until the previous conversation is marked as closed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The user experience is good. The app is easy to navigate and make purchases. The people are also great, they leave great reviews which makes buying something easier. However, Shein likes to take points away once you get over 1000 points making it hard to get great discounts."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Their products are usually good quality even for the cheaper prices, shipping is fast and often free, there's a cashback program and there's lots of promos to look forward to. App is user-friendly and has a clean look, easy to navigate. But Shein is notorious for stealing various artists' work for commercial gain, among other unethical practices, which is not cool at all. Very disappointing and on the lookout for alternatives."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I have only ordered once. The quality of clothes I've gotten are great! A very reasonable shipping rates as well! That's always a bonus 😁 when the shipping is too high that makes me not want to shop at other places shein doesn't do too bad in this department. Shipping as well is very quick.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shein has some of the best clothes that I have seen from an online retailer! It is good quality for a great price. I think they can do much better with packaging 📦, specifically with jewelry. When I order jewelry it always arrives damaged and I am not happy about that. So for that they get 4 stars. I am happy with the clothes I buy and the sales are amazing! 😊"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The sizing sitewide is very off and on. One Xl could fit like a L or a 3x fits like a medium 😑. Makes the buying experience a guessing game and difficult. Alot if clothes aren't good guality material (keep in mind you get what you pay for but, at the same time they could do better than using scrubs material to make a blouse)..... READ REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING ALWAYS! 👍🏾"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I think SHEIN is a very good store to use if you always have a budget! They make very high quality things and they sell shoes jewlery clothes etc. Although you have to pay for delivery, it comes very quickly and is never dirty or damaged! However, sometimes I do have to wash and iron it because of the cripples and smell. There are little to no ADS as well! Always flash sales and coupons available for free! Altogether it is a very nice store to shop in would 💯 recommend!👌"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Wonderful clothing and affordable. Takes a while to come to your address, & need to order one size bigger for womens' shirts and dresses. However, I've heard it is better to order one size smaller on pants and shorts. I haven't ordered those items yet. The material is rather thin, but cute! Overall, I was pleased and I'm still ordering clothing through them! Hope this helped!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love buying stuffs here! However, it's disappointing after all purchases, free trial application always being denied. Quick review for co-sellers they must provide exact sizes, there are some ex: Dazy, their items were a size larger. I also don't like SHEIN ships parcels through random couriers. If possible add option to chose a courier. Lastly, I recommend giving out freebies more often at a least value of total purchases."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My app keeps getting logged out and I keep losing order details. From 20 days I'm trying to return a couple of things I ordered way before the lockdown. 1. I have received these clothes recently. 2. They don't fit me. 3. The app won't let me return it cause it's way past the date 4. Nobody in the costumer care is recieving my call. This is seriously the worse experience I have had on any shopping app so far.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's just ok. Sometimes a less aggressive mktg approach in exchange for being easier to FIND what you're actually ready to buy -WHEN you're actually ready to TAKE BUYING action ( DIRECTIONAL adv vs Creative adv ) is difficult. Bad for customers who have discretionary income & just want to (for example:quickly refer to an item in past orders to ensure fit/ etc w new item u are about to buy ) is just too difficult. Don't allow incentives to become prohibitive to buy an item! Lose potential rev
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein! As a plus sized woman it's so great to be able to buy nice looking, affordable clothing. I've been ordering from them for about a year now and I've never had them take more than 2 weeks to get my packages. Here's the kicker, NEVER go by basic sizes. ALWAYS check the size chart."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy buying from SHEIN, there's something for everyone, be it DIY, toys, jewellery, which I buy quite a bit of, I'm also very pleased with clothes for adults and kids, true to UK sizing. Earn points to buy anything you like. Money off coupons. This is a really great app, has gifts for all occasions, and if you're on a low budget like me, I highly recommend you to getting this app. Happy Shopping!!😊🛒🎁👚👗💍👍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It didn't take me long to understand the app..the short cuts and also all the last minute SALES.. ordered 3 times and each order has about 4 items or more. Very surprised how nice and exact the clothes especially to it's description as on the photos. Enjoyed it. If disappointed it's only minor item. ❤
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm plus size, an im not talking size 18 hourglass figure plus size. I'm talking size 24 curves everywhere thick thighs, waist and hips but all around thick. I have a hard time ordering from places because of where my weight sits. But I figured I'd give shein a try. An to be honest I don't regret it one bit. I've ordered a couple times from them. First time being a trendy corduroy skirt that fit perfectly and just recently and engagement/reception dress and white bow to match. They were perfect!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really like Shein, it's a fun app and fun things to buy, great sales and depending on your likes on things a wide variety...I use it a lot. I also contacted customer service on an item and boom within minutes my issue on a hair piece was solved, I always get great discounts and appreciate the little extra discount I get by making reviews. I have always received my orders early... And that's great. You have to pay attention to sizes so it's nice to see others reviews it always helps."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I haven't ordered from the app yet, but it's very easy to navigate. The one thing I dislike is that after I'm done viewing an item it takes me all the way back to the beginning instead of where I left off and then I have to scroll all the way back down again through the same items. That's a reason why I haven't ordered from the app yet."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love, this app, before I order goods from aliexpress, but now aliexpress shipping is too expensive for our country, and didn't receive most of the items. Also it take long periods. But shopping with shein is most wonderful experience I ever made, but I hope you can make free shipping at least $100, because, I buy goods for my own needs, and $200 is little bit expensive for us.🥺 ❤️"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good experience so far, ordered a couple of items from the app, happy with the quality and size, only had one bad item that was massive, so I think an improvement on the size guide would help, to have UK sizes not just small medium and large. Shipping is fairly quick, overall happy."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This place has amazing beautiful trends for every style and every taste, everything is true to size, great quality just like in the pics everthing looks in person. I have used this app for a year and I recommend it to everyone you won't regret it. BTW great costumer service ❤️I love this creative website where u can find the right clothes to express your artistic self."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I swear these days I've been checking on my points being taken away and I don't know why???? Everytime I try to gain more points by checking them every single morning and only to see the number of my points lowering more and more, which is very irritating."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Fabulous!!! Most importantly are size availability with updated color choices. I prefer the bold colors of all the garments that are presented well on most models. Looking forward to all the upcoming seasonal fashions especially the casual and semiformal dresses.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great items at great prices! Careful it can be addictive! You get points for checking in, marking your delivery received and reviewing purchases then you can use those points to buy more stuff!! They often have free delivery days but I usually buy enough to qualify for free shipping! If you see something that you want on Amazon or something, check Shein first! They will usually have it at a fraction of the price! Shipping is pretty quick as well usually within a couple weeks, often sooner!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Easy to find things I want, simple ordering process, I absolutely love that I can use Afterpay, I love the clothes, various items I bought, and they have speedy shipping! Especially since I order from them so much. I really enjoy the daily check in points and the bonus points you get for certain events. Their coupons are very helpful too. I highly recommend this app!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,the products are too expensive 😩
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Sometimes the descriptions aren't up to par. There's been a few times I ordered some skirts and they turned out to be skorts and nowhere in the ad or descriptions did it state this. And I wish they had bigger shoes for us with the big feet. LOL but besides that it's a good app with pretty good quality clothes especially for the prices you are paying.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Not gonna lie I like the layout of the app it's easy to use Except when I buy things I never receive them and customer service help is non existent it's just stupid robots who don't know anything..can barely construct understandable sentences let alone understand what ur trying to tell them
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My mam ordered items, packaged ""arrived"" at someone else's house and they signed for it. My mam got nothing and shein says it was ""delivered"" and refuse to give a refund even though she got nothing. They won't tell her where it was delivered, who signed for it. Disgusting customer service, will never use shein again. Also take note of the brain dead repetitive replies under the reviews in playstore. It's a joke!!! Almost the same answer every time!!! They don't give a damn about customers!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If I could only give zero stars. My last order never arrived and it had been a month. After reordering the same product, IT STILL DIDNT ARRIVE! For the second time in a row! There are no valid contact numbers and absolutely no possibilities of getting in touch with you. The 24 / 7 helpline is useless. Absolutely dissapointed with your service. Have lost all my respect for shein. I Need a replacement order ASAP with assurance/guarantee as i have already wasted 2months of time and energy in this."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love shooping from Shein , but there a problem about size suggestions, for example if you need Sweatpants and you need top and pants size different, there's no way to contact Shein I hope this problem will be resolved soon, thanks"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Overall good app, and I love the store. Problem is waaaaaay too many emails and notifications - and you can't alter it for either. It's all or nothing. Super annoying to get notifications for sales that don't include their curve range, as it just doesn't apply to me."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have placed an order with a few items on a thursday i have already paid for it and all i log on to my app on monday to see if it has been sent off. To my surprise one of my items that i have already PURCHASED has been refunded as its not in stock. Yes i am disappointed as this was an item i was looking forward to the most. I won't be buying anything else from here. It seems like their warehouse and product-in-stock tracking is terrible. Student email didn't work for discount either
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is an excellent app. The clothes are so affordable- nothing is more than $60. You are able to gain points daily for nothing which you can spend on your order. Constant free shipping & easy returns. Shipping takes about 10 days when you're a frequent buyer. You're able to play the games to gain points, create fashion boards, see how others put together outfits & watch live shopping videos (like HSN)."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My packages always arrive early or on time, their make up line is absolutely wonderful, clothing and lingerie for every size that make you feel empowered and stunning. Highly recommend checking them out if looking to have a fashion/ lifestyle change. They offer a variety of styles in clothing, as well as offer other items and accessories to style your new wardrobe with all for very reasonable prices. Go check them out now!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Very easy to order as well as the follow thru all the way to processing payment. Never had a problem in trying to return an item as well. I am having a little problem in the sizing department. Love fashion and the styles are such that you do not see anywhere else. Shipping is made easy as well. Love to just brouse sometimes.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app works fine, its the clothes that can be bad. You normally pay for what you get;its cheap so, it made cheaply. There's normally something that not quite right about a place of clothes. For example one of these things happen: its not really an A line dreese, there not really a shape to the dreese, the material does mach the photo (a little worse quality) or the sewing is just messy. The photos are taken in a way that makes it hard to realy see what your getting. Readily find good clothes"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The SHEIN mobile app is an excellent means to browse and also get designs for females, males, youngsters, and also Contour! There more than 20,000 designs to pick from, as well as the app is very easy to utilize with a search feature as well as filters to help you find what you're seeking. You can likewise keep an eye on your orders and favored products, and share relate to friends."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I don't know what happened suddenly but the service has declined so much. I'm truly very disappointed. I returned a particular item. It was picked up and i got the receipt but there is no trace of the item ever being bought on my account now. And the customer service has had me on hold for forever! So, you get your item back but don't have the ethics to refund the money or even convey information about the relevant refund?! I'm genuinely very disappointed. Be sharing the incident with friends."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Enjoyed shopping with extra off from my daily coins, but dress materials can be a turn off some times. Giving 3 stars cause they didn't post my review for my products yet! And I gave them 5 and 4 stars for those. I didn't get any coins as proposed in the terms for reviews Did order a set of items again during this lockdown. Let's see how does it treat me this time"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app is great! Many clothing options! But the thing that I don't like is that some items are only available in the US. For example I really like the shein X hello kitty collection but it's not available in my country so I cannot buy anything from it. I find that kind of unfair.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Super duper! Love the app, it's easy to navigate. Collection of clothes is AMAZING! I got my 1st parecel within 10 days of ordering. Very good material and fit. For the price I paid, it was a steal! Just couple of recommendations: Please keep more pant options for people with bigger waist but smaller height, most pants of L size I saw on app were ideal for taller people (I am 5.3 feet tall). Secondly, please keep some blouses that has summer friendly fabric without showing too much skin."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Have been using this app for about 1.5 years. Kind of regret it as I've spent more that I should. However, my experience with the interface and ways to go from one tab to the next, is good. There are a number of ""rooms"" I don't get, but I'm not much into getting freebies as other people are, so they are of no consequence to me. If talking about the brand, the quality of the clothes is low and cheap except for underwear and bathing suits. Those have been amazing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So far, since I've been using the app, I love it and the clothes. It's my go to for when I want cheap but cute clothes to add to my wardrobe. Not everything is amazing quality, but it's still very cute so I love it regardless. To clarify, most things I've bought is good quality- only a little is not. It's a gateway for me to dress how I want(to an extent) without murdering my wallet since I really value fashion and clothes. (I also like that there's always coupons and deals, etc etc)."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like it. I had to do a whole nother login and that totally blew. It was because I couldn't change my phone number after it was changed. I tried contacting CS but I ended just making another one. The app sucks cuz it won't stay on the page you're looking at, it goes all the way back after you've viewed. Other than that, 5 stars for cheap clothes and yay Klarna!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,A real lovely app. I ordered things and the delivery was delivered promptly and have so many beautiful things you can become a shopaholic ...definitely a very happy customer indeed ...Sandra Sandy Pereira .....
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A lot more convenient at times compared to the website. Only problem is that the app tends to buffer and take longer time to load. This often led to ""timeouts"" and items not being added to the bag. Otherwise this app is amazing and very well organized!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"First site (& maybe even store) where I feel comfortable ordering as a plus size chick. I check the size charts, but think reading the reviews is the most important. As a plus size woman with an hourglass shape it is so hard to shop online and not freak out about ordering more than one thing.. I love shopping with Shein. It makes me feel beautiful and excited to dress how I actually want to. Somedays when I get an order it's like confidence in a box!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love this app and this website. I wanted to return an item and because I am a valued customer I was chosen at random to have the option of keeping the item and still receiving a full refund! (This is not something that happens all of the time but I appreciate the acknowledgment and opportunity. There's always deals going on from their already great prices to their discount codes . On my last order they even threw in a free Katy Perry CD! I will continue to shop Shein forever!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,IWILL NEVER ORDER FROM THIS APP AGAIN GOT MY ORDER WRONG OVER CHARGE ME AND THERE'S NO CUSTOMER SERVICE IT TAKE YOU IN CIRCLES DON'T TRUST THIS APP IT'S NOT THE WAY TO DO BUSINESS THE BETTER BUSINESS NEED TO BE INVOLVED
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm going broke because of shein. I love their items. Great shipping. Great quality. Great sizing. Great customer service and returns. Awesome points system. And CUTE styles of clothing, shoes, jewelry, and accessories. Even some home items! Shein is by far my favorite place to shop."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My first experience was great but on my second order the package was showing delivered but I have not received any package I am upset about the situation I tried to reach out to someone to get a refund but there is no one to even talk to about the situation
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've been shopping here a long time. Most of the clothes have been excellent some are okay and might need a slip or something because see through. Read reviews and look at customer photos of each item. Usually really helpful. Only had 1 return out of probably 100 items bought and had 0 issues was super easy.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It is literally an amazing app.. You can find stuff in categories also every category could have the new in and the general ones.. You can filter after u search for something and the dilevery is pretty good and comes on time or even before with a good time..would highly recommend it.. Thank you shein.. You saved my style and wallet 😂💜
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I ordered I pay all but when I see the checklist of my ordered that I purchased some of it are missing please do something
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm a plus size girl and was really struggling to find beautiful clothing. I dread buying close. But then I found out about Shein and my life and fashion sense changed. The outfits are beautiful and compliments my body. I can find underwater, clothes, shoes everything in one place. I love it. Thank you all for the life changing experience. Now I love shopping for my clothes and everyday needs."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I put off buying from them for so long because I assumed they were a scam/""dollar store quality"", but I was amazed to find I loved all 8 items in my first order! Love their selection of graphic t-shirts, it is hard to find a good selection of funny t-shirt slogans in plus size - but their shirts fit me perfectly. Very impressed by their duochrome eyeliner, better staying power than expensive brands. Really like their frequent free shipping deals, too."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really like it. You do need to keep an eye on the material and sizing, but it has gotten a lot better than a year ago. It seems to have everything I'm looking for from travel items, kids' clothes, make-up, and lots of sales. The app is really easy to set up and use, there's pictures and reviews for everything. The postage is reasonable, and it takes just under 2 weeks to arrive, so not bad really"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Clothes are good, must read the reviews before you buy. Shipping has always been fast for me as well They have a section where you can apply to get the clothes for free, but you never get approved. They also have a points system, but they expire, I just lost 57 points!! FIFTY SEVEN! I'm conflicted as to whether I continue to shop here or not."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really like SHEIN. It gives you tons of options for sizes it has regular sizes, plus sizes, women's, men's and children's. Plus it has make up, accessories, room decor and much more. It is also very cheap and shipping is only $3.99 or free depending on what level of shopping your on. You also check in daily for points."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really like the things here and the prices but I must say that a lot of the white clothing come slightly see-through, overall the app is quite organized and easy to navigate through and they even give you a shipping guarantee which a lot of other websites don't but that is on my opinion and everyone has different experiences 🙃"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app for shopping, The downs are that some clothes are smaller than the actual size and some clothes are not the best quality for example after washing them one or few times they tend to loose color, shrink, or torn make sure to be carefull washing. In overall returns, customer service, and app is well desingned. Definetively a cheap and fast way to upgrade your fashion. Shipping can take few days but still better than most online stores."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"So basically the products are made out of very delicate and cheap materials, so it may look nice but it quite literally needs to be kept away from anything that will cause any sort of mark. Also the clothing stains too easily and the sizes aren't really accurate in the first place. Their coupon system is dope af though so that's a +'s but other than that it is way too expensive and the prices add up quickly. I'm running out of room so that's my review. Shein is mid 🤷🏾🤷🏾🤷🏾"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My experience with this app is very bad I hadn't received my order it's been more than 70 days. I get that they were unable to deliver my order due to lockdown but even after that when I tried to cancel my order the won't let me neither they are giving any response on the phone number they provided. I am gonna complaint against this app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Clothes are okay but but return policies are really irritating. You need to keep on calling customer care for every single aspects. Don't buy if you don't want to waste money for every return. Sizes are the main issue..And no easy return and exchange. Myntra services are quite fast and easy to opt. If you lot of time to chat with customer care then you can go for this app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love SheIn. They are fast, cheap, and accurate. This site is a perfect way to experiment with style or hop on the latest trend without paying an arm and a leg. I have found some amazing pieces, and it has helped me rebuild my wardrobe on a limited budget. (I recently lost 75lbs in a year, and though that's great...I does a number on your wallet buying new clothes every couple of months.) Just pay attention to sizing PER item, and read reviews and you'll be golden."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like this app a lot, it's easy to use and everything. If you are looking to purchase anything I'd look at the measurements to make sure(especially with plus) and look at reviews. It's super nice to be able to find affordable plus size items and the shipping is really nice. I've made multiple purchases and never had an issue."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Low prices, good quality material, what you see in the pictures is exactly what you get. Generally arrives before expected and I love all the ways you can make points to save money towards your next purchase. Very satisfying, wish they had a bit more regular & long length of the crop tops as I really like them but am too old to have my belly on display."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great value for money. And such a variety. And very affordable. Unfortunately I've had no luck with buying nickers. They aren't true to size, well not for my shape anyway. Often some clothing items sell out. And I just think, oh ok is that it. It would great to know if items are going to be restocked again. Overall I love shopping with Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Everything is perfect from shein that I have gotten, definitely check the sizing chart to make sure you get the right fit. I am extremely happy that i can get designer style stuff for a great price and it was great quality. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to upgrade their wardrobe or into fashion."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app. However, I do wish that the ""Track Order"" and ""Cancel Order"" were not beside each other. I have normal sized fingers, and I'm afraid I might hit the Cancel Order instead of Track Order. Other than that, the app itself is wonderful, much easier to navigate the wesbite."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Images are not getting load as it used to before update. And most of pictures are edited so can't really rely on all the materials in clothing, especially. (they have same model and same pose but a different colour cloth to show multiple colours of the same item.) Over all I like the app. I've bought few things and I'm satisfied but those items aren't all from clothing. I had to analyze and go through the reviews a lot and thn I buy."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"you can't use all your points, they have maximum policy. The points you can used is only 20%. I hope they bring it back like before"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great selection of products at good prices. My tween loves browsing the clothes. I find it a little hard to navigate because the search function sometimes gives unexpected results but overall very good. Also when I needed to cancel and refund an order it all happened quickly and seamlessly.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Shein lies and steals your stuff I order 15 items and they refuse to give me back my money when it was not received your delivery gets stolen and they refuse to give you back any money I'm saying this because I don't want it to happen to anyone else do not buy from shein there terrible It's a 50/50 chance you'll get your stuff too risky for your wallet
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"App doesn't sync up to desktop when signed in to both. I had to manually enter my shopping bag from the desktop into the app for the extra points. It only took a couple minutes, but it would nice to have it sync like every site I have an account with."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The best app for buying clothes. The clothes are exactly as on pictures good quality and great prices. I love that people can post their photos in the clothes so you can actually see it how it looks in real and can see what size you would need. Also free return if it doesnt fit or you dont like. Highly recommended really i shop now only here
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Some of Shein's plus-size dresses and skirts are really adorable, but they're so dang short! It's frustrating to find the perfect style of dress only to realize it's about 4"" too short. Other than that, I've liked just about everything I've bought."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Fake products, very low quality. They will take your money and send you a fake knockoff. DO NOT BUY HERE!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Everything I have ordered fits perfect, material is always great,the prices are outstanding I cannot stay off the app..I had to see what the hype was all about and it didn't disappoint! I looked the best I've ever looked for my 40th birthday with 2 spectacular dresses from shein..I don't want to buy clothes anywhere else!!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,First I'd say wow amazingly cute items. Ordering is pretty clear and easy. The items come so fast. I ordered and got my order in 6 days. I've since kept ordering and couldn't be happier with the quality. So many options and for a steal. Orders come to me as ordered. Nothing missing. I really would give it a try. You really have tooo.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Customer support services are very bad and totally useless!! I spent more than an hour trying to get support, but without any help!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Could be less frequent in spamming promos, and more customization in Notification settings pls. Like I want to receive app notification abt my order status but not on promos. Love the app feature where I can swipe the pics on the listing to see other pics without having to tap into each product first. Good quality & affordable fashion. Keep up the good work."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Wide range of designs which fit well according to the sizes quoted. Materials are as listed in the advert, choice of materials and colours are amazingly perfect. Quality is also very good and stitching is very fine most of the time. Will recommend the choice dresses and blouses to everyone as it looks great and has a class of its own. Very outstanding and attractive for both office wear and also for functions. Delivery has been as scheduled and I am personally satisfied with Shein fashion"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The BEST app ever, I love it so much. Everything arrives in a timely manner when it's said to arrive or sometimes even earlier and is usually good quality:) the only reason I gave this 4 stars is because i wish it had dark mode so I could go shopping in my free time (which is usually at night) without killing my eyes. But I absolutely love otherwise! 💞"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Easy & convenient...high prices
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great products,good quality. I had an order get lost. Shein notified me of the issue and asked if I wanted to cancel or reorder. I chose to reorder, and a few of the items were now out of stock. My money was refunded for those items. Shein also, for the troubles, rewarded me with points!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Amazing finds when you can find them! But trying to find your size can be quite difficult they have made it easier with having their curve clothing lines. Always read reviews, people will generally tell you if it is too small or large. Over all prices vary but they give out good discounts all the time so it really helps with cost. Sometimes you forget you ordered something as it can take a while to ship to you buts its like a nice surprise present curated to yourself XD"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The collection is amazing but the only reason I'm giving this a 2-star is because the customer service is absolutely ridiculous. They dont pick the call and all this automated Bot says manual service isn't available...and I'm here trying to know where is my package from the past one month. Also I have been trying to text them through the app but in vain. Please tell me what's the progress of my package.ugh.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Affordable, afterpay available and i love that they have everything especially curve+ plus for women. Also i get to be rewarded with a lot of discounts after every reviews and every orders. I love it and my teenage daughter is thrilled with all the good stuffs that we buy from Shein. We're going to stick to Shein. Best service and delivery on time. Love the fact that orders arrive on time or before scheduled arrival date. No disappointments for me. Shein all the way."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Their clothes are hit or miss, they range from very high quality to very low quality. Definitally look at the reviews before buying anything, and they could work on their return system. Overall I have really enjoyed shopping there and would definitely recomend!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very reluctant to buy heard stories on quality of clothing not so good. However I decided for myself and ordered a few items , and the quality was beautiful the fit perfect and there are so many designs to choose from and for any age. The best thing for me is that iam always looking for long sleeved tops and Shein has every type of sleeve there is lol. I have ordered again and cant wait . Delivery is longer but that's to be expected gives you more of a surprise.Thank you Shein"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I actually like shopping here! It's a hit or miss, for me it's mostly hit. I found a lot of fun dresses and sandals. True to fit, some of the fabrics are thin, but will be great this summer. I had a lot of shipments from them already, and always comes in time, sometimes early. Only a couple of disappointing choices, they sent me things that are far from what I ordered. Did a review, gave the clothes to someone, it's on sale anyways. I hope it doesn't happen again. Overall, this site is great!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"On two separate occasions I have tried to order products from this company. On four occasions my packages keep getting incorrectly shipped. Their Representatives for some reason for my orders do not seem to know how to address correctly so that I get my packages. Because of incompetence I have lost two items that I really wanted. I really wish I would have looked at all of the negative reviews for this company, it probably would have saved me the headache of trying to purchase anything."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love, Love, Love this app. It's so simple to use and the deal's and clothes are simply amazing! The clothes are absolutely beautiful, classy, sophisticated, up to trend, for like they say, for a price that is unbeatable anywhere else. The way you can gain money on the app to use toward your purchase is very very handy especially in today's economy! They also delivered all of my purchases even before the set time it was to be here, almost 5 day's before I expected which was great! Easy to use"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"only have had 3 or 4 things not being up to par compared to the other hundred items I've purchased...nice items for good prices...you just have to know you size..I reccomend a measuring tape with the way their sizes run. I've bought from pretty much every category as well and those products are different and useful, I recommend checking out all tabs ..never know what you'll find!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Can't get a refund on items don't fix need to return information
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's a company that offers a very fast delivery to you after ordering.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Shein has good and cheap products, but finding a size that fits is very hard. But the worst part is that you have to PAY SHIPPING COSTS when REFUNDING items. This can be a bunch of money which is stupid. These are reasons I don't want to shop at Shein again as the return shipping costs with tracking numbers are so expensive."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I LOVE shein! Actual delivery dates have always been ahead of estimated delivery times. They are packaged so nicely. Make sure you know your size on items bc thats where you can make mistakes. Orders always come with instructions on how to return material so easy. You can get credit in your account to use on future purchases or they refund your money. I have loved.so much everything I've bought from here from house light decors, shoes boots high heels, dresses skirts gorgeous unique tops ect."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Overall I like this app. Especially the curve-plus section. Everything for the most part has been true to size. BUT one red flag for me is I ordered a lingerie item that was defective (missing button) and had already WORN it. I informed customer service of this but only wanted to issue me a half refund unless I RETURNED A WORN LINGERIE ITEM. I kept it and only got a half refund, and was not happy about it. Their supervisor was ""unavailable"". Be weary about what you buy from them. WashItemsBefore"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The only thing I wish they would do is stop using terrible courier services, otherwise I love it. It has lots of options that are budget friendly, it offers afterpay and the customer support is also fantastic. If it weren't for the courier issues I would rate it 5 stars ✨️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"They do have cheap products sure but honestly it gives me stress having to pray when I'm expecting an order because they tend to not pay attention to what they send out to the customer, a few months ago they send me the wrong item and now I ordered a coat with fur for my trip which is in a few days and the fur on the hood was not attached, I contacted to ask them to send it or return the item and of course they can't bother so they asked me to return even though I wanted the furry part."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The price problem is Ok when discounted, but shipping and fees are expensive when COD, cheaper when paying online cards. The worst thing is the delivery time up to two weeks, OMG. Sometimes feel worried if the order has been paid online, afraid of being unsafe because of the length of time the goods are received due to the length of delivery. Please fix the delivery problem even more expedited."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great application. Houses a variety of fashion items, not limited to clothing. You have a wishlist of items you like and a cart of items you'd like to purchase, but you can also tick the items you're definitely buying from the cart. You pay customs duty a week post placing your order but they send a message prior to calling and they call too. The only let down is waiting 2-3+ weeks for delivery. Buffalo Logistics delays delivery (even by a month) even when Shein is early."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I order a lot of stuff like clothes, stickers, school supplies from the SHEIN app and they have so much variety, of course not everything is this amazing quality but for most of the products I have bought the quality is good, some of them are just meh but for the price I think that's okey, I have received 1 product damaged but I have made more than 10 orders so that's not so bad"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"You really can't go wrong for the prices! I've ordered from shein twice and have not experienced any delivery issues. A few of the items I bought were made wrong but for the price, I couldn't be bothered to go through the hassle of returning them so I altered and fixed them myself and now have a few unique pieces. I'll definitely order again, I already have a lot in my basket lol."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like shein jewelrys And clothes, shoes and bag's.. I like also the service of Shein on time . I like all the products.. 👍👍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I ordered a quite afew items and it said it was delivered. I checked for a week and followed up with the PO and with Shein itself. They said it showed delivered, it was...to a different state! I've been back and forth trying to get my refund for months and have failed. I've sent them pics of the delivery address vs my mailing, which are different, but still no refund. Prices are excellent and quality is good but this is enough not to order anymore unfortunately."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Worst app at present. I have been using shein app for over a year now and it has been a great experience so far. The customer service used to be great if there ever was an issue. The daily check in points don't get added correctly. Edit: the points issue is fixed but cannot place an order now as it triggers their so called fraud protection system and I'm being asked for driver's license and other important stuff, will never shop again!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Some clothes are great and comfortable.. I have recently purchased a couple of shirts that made me very itchy. This never has happened with their pants only their shirts. I'm not sure what this issue is. But i'm not sure if I will continue shopping
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great site for affordable,lovely clothes. Always got something on there you can't find on the high street shop so you know you look different from the crowd. The jewellery selection is great too,lots of fun pieces.Homeware is full of things you never knew you needed. 😉 Plenty of ways to pay for for your items,fast delivery. Only down side is the returns is a but hard to work out. I've just ended up giving stuff away to friends instead of trying to figure it out 😁"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Don't waist your time some of the items are decent quality most of them are bad and have to be sent back not to mention their ""free"" stuff to get ""free"" games doesn't even give you the items you go from 0.1% to 0.09% and you can check in every single day and still not get the item... this is a waste of time don't get it"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's pretty good. Great clothing, amazing quality, cheap prices, my only problem is that when I tried using 100 points along with a coupon to submit an order, it stated that I still needed to choose a payment method (credit/debit card, google pay, etc.) At the time I'm purchasing, standard shipping is free for all orders, so that can't be why I still need to choose a card to use. Points are used to pay for products for free, so why would I still need a payment method?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I had three orders which didn't arrive. I got a minimal amount back minus post and packaging for one (it was not delivered so why should I pay for delivery) and nothing for the other two. I won't buy anything from any company on line now. Good luck trying to contact them, they do nothing and you can't talk to anyone. Scam"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I am rating this 0 not 1! You don't deserve to have a rating. I ordered a nice blouse and pants. The package was delivered and I paid it. When I opened the package it was a different item. It looks like dirty rags! My real order is now in the sorting center and I paid for items that I didn't order! I called the rider but he refused to give me his name. I suspect I was duped. The rider created a n order that I never ordered so he can get my money! Customer service sucks. Never order here!!!!!!!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love this app ! There's always deals and flash sales. Everything is cheap! They have a lot of different categories to go through. I recently got a free patio set!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am disgusted with this company. I put an order in on Feb 2nd. Paid for Express delivery (2 -4 days). March 9th my tracking number says the order was delivered. NO, IT WAS NOT. Somebody is always home at my house and morning had come and none of the shipping companies recognize my tracking number. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Super easy to use app. No bugs, interface COULD be better, filter search is p detailed but sometimes not the smartest if I'm nitpicking but in all honesty, I'm not complaining at all. For the price of the items they are selling and the service they provide. 100% for everything."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's a pretty good shipping app. I've never received a problem with shipping and it's always arrived earlier than it was supposed to. The quality of the items honestly varies but good for the prices. App offers discounts too which is great.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Show us the material to on the object details before we buy because what you ordered is different from what they bring
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Too much spam notification, like literally every hour."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have usually had good experience of shopping on shein. I like the collection and the best thing is the availability of so many reviews with pictures that I could easily figure out how the apparel is going to fare out. In all, i like shein. I want them to stock in more formal wear too."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Been buying a lot of merchandise from this app and I love it. Very good prices too. Although to be fair some items are smaller than described. Usually there's a size chart which will let you see measurements of clothing but still too reduced. And some clothing with a lot of static even when washed. Still very beautiful merch. Check them out for yourselves.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Shein is the best online shop ever according to my experience ..i advice to shop we them if you want anything online and thank me later..i have ordered several things and it had never disappointed me in anyway..she in have quality products .
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"All the things I've gotten so far have been good quality, right as they are on imagine and completely accurate to their description. The app works really well and is categorised well. Shipping is also incredibly fast as some of my really large packages arrived in less than two weeks! Definitely a huge fan!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love shein! I have ordered about 6 times and everytime I order, it comes withing about a week which is amazing. The fabric of the clothes are so comfortable and the sizes fit perfectly. I highly recommend this app. I never use to be so interested in going clothes shopping or getting dressed up nicely but this app has made me love clothes so much❤️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Edit: ok I got my items. Both were too small. Like way too small. I ordered a large and could barely fit these over my head. I stand by what I said. Its Wish for clothes. Which also means a waste of money and time. Basically its Wish but with more clothes? I'm going to wait for what I ordered to come in and then I'll update my review. The clothes were cheap so hopefully they'll hold up. In one of the ads I saw for this app, they had some misspellings which is an offputting sign to me."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My favourite app to order from. Clothes are beautiful, love how the search options works, prices are cheap and fits are usually great! Surprisingly good quality and love being able to read other people's reviews and see how the clothes fit their bodies. (Only negative is they can take a bit of time to arrive during covid, but that's hardly their fault)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Honestly one of the first application from abroad that is legit. Shipping, including delivery took less than expected, 13 days to be exact. Quality is perfect, exactly as pictured. Reviews are one one of finding out about the quality of the clothing, and they are accurate. Sizing is mostly big, and I've had to downside, for a more oversized look, then you can go for your size. One way to make sure you don't get it wrong, just measure yourself. Love the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Easy to use app. Generally very good filters given the amount of product they have. The quality of customer reviews is very good. Best is the specific size measurements on each item so you know what to get as the sizing is not consistent across the items. So easy to return. My go to app for clothes shopping for me and the kids
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Shein is absolutely amazing. The app is easy to use and navigate. All my deliveries have always come at least a week early. The clothes are surprisingly good quality despite the usually low cost. The sizing of the clothes has always been on point for me and the sizing charts on the app are very useful.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great shopping app. Fabulous clothes at reasonable prices. Some nice bargains to be had. You can gain money off points towards your next purchase by leaving reviews which is great. Simple and easy to use. On average its a 6-7 day delivery wait for standard shipping and you can even use Klarna and pay in 30days if you are unsure if you want to keep the clothes. Overall really good app and shopping experience.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Horrible way to get DATA from users using the invite mechanics. Fake game fake spin etc.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is my favorite online shopping app. So far I'm happy for all the items that I've purchased, there's a lot of varieties to choose from and also the reviews/feedbacks of the customers really gives me an idea if its worth it or not. There's also a lot of discounts and promos. 4 stars only coz unfortunately, some of the items/sizes are out of stock and it's fast pacing. Delivery is quite long and it takes time."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My phone overheard my pal talking about Shein. Then boom, Shein. Downloaded and hooked. Love the stock. The deals. First order arrived and the quality was better than expected. Great place to buy necessities at a cheaper price. Shipping was under 2 weeks. Love the points system and deals. Happy customer here."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Edit: Still trash. No dark mode. They ruined the purchasing experience by splitting your cart into separate stores just like AliExpress and now not everything is eligible for coupons but they won't tell you what is, they just say you need to add (x) amount more of ""eligible items."" Went from 5 stars to 1 because I got a minimum of TWENTY notifications on black Friday, ONE EVERY HOUR! I simply had to disable all notifications in system settings..Disgusting behavior."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love it! I go on this app daily and purchase from it often. I have rarely had an issue, and the app itself is pretty great, better than the browser version. It can be better though! I feel like it could be better organized and show the pages in a more clear way but for general shopping it's great!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's been ok. But I can't return or get a refund for my necklace that broke. Bummer. I've gotten good items though
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love SheIn it's just some of the sizing on the shoe. Maybe for the shark slides if they when down to little kids sizes that would be great. Clothes are amazing. Accessories are adorable. Maybe on the phone cases add android ones!!! All of the pricing are reasonable. Like $5 on a shirt not bad. Like other big stores it's like $20.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love Shein. I had one problem with an order (split parcel) around Christmas but what didn't arrive I was fully refunded for. Shein gets alot of negative feedback but I have way more positive things to say about them than negative. 95% of the items are perfect the ones that are not I have regifted (sizing). Prices are so good. Give them a go ♥️🇮🇪
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"My first order, I only received one of two peices. There is no direct contact phone number. Messaged on the app to contact an agent. Got a message text service. Next day received an email. They wanted me to take a photo of my items. Then the resolution was for them to arrange a free shipping rerurn for what I received before I get my full order. Maybe its just me but wouldnt it make more sense to send the missing conponant rather than me waiting even longer? Not a good first impression...."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This online shopping app is so amazing. The shop managers are up and doing, trustworthy, and reliable. They have never failed to impress my patronising them. The dresses are just the same way as in the pictures, both the material and the colors. I recommend Shein to anyone looking forward to shopping online. You will never regret passing by them. Kudos Shein!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shein does a great job with packaging and is very consistent with coupons and showing the latest trends, although some things might be thin but you get what you pay for this app is really really good I haven't had any problems whatsoever with it sense I downloaded it, very cheap but very cute and I doubted their jeans...don't do that if you like a pair of jeans get them they are such great quality, hope you liked my review:)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Always a great experience shopping on this site. The prices are unbeatable and they offer lots of variety of stuff, the only thing I would like to see improved is the shipping times for different countries if it could be a bit faster even on the standard shipping but other than that I love this app and recommend it to everyone."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was very dubious about online shopping as you hear so many horror stories, but shein has restored my faith. It's so easy to use and there's loads to browse. Prices are very reasonable with some stuff dirt cheap,plus the perks of vouchers and points. Would highly recommend to anyone. Delivery is pretty quick with most things arriving before the due date."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"A very reliable and easy to use app. I'm not sure why there is such emphasis on the curve section but although Shein petite exists, it doesn't seem to be a section on its own. At 5ft1"" I find this a bit disappointing. A wide feet range would also be cool! Great range of womens clothing...found the mens a bit limited."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,When I order from shein online website I get everything that I order within 10 days I like the way they ship online
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is a genuin and trusted online shop so i recommend 100%.everyday i ordered a things and delivery is very quickly.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love the clothes! Especially the lounge 2 & 3 PC outfits for $20 give or take. The only thing I don't like is that you have to pay shipping after your first return which is 7.99 each time after your first return. Any outfit or piece of clothing you order isn't always true to size due to who the seller is and I'd probably oder more if I didn't have $8 taken off my return refund due to sizing issues which they clearly state not every item is true to size.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shipping times are getting better. I've liked all of my purchases so far. You have to go by the measurements when you click on the sizes. But as long as you follow the measurements, you will always get the correct size. And the things that I've ordered have looked exactly as pictured on the app. The customer service is actually quite nice and very responsive."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Nice collection you have but there are lots of dis qualities which are not making it a popular place to buy clothes. The sizes are very confusing. Somethings fit us in L others fit in XL or XXL. Your free shipping shopping price is very high. Other sites have very low price for free shipping. You charge a fees while returning any item which is senseless.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have found this app very easy to use, I believe that the quality of their items are better than some bought in the shops (you just need to wait a little longer for them). I have replaced all my tops, jumpers and coats through this site and to count have only (3)three didn't turn out to what they said. I would recommend this app to anyone who asked and more."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Beautiful clothing that fits the fancy of all types. Some things are you get what you pay for, but still cute. Material can be a good or bad surprise, but 90% of the time, I'm very happy with the quality, because I read reviews and know what I'm getting into. Returns are super easy and their customer service is phenomenal. PLEASE people, post pics in your revs to help others! Also, don't sleep on their home and art section. Good stuff."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"On the whole it's not too bad but the biggest failing is the description of item to be purchased. The photos are mostly showing models posing to show themselves off not to show the item of clothing to best effect and it's impossible to zo the picture to see what the fabric is like. Just saying polyester is not detail enough, we need to be able to see how that fibre has been used. So often it's down to customer reviews to be able to get a better sense. What is the point of 5 pictures all showing"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a brilliant app. It is easy and fun to use, with a great plus range for women rather than hunting for your size in the regular womens section. The time to receive the items is quite quick, considering they tend to come from China and the sizing is accurate. The quality is pretty good and the fact you can refund is great. I've used the refund and it takes about 7 working days, which I can't grumble about"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Horrible Customer service by Shein. The automated bot doesn't comprehend the problem. Hardly any refreshed tracking updates. Also horrible delivery system. The worst in the industry on e-commerce. Avoid downloading the app. Not worth the delay. I'd ordered a sweater before Christmas. Now it's 10 days after New year's, winter almost on the verge of ending but no updates regarding my sweater. Absolute callous handling of commitment to deliver products to customers. Disgusting. Order no :CPX100579"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love the app, it's very easy to navigate and prices are affordable. My absolute favorite shopping app, however I really wish that you could put your saved items into different categories/folders as that is the only downside!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Its good but toooo much ads on my phone
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. The clothes are inexpensive and they have a lot of options for plus size people. The material of the clothing is great as well. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the length of the sleeve of some tops are not long enough for tall people. I am 5'7"" and have long arms. Some of the long-sleeved shirts I have purchased from this app have been too short. They stop about 2-3 inches above my wrist. I just roll them up and use them as half sleeve shirts."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've shopped on Shein for a few years. I'm pretty impressed with their products - some are genius. I tend to do a massive order. Naturally some things get sent back (not always), but it's simple to send things back too. If you're looking for a next day delivery, this isn't the website for you, but it's worth waiting a week or two for your products."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love SheIn! I've gotten so much stuff from them, and loved it all so far. ♥️ I also love that they give you the 4 payment installment option to make it easier to pay for everything. The sizing is sometimes a little off with things. But as long as you read reviews carefully before purchasing, it's fine."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love Shein. IM a Plus girl its got every style shape look for seasons it is addictive but in a good way! My daughter introduced me she is 18 I am 48. We both order so quick and easy. The prices are amazing value. The orders do take a few weeks to arrive but you can track your order at any time to see what stage it is at. It is hard to find modern up to date clothes for the fuller figure but this company is achieving it. And it has household items as well as shoes just perfect
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've ordered quite a few times and I'm still going back for more. I love the app and all of the products. It's great quality and money well spent. If you love fashion, the even let's you compete in a fashion showdown where you create outfits and compete for likes. Browsing on Shein definitely makes my day."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It was good.. until I left my house. Both my devices were connected. One to wifi and the other to my regular data and much like ALL of the other complaints, the devices disconnected out of no where and weren't able to reconnect. Truly think they have bugs to fix before it's worth paying for"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love shopping on shein especially since it gives you points for every purchase and every review you make and these points can you be used in next purchase as discount. Also, I like that there is status of your shipment from leaving the warehouse to reaching local facilities to reaching your home. Although there have been few issues in some orders but shein customer support was supportive and issued refund accordingly. Overall, very satisfied with app and definitely would recommend it to others."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They show the product but we don't know where is the botton you can press to buy. I've searched alot, Am still searching.😴"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very easy to navigate. Unbeatable prices, value for money, but remember folks You Get What You Pay For. So factor that in. However, the feedback system is clear, accurate and genuine. One of the best I've ever used. User's post pics; the good, the bad & the in-between so as long as you check the brilliant feedback, you can feel pretty confident on what you're going to receive. HOWEVER, ignore the models who've been filtered within an inch of their lives. & CS is clearly a problem at times 💕✌"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's an okay app tho I would appreciate if you added an feature were I can pay for peoples shopping carts or gift them money
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love Shein! Omg so much choice and so many offers! The app is so easy to use. Shein has such a wide range of products that you just wouldn't expect. All products I have received have been outstanding quality.Orders are carefully packaged and delivery times are super quick. You are able to track your order every step. Highly recommended!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,All my of my items came days before they were due and everything I chose was packaged well. The quality of the material was as expected but the colors were off on one dress and one dress did not fit as expected but the other two are keepers. I will be working on sending those two back and hope that returns go as smooth. I already have a new order started with a few items in it!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You guys suck! You cancel orders & call them returns lol you canceled an entire order of mine saying it was lost in transit and refunded portion 8f my money and reshipped what you wanted to. I got none of the swimsuits I wanted and when you refunded the price they were on sale so I couldn't afford to get any others I wanted. Oh yeah you didn't refund shipping or taxes either. So thanks for nothing. I can't even get on the free trial promo yall have, guess I need to check out other stores"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I lovee this app, if raised a ticket youll receive a call within 24 hours, but I've got it in even less than 7 hours, once I got the call back in half an hour!! the quality is great, and I needed the deliver early and I received it when I wanted. But please order it at least 2-3 weeks before you need ti wear it so they will ship it. Just of the delivery would be a little fast it would be better❤️❤️ But above everything I loved it!🥀"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein! This app has some of the cutest swimsuits for reasonable, affordable prices. Very good place to shop when you don't want to spend around 40$ on a swimsuit. The only problem I have with the app is that lately there's a glitch that prevents me from seeing the sizing estimates on certain products of clothing. I'll try to see what size (S,M,L) would be best for my body measurements but the measurements won't show up. I hope this issue will be fixed soon."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Good but delivery times Do vary but 100% Recommended ******
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Shein is horrible! Bad customer service, I've been waiting on a refund since July 17th! I can't get a hold of anyone and the last time I emailed them, they received the items back on August 3rd... and still no refund! Nothing i bought fit right, either too boxy or too large for their mediums. I have a lot of friends that loves their stuff but it hasn't worked out for me. I just want my refund!!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Too much advertising disturbing my screen
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love shein alot but why when u tell us review something to receive points we don't? That isn't fair. I watched a 3 hour video and received nothing
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I was a little nervous about ordering clothes online without being able to try them on first but I really loved browsing through the app and ordering some dresses for a family photoshoot. My pieces arrived in a timely manner after a little bit of confusion with when my package was arriving as the app said it was on hold/delayed. But I am looking forward to my next purchase. Quality of clothes is good too! Very happy with my first experience!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely love shopping on shein, I get all my clothes and both girls clothes off here, had no issues with any of the items bought, always been good quality and true to size. There is always a sale or coupon available so its also a good price range thank you for a great service so far you could improve delivery time but other than that it's brilliant."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Brilliant app, absolutely love it. Really cheap and affordable for beautiful outfits that would usually be £15+, you can buy accessories like rings, glasses, bags etc. Only thing that is slightly annoying is that not many outfits show pictures of people wearing them and some stuff only has 1 size. Brilliant app though, works amazingly and smoothly and lost count of how much outfits i like on it. Brilliant app, really reccomend downloading. Probably the app I Buy most of my clothes from lol."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love Shein. Orders $49+ has free shipping Otherwise 3.99 express shipping is only 12.99 for the full order and the apparel, accessories, and other products are great. You must be patient because it normally takes 15-21 days to receive items. You get points for daily check ins, advising of package delivery, and reviews you use towards your next order and on top of that they give you coupons depending on how much you spend so you never pay full price. They also have outfit contests."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I think this is an overall good app. The only comments that I would like to leave are... 1. The clothing often times is not of good quality. That's improved. Since a lot of pieces are made strictly of cotton, the wrinkling can be awful to deal with. 2. The wait time to receive my orders so far are coming from China and that really delays the receipt of orders. This is improving as well and kudos for that. I recommend your site often."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is so user friendly. I love Shein because of the variety and prices. Is everything good quality? No. Are all the sizes right? No. But I read the reviews and look at the customer photos to help make all my decisions and have been very lucky to rarely need to return anything but when I did the process was very easy. Its great that they have reward systems and writing reviews and posting pics earns them, very smart to increase reviews! Highly recommend!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Awesome. Products are a lot cheaper than other brands but with good quality. Easy to navigate through the Shein app as well and the review/feedback that will earn you points regardless of the star you attrtibute to an item helps a lot when deciding which to purchase and in accumulating points with monetary equivalent. And I like to games too wherein you earn points or discoints. Thanks, Shein!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is fairly good and the items I've ordered are excellent compared to the prices, but some of the items need a bit more working on the quality, the materials are average but the finishing needs more improvements, I've wore one of the the items and it got torn in 10 minutes!! But in general I do recommend it 👍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love it I've found so many things on Shein that are so useful and of good quality! Once you understand the sizes and how they measure almost all of the clothes I've ordered fit properly! I like the little gadgets you can get for the office and kitchen as well. The shipping is the only thing that might deter someone from ordering takes about 2 weeks but if you have patience and live on a budget it's worth it!. I've saved so much. Thanks Shean!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have had this app for a few years now and I still LOVE IT!!! Very cool, affordable clothes, huge variety. They have just about anything you are looking for, even down to stationary, linens accessories, you name it. Shipping is fast, within 2 weeks, and free at times. The app itself is nicely laid out, easy to navigate, my only complaint is they sell out of items and don't seem to get them back in stock ever, but there's so many new styles added all the time it is hard not to find similar items"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"LOVE SHEIN! I got so many amazing bathing suits without breaking the bank buying pieces for $20 at Target - and I can still mix and match ! I've gotten great clothes for all seasons! Even the plain white t-shirt w/ the pocket is like, my new favorite top ! The quality is fantastic and the prices are amazing ! Having the clothes photographed and reviewed by *real* girls is so helpful in knowing what size to order. I've also gotten gifts for my friends & family, as well as home accessories ! A+ !"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I received my order today, all good, as usual. Later I got an email to ask me confirm parcel delivery by click on encrypted link I get several fraud emails a week that say I owe money, I'm in trouble with the goverrnment or the police + demanding that I click a link, connect with them, resolve the 'problem' I've been advised NEVER to click these links - they give criminals access to my data + I never do it. I checked the Shein app for place to confirm - none but this one?! Regards, Lynn Mangan"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very easy to navigate, post reviews and order items. I like in the mobile app you can click on the items you want to check out. I wish this feature was on the website as well because I can have a bunch of items in my cart but don't have to delete them to purchase them. I could also track my items in the app and see what accessories or other shirts to match the outfits because I could see the pictures."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shein is a overall great App. You get your orders delivered in a timely manner and 95% of the time my orders are exactly as described. There are multiple selections in all categories, sooo many items to choose from, which can become very addictive. There are opportunities for great discounts once you are familiar with App."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I made a prepaid order and my order is stuck in a place since the past few days and there is no tracking update since then. When I called up their customer service, initially they told they'll expedite the delivery, but the issue still persisted after waiting for days together. Later, when I tried to call them up, they had blocked my number. They have got such pathetic customer service and are of no use. And the issue still stands unresolved.Order KCX98831."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love Love Love Shein ❤️ I was skeptical at first, due to previous purchases from cheap, inferior online shopping companies - you don't always get what you wish for 😉- however Shein have been amazing. I almost kicked myself for waiting so long to order. Now I no longer buy clothes from anywhere else (unless I'm searching for something brand specific). Shein sizing is on point, the clothes are comfortable and their return process is a piece of cake. Highly recommend. ✋️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I was searching for swim wear, but you get extremely discouraged when it's the same unrealistic looking model in every single picture. They have like two models for all the clothes and it does not help selling stuff. Not everyone is a size zero with fake breasts 🤷‍♀️ Just my own opinion. If you wanna be able to sell to more people, keep in mind there's more than one size/ body type."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's a really awesome app.. I really like it.. I have been purchasing every month since 2018.. SHEIN have everything i need for everday look.. but the problem is that you guys don't restock the items.. I have been waiting for months but the items didn't restock.. all that aside you guys did a fantastic job making SHEIN this much awesome..
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Wish I can take this one star away order some things and all a sudden a whole week before Christmas everything is in a shamble packages are backlogged and they stuck in Hong Kong and these are gift I waiting on for almost a 2week and they act like they can't do anything to get it out this is so said just go pick up the packages and send out through another delivery company it's like they don't care then you chat with an agent and they act like they doing something and they tell you anything
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,App easy to use and I've ordered many things from here. To get a true look at items just look at real customer reviews with their images and you'll get a more realistic idea what it will look like on you. Great prices and I haven't been disappointed so far. Clothes come well protected and in great condition. Highly recommend
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app works okay, but I found it extremely annoying that every time I wanted to go back after looking at my cart from the payment screen to add my coupon, it would empty my cart. I didn't end up getting to use my coupon. I had to go back and find all 6 products, 4 different times."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Worst experience ever. I've made an order using their app, but it was cancelled from their side after 2 days; claiming that I'm not the owner of the credit card ""even though I've sent them the proofs they requested"". And they didn't even bother themselves to respond on my messages to them. Very poor service."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,As easy as it maybe to use this app and order placement. Recently I don't get why my app isn't showing the right currency nor does it recognise the country. I am being forced to shop as a visitor and then my cart is empty. I wanted to place an order since Thursday 11 Nov with no luck. I have an app that says I'm either in Belgium or Austria. Prices not the same as that on my items in ZAR which I find it odd. I just wanna place an order on the items I have put on my cart. My boards are empty.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,App is full of drug paraphernalia. Just signed up and they selling bongs and crack pipes!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"never received my packages on my first order, got a refund and uninstalled."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is a good shopping app But you can find the same thing on Amazon( it's a little more expensive on Amazon ) the pictures are never the same when you get it and most of the time the sizes are wrong you just got to check the reviews on the clothed itself. The points you get every day when you check in is awesome and the live streams they do is a great thing as well because they tell how the product works and how it fits if you want it Love shein.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Shein is great you get what you paid for and what you see is what you get. Just make sure you read through the reviews and look at the images uploaded by customers to get more information on the item you want to buy. It takes 3 to 4 weeks for the order to be delivered and an excess fee must be paid to the company making the delivery or you won't get your order. Shein is the best and cheapest online store and the Shein app makes things easier when shopping and tracking your order.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Shipping fee are very expensive, you have to buy above R740 before you get Shipping free, but here's the catch, then you pay it anyway for Custom Fee at your local post office before you can collect your SheIn parcel. Also if some item is defective or not according to size chart and you ask for refund, SheIn wants you to return the item. It is not worth it, because of expense fees of Shipping, Customs vs what the item costs. I do not recommend this app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Got my granddaughter a bikini bathensuit, too skimpy. Wanted to return, but not getting the full price I paid back. They wanna keep the shipping cost. The whole thing was $16.00 and some change. It hasn't been 45 days either. It only cost $10.00 , the shipping cost just about as much as the bathensuit. I thought if you're not satisfied you get all your money back."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Worst experience they cut my 180 sr. from my account n not refunded that ...I complained about that as much as possible but there is no response.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I decided I wanted to add to my order after going into the pay screen, by the time i cancelled my order it had taken all my stuff out of the basket and I couldnt be bothered to look for everything again. Not very user frendly. Also I added a discount code which then put what was originally a free shipping up to £4.00 very misleading. Unless items are perfect I will not be using this app or company again."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Who doesn't love Shein! Huge range of clothes, shoes, accessories and things for the home, at really competitive prices. Buyers reviews and photos give reassurance of what you're buying. Customer service is the best I've ever had. The only down side is the search options could be improved as items are often duplicated in the results multiple times"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My teenage GD recommended Shein and I've never looked back. Always loved bright clothes and this ticks all the boxes. Shoe measurements are given, and having extra-wide feet means this is a bonus for me because their shoes fit. The range of sizes is excellent and is given for every single item, meaning you can be confident that clothes will fit thus less returns. The clothes actually look like they do on the site, don't think I'll ever go back to the high street, it's too much hassle🙂"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app doesnt even deserve to get 1 star...don't purchase anything from this app...worst shopping app i have ever come across...1st they show something else on the pic and deliver something else...2nd when we return the item they don't refund the full money...they deduct a lot of money in the name of insurance, shipping price, pick up price, etc...wastage of money..worst shopping app/site.. i suggest everyone not to buy anything from this app because it will be huge wastage of money. Worst app"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've ordered a few times now and learned to navigate fairly quickly. Everything I received was exactly what was ordered and usually arrived pretty quickly ( about a week) For the price you can't beat it and have ventured outside my comfort zone due to exploring the vast amount of products suggested.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I actually really love SheIn and I wasn't really expecting to but so far a good 95% of what I have gotten has worked out! Occasionally something doesn't fit quite right but with the prices like this it's really hard to complain. Much better luck with this app than others like wish.... And it's super easy to navigate. Shopping or even just favoriting stuff is easy and fun!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great style, at great prices!!! Shein has something for everyone. Every style imaginable, for every body shape. The items are good quality too. They use nice fabric, that washes well. I recommend ordering items by the measurements given and not your US clothing size to get the best fit. Once you order from Shein you won't shop anywhere else. I LOVE Shein! It's my favorite place to shop!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have a very love/hate relationship with Shein. From the very first order, I have always ended up with clothing that is unwearable due to improper sizing. I order 5 things in my size and maybe 3 of them fit. Same for my children. Its quite annoying. If their sizing was consistent, I wouldnt have an issue. Very affordable and generally well made. Read the reviews before purchasing anything!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app like crazy, so many options & fashions!! I ❤️ how most prices are lower than the prices here, & their always giving out points & coupons! I can buy things that I can't in the stores around me. Like when I wanted to buy baggy pants w/out holes, there were none. Then I found shein, & there were 100's of cute options for me! BUT (all good things come to an end😂) some of the fabric qualities are quite cheap though they cost more than should. Tho its definitely my go too store!😁😁"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I remember my first haul. It was a couple of tank tops, crop tops, and then some blouses for work. I was sooo nervous they would end up being thin and cheaply made because it was so cheap. But NOPE! The material was thick, soft and exactly as pictured! I've been buying from them ever since! I literally only shop on this app now. I get so many compliments :)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love that the prices are so great on the items. It's not perfect, but it is good quality stuff. The shipping is not overnight, but is definitely faster than some other services I've used, and they're very good about keeping you updated on where your package is. Accurate predictions on arrival and no issues thus far. Keep up the good work."

The shipping is not overnight, but is definitely faster than some other services I've used, and they're very good about keeping you updated on where your package is. Accurate predictions on arrival and no issues thus far. Keep up the good work."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's really great prices but it's hard to tell what size it will be if it's true to size or too big or too small, also sometimes it's a hard til tell the material of the clothes but really it's worth it for the price. Updated 9/2/22 I really love the party items, balloons and stuff it's great stuff some balloons you would spend 100$ plus on for like a few dollars! If you haven't checked them out yet! You are missing out! My best tip is to always read the reviews and the measurements!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Though i like Shein, They have pretty variety of Plus Size options, but they require 10days and more and little bit expensive too. Thanks for the Variety and Quality:) Changed to 1 as they have horrible return policy,their customer care never pickup ,if they do they have arrogance,i got message of return pickup but no one came. This totally disappointing"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I was pleasantly surprised by my shopping experience. The ease of tracking and reviewing orders in real time is appreciated. Very easy to apply and obtain discounts. The measurements provided along with feedback from previous buyers are helpful in determining sizing (be sure to click on additional details to consider the amount of stretch when selecting a size). Definitely a new shopping app option for me!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Easy to navigate, shop & return items if necessary. I'm new to Shein and have been pleasantly surprised by the quality & value for money. I've placed 2 orders with varying styles so I could choose. Hence my returns, not for any other reason. I'm looking forward to feeling feminine and confident on my holidays this year - thank you 😊"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I can't get in touch with costumer service at all, too busy I guess, I have 2 orders that are delayed by a month thanks to the delivery company Imile and I'm pretty positive I'm not going to get them ever (Imile in Mx steals packages), I need a refund shein and your cs channels are not the greatest, I need resolution"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I adore Shein. It is way better than Amazon, btw, it's cheaper and better quality. I've heard enough about it to know what to expect like ""you get what you pay for"" and that works! It's cheap stuff so if it doesn't last long it isn't a big loss. And in reality I don't think I've gotten anything that was ridiculously under quality, even the jewelry for $1-3 lasts cuz I don't wear it often. The clothes are loud and I love dressing up here and there. I've been using shein for a couple years now."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Items are always like the pictures. Product information is very thorough. I love that fact that you can see real people's reviews and pictures. I can shop with confidence knowing what I'm getting and they always deliver on time. Sometimes even earlier than quoted. Returns are also easy and fast.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've had shein for a couple of years now. Really good app. Love the clothing. But I was adding items onto my list.. and everything was fine.. then suddenly everything I added to my wishlist isn't there anymore.. please fix this. I was planning on buying those items soon.. it'll take me forever to figure out what I need.. Hopefully it's just a glitch on my part. But still, please help!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Update: after a few months and and a half dozen orders later and I didn't think I could love the app and site anymore. The themed sales I so much fun and interactive and the deals are out of this world only place I have found where The average person can actually afford to keep up with new trends and all the talk styles. I've never had a problem with a order or any items. considering the low prices they exceed expectations with every order In love with SHEIN!❤️❤️
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Shein changed their daily check in bonus (points). I checked in and instead of giving me 3pts , they gave me 1 pt."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is an amazing shopping app,they have the trendiest clothing,which is my favourite part of shein.It is super affordable and sells so many fun, interesting,trendy, fashionable and exciting clothes, toys, décor, jewelry ect. Whenever I order something of of shein it comes as early as it possibly can which makes me super happy as I get to enjoy my order quicker.You most likely won't regret the download."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Where the hell is my order. It's say it's been delivered but nothing. You either send me my stuff or you refund me for everything. You only have robots replying so no point at all contacting them. Thanks anyway.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shein is wonderful. It takes some time to receive your packages but usually 3-4 weeks tops! I do wish shein carried more extra small sizes in woman's everything. I also wish they sold things like wall art, like it originally used too. Also, the delivery tracker is not accurate, it usually arrives before the delivery date which is great but then packages get stolen off your front steps because it doesn't automatically text or call ya when they're arriving."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The app works really well and they ship right away. I wish the company had a more consistent fitting and did close-up pictures of the fabrics on each ad because many clothes I had to send back due to not liking the texture and look of the material used.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"As a plus-sized girl, i'm always super skeptical about online shopping sites cause some places just don't get our sizes right. But SHEIN is NOT one of those places. Everything I've purchased has been True to Size (a little larger than expected occasionally, which I don't mind), high quality, and super cute! Really glad I found this site and will definitely keep shopping here"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The only thing I think needs to change, is I think it would be nice if the products were modeled by several women of several sizes. Like some idems come in sizes ranging from XS to an XL I think it would be nice to see the idem in all the sizes available. I'm an XS and sometimes the model who's modeling the Small has a huge chest compared to mine... So yeah I just think that would make it better. Other then that I LOVE this app"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is user friendly, easy to navigate. So pleased to find AFFORDABLE plus size clothing!!! Love their flash sales. Lots of incentives to buy, including games and collecting points. Great reviews from 'real' customers. Everything from clothing to ingenious gadgets you never knew existed! The longest I've had to wait for an order is 2 weeks, I've also had one delivered in 2 days. The only niggle I have is that I get too many notifications. But that's it. Enjoy!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is so well designed. Whenever you add something to the cart, it suggests you other items you may like. I know this is their strategy to have you buying more but it's useful for me as it makes easier shopping the same styles. Returns are quick and straightforward. Prices are good, quality can be sometimes tricky to judge but I usually look which material is the item before buying. Here I found all the things that I needed and wanted so far."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,They didn't deliver the item. When you will contact to customer service they'll reply contact your bank. Fraud. Fraud. 😡😡😡😡😡
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I tried to organize my wish list and used the selecting option available. after I attempted to delete the selected items, half of the items I DID NOT select disappeared from my wishlist (almost 100 items) and some of the stuff I DID select remained. this NEEDS fixed. I have no idea how I'm going to find all my liked items again and honestly don't even want to bother with it anymore."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely LOVE Shein! I haven't gotten one bad product or clothing from them. Alot of packages come earlier then what the date given which is a plus in my book. Never had a late package, great prices and coupons. Clothing generally true to size if not make sure to always read the reviews which are extremely helpful and will help you keep from making a mistake. Love that there are always new clothing everyday. 10/10 one of my most frequently used shopping apps."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a brilliant app their clothes are really lovely, They are packaged good and real quick delivery. The best thing about this site is you can get modern clothes in bigger sizes also different options on payments you can use ie clearpay makes it just that bit easier if you on a low Income also they very generous with money off vouchers and free delivery and they running a reward scheme to .I Highly recommend them."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have just ordered 14 items and cost was rs. 1400 and I got a rs. 200 discount. They also have all the payments options like paytm and all. I really enjoyed my shopping time. It heve been a lockdown period and didn't buy accessories. I really loved it. Hopefully I will receive my percel soon. Can't wait to receive it and open and all. Must go and check it people. Thank you.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Really good, it's one of the best and easiest apps to use. Customer service is good, I think some just don't realise how to use it, it's not that clear tbh, but there are real people there! They're helpful and always make sure they reply to messages within 24 hours. Just make sure you read other reviews to be sure to order the right size as returns are tricky. I'm in the UK and usually receive orders within a week to 10 days. I've been impressed by the quality."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"AMAZING APPP!!! I have actually never been on such an amazing cheap app. I absaloutely LOVE Shein. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because you can't use more than 1 coupon per order which I kind of get a bit upset about but overall I love it. Prices are incredibly low and clothes are perfect and come in perfect condition. I finally found an app I can trust and rely on, this is the most reliable clothing shop ever. They also sell things other than clothes for such a low price 😍😍😍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So happy to shop from Shein. I am on this app whenever I need something for myself or my family. I have bought clothes mostly and have been very satisfied with the quality. I find the reviews very helpful while choosing anything to buy. Another thing I love about ordering is you can track your order from beginning to end. My orders have always been delivered on time. You get points also for signing in every day. I like how you can narrow down search options, and find easily want you need."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love Shein! I especially love there bedding, I've had 2 duvets now and the quality is brilliant, all duvets have zips and inside little tassels that help when changing the bedding. There clothes for me is a hit or miss! Sometimes I'm lucky. I love there wall art too. There prices are amazing. Delivery use to take weeks, but it's been a little quicker over the last few months."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've really thoroughly enjoyed the app. It's easy to navigate and play around with while trying to decide what you want to purchase immediately and what you'd rather move to your wishlist... I love that there's usually several reviews with pictures. Just remember, you always have to RE-CLICK THAT SHIPPING OPTION and just use Express shipping because the Priority shipping ends up with DHL and then you're dealing with duty fees. If you leave your cart &come back, click it back off Priority again!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Normally I would leave a 5 star 🌟 rating, but ever since they've grown and added the shipping overseas. It takes longer to receive my packages. idk maybe it's just a small issue, and they will fix? Hopefully, but everything else on this app is great. I love Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've always been skeptical to order from shein but I have been pleasantly surprised. Received orders within specified time with excellent tracking of packages. Quality of clothing is good considering prices paid. Love all the accessories and extras one can buy for pets, kitchen and more!!!! The problem is trying to stay away from the app?!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"omg, I love Shein so much, I don't even know where to start this app is so good with tracking packages, it tells you every detail . Everything is so cheap I brought very good lashes from there for 2$, and they looked super cute. If your thinking about installing SheIn just do it! All the plus size clothes are so cute as well, and they have very cheap parachute pants! I love Shein!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've ordered several times with SHEIN. Almost every item that I received was very good quality. When you place an order, it usually arrive on or before the delivery date that they give you. Once I placed an order and the postal service never delivered it to my address. I contacted SHEIN and they gave me a full refund in less than 10 days. The only complaint that I have is if an item runs out of stock you can't get it later because it seems like once an item is out, they don't restock it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I LOVE this app. It's so easy to use and has so many categories of clothing/items that theres nothing more you could ask for. The prices are amazing and lower but the quality is still very good. There are reviews people have left under every item so you can see other peoples experiences with it before you buy it!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I ordered something and was tracking it daily. Then the app suddenly signed me out of my own account and I couldn't get my password right. it wasn't working. So I clicked the 'forgot password' button and it got me to go to my email and change my password. But of course it kept giving me ""couldn't change password, try again later"". If this didn't happen I would be giving it 5 stars. EDIT: after all of that, I finally got into my account and got to see that my package was finally almost there :)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely love this site, lots of good quality clothes and the knit wear is brilliant. Find the sizing a little bit hit n miss and most of the reviews don't convert to UK sizing just USA, or EU which is frustrating. Searching for a dress I have seen on one of the adverts has been a nightmare, it states New In but I've looked everywhere and can't find it, so I've given up. All considered though a great shopping site with plenty of choice and great prices. Just wish delivery didn't take so long."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have posted negative comment before but now over the time I can say a bit more. My first order wasn't the best but customer service sorted the problem. Now I have ordered many times and alway have great service. Recently contacted customer service again with regards to my refund and it was sorted straight away. I'm very happy customer and obsessed with app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is great, easy to find and look at the items and descriptions, really liked the feedbacks, it made it easier to decide whether you want to choose it or not, but the comments. I had a little problem going back to a page sometimes. But other than that it was great. Thankyou"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's very good and nice paa their delivery is fast
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Very much love Shein products... But recently i order on flash sale upon check out and payment thru gcash the item did not arrival due to no stock available and until now no update for my refund 😔
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,They have great clothes and great items but I have been waiting over a month to get some of my stuff and it still says it's in transit.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So easy to use the app, clear, fantastic items for sale. Easy returns if you do not want what you buy after trying it on. I love Shien! Especially their flash sale where great items start from 2.99, great value! I have made many purchases and will continue to do so. The products are generally really good quality, my only returns have been styles I dont like when I try them on."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I don't think I've seen a clothes store with better prices. I mean where else can you find good quality neckpaces for $1.50 and matching outfits for less than $10? Puts Old Navy to shame. They didn't arrive FAST per say, but they did come sooner than expected. Still wish they arrived sooner though. Great quality and super comfortable. One thing did break the first day but eh it happens. Also love the coupons."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,So far it has been an easy app to navigate. The prices shown are good. It's easy to get purchases entered and the sections for ordering and payment are easy to use ... No entering the same information three times before your order can go through like some apps I no longer use!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Ladies..you love city chic and simillar stores,this is the app for you. Simillar styles for a fraction of the price. But the best thing is there's guys stuff, kids stuff, pet stuff and things for your home....all in 1 app. It's very affordable, offers afterpay as an option and gives regular vouchers to use as discounts on orders. Also the review system gives points to cash in for savings....winning all around!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I placed a first time order and I was hesitant because the clothing prices were very cheap so my thought was the clothing would be as well. WRONG ! The items I ordered were of excellent quality and sizes were on point and every item comes in a cute resealable bag. Shipping was fast and I look forward to placing another order. Thanks Shein
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I've had to cancel over 6 orders because my card is not being accepted. All troubleshooting steps were done and still nothing. I was told the issue would be escalated and it's now day 3 and no updates on same. It makes no sense sending the order through if the payment is being rejected. I'll update the rating if I ever get to order.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Its a good app if u r looking for inexpensive but stylish clothes. They got something for everyone, got kids clothes, plus size clothes. It give u coupons from time to time for certain percent off with minimum purchases given. But i didnt like its order tracking as i feel it dont tell exact real location of your order."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,this has to be the most organized and easy to use shopping app. there are so many different filtering options that you can also use to navigate your (gigantic) wishlist! they constantly offer coupons and incentivize writing reviews with points so you can snag some pretty crazy deals. it makes shopping fun!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I love most of the clothing it doesn't always hold up but usually if it falls apart within a short about a time I can get a refund. I love the clothes and it's up to date and style though I wish not everything was a crop top LOL I am frustratedbecause I've tried to do the manual service and it won't really work half the time and it just wants me to submit a ticket that's why I've rated It low
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app not only are the clothes great quality at a very affordable prices but you get coupon codes and you get points when you check in on the app so you can get even more money off your orders, but you can also win prizes! For example I won a competition so I got an order of clothes for free! I recommend this app to eveyone"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Loving Shein. Got some of the best stuff for low peices. While you have to read the reviews on the items it is still a great place to shop. I have never waited to long for orders and most of the time they arrive before the scheduled date. They also have really good tracking all in one place so i don't have to open up another tab just to track my package!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I've been buying products from Shein for 1yr now and I haven't had any problems with this website. Their clothes are nice the quality is good. and the price point is excellent. No issues with the delivery. It is exactly as stated and you also earn points while shopping which I always use when buying products. Once you get familiar with sizing everything should be fine. As long as you have a good eye for style you will have no problem shopping on this site. even my teenage daughter love Shein.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love Shein, you have to wait a wee while to get your order, but it's worth it. I order all the time. I used to worry about sending stuff back if it didn't fit, but it's really easy and free to do. Delivery is free if you order over £35 worth, which is easy to do as the designs are so unusual. The jewellery is fab, as is some of the home interior items, tablecloths and napkin rings,etc. The quality is comparable to primark, but I have got some very high-quality items from shein for great prices."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I placed a order in April and haven't received my order. I recieved an email that my order would be delayed. However, the app tells me my order has been delivered. the tracking number that was given states label was created back in may and nothing more. The guest service feature really isn't a big help. The app is requesting me to review my purchase. How if I never received it"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Ive ordered some Shein clothing, the basics are great, and ive found some good kids clothes. However, what i do not like about this app is the very sexually suggestive style of photography on much of the womens clothes. I would not recommend the app to others because many ads look like soft porn. I also wont let my kids look through it with me."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Quite surprised with the quality, you definitely get what you pay for. I've seen some really nice clothes and styles on here, if only they were a bit more curvy girl friendly. I feel like the curvy range isn't as nice as the range for the smaller built. But I'm happy with what I've purchased."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Clothes bought from here is actually good. But an unexpected thing happened to me. By mistake, i returned a dress bought from some other app while i was about to return a top bought from this app, neither shein clarified it nor notified me about my mistake but i found it displayed (which was mistakenly returned by me) with shein tag and that dress was available for sale after some days of return. That dress was not displayed in the clothes section previously. Lacked gd service andresponsibility"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So far so good, really good quality and at cheap reasonable prices. Great for people who can't afford much in life, love that you get free discounts and free day shipping once in awhile. You also get to apply for free discounts. The only downside I have is the delivery it takes forever, and as for the items once it's gone it's gone, so I would only look for clothes when you know you have the money, saves the disappointment. Lol"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've got a few things and I liked them but what's going on with this whole £750 promotion? I was skeptical about it but I saw all the ads and thought why not; this this has had me set up and build village on a coin master account and set up a clear score account even though I don't want either of those things and it still hasn't given me the promised shopping money, it just keeps saying I need to download more apps I don't want. Am I doing it wrong? Is it a glitch in the system? What's going on?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I always have good experience with Shein, I love ordering from here. Everything I've ordered so far, is pretty good- prices, materials/fabrics, the fit, quality & for the price, totally not bad, maybe here & there ypu might get something that feels like a semi cheap material, but hey for things under $10, can't really complain right lol"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Easy to navigate but searching things is kinda difficult as it goes by buzzwords, not what the item actually is. Super cheap though and you can find really good stuff for >£10, just be sure to read reviews as the materials aren't always the best and you can't return the majority of items."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is good and easy to use. When you order from the SHEIN website, you will receive your order within two weeks."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Whenever I get to spin the wheel or get a present from the live it always goes to ""Thanks for Playing"". Initially when I installed I didn't have that issue but now it happens all the time. Since I noticed that I just stopped trying all together. If you're going to promote features atleast give the users a chance to earn."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall experience is good, returns and refunds no problem..occasionally the quality of products is is terrible but that's really only on the cheaper items. Sizing is good if you are bigger it does usually appear alright although sometimes it might be a little bigger for me. But overall experience is good, never had a problem with returning or refunding. Thank you Shein"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent, Awesome and Authentic Application..!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"SHEIN is really amazing. I really love all of the product that I have already purchased. Since I downloaded this app I never try other shopping apps. Though at first I'm a little afraid that there product might a little bit bigger for me, since my first purchased arrived it amazed me they are true to size and they have also size suggestion which is also very accurate for me. The product arrived so fast and you can track them. This is only my experience since I used this app. MORE POWER SHEIN❤️.."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Shein is not good anymore, there's no more free shipping at every sat-sun and the 70% discount on points is just 30% now and it makes you feel that you don't wanna shop there anymore. I really hate shein now"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Items are all good sized and individually packaged. Clear instructions fir returns and refunds too. Quality and finish in the items I have personally bought are very good. This app itself has been easy to navigate and easy to see pictures if items, zoom function works well too."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,To be honest i loved this app..it has one of the best collection of clothing n accessories. But after having issues with two of my orders I'm bound to rate it to 1 star. My two orders were automatically cancelled stating in customers request. However i have never made such request. Moreover after i faced this problem from my first account i tried to order something with my second account . But then too same issue occured. I want my package to be delivered to me. Kindly look into this matter. This is my favourite online store I don't wanna lose my package...please help.. THANKING YOU IN ANTICIPATION
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"My personal experience was great. I only ordered 4 items, they were scheduled to arrive a month later ,however, they came 2 weeks later. I personally know people still waiting on larger orders over a month now. Id love if this app had express shipping options as the money I saved I would have spent to recieve items much sooner and so would had the people I know with much bigger orders still waiting. They may get their stuff when the season is close to being over..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is the best app ever! Runs smoothly in my experience and very easy and intuitive to navigate. If you're a curvy lady and usually struggle with finding cut outfits that are fitting, search no more. Shein will overwhelm you with unbelievably beautiful choices. I've been going crazy with shopping cos there are a lot of beautiful things on here."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"What I have ordered has been great. BUT the very big fact of the matter is they keep advertising things that are sold out. It has happened several times now. An ad will pop up and the item is unavailable in EVERY size. Can't even purchase it and do alterations, very annoying."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely horrible, me and my sister have been shopping with shein for a while now and they always ship our order out to the wrong place"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's no exaggeration when I say that more than 80% of my closet is from SHEIN. I love the daily sales and the ease at which I can shop for/purchase/return items. Overall I think the site has pretty decent quality items for a reasonable price. I am REALISTIC when it comes to this app tho. Sometimes the products I get are duds, or just not that great but honestly, that happens with a lot of retail apps. Love this shopping app!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I placed my order for nearly 3 weeks now, which was mentioned as EXPRESS SHIPPING, New Year came and went by, but still didn't received it. Very disappointed. Daily i get messages nonstop, READY FOR DELIVERY, SHARE YOUR LOCATION, AND ITS NEVER DELIVERED. Most ratings feel like has beed hired help, i feel. Never ever I wiĺl place any order nor will recommend to anyone to shop from this app. My Amazon order was delivered in 3 days and things were perfect as described. SHEIN is *BAD*"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My experience with SHEIN has been so Fun and Excited. The organization of the different categories made it so easy to navigate the app.I love the fact that SHEIN caters for women of all different sizes. I also love the free points we're able to receive for just even logging on the app etc.A Easy way to sum up my overall experience with SHEIN is being able to go into a whole different world of Fashionable,Quality and Affordable Clothing 🥰💯"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Sooo much better than an app like Wish.. My first order came earlier than expected and out of 10 items, only 1 didn't fit and 1 was just not working in the blouse area. I was completely shocked at the quality of the clothing. They have not only clothes for everyone, but just about anything you could imagine. Their points system is amazing; you can receive points for reviewing your items, people Liking your review, playing a mini Stylist Game and more.. You can literally become a model for Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app layout, very easy to navigate and brilliant bargains. Good selection of products to choose from. Also there are plenty of discount codes to use as well as their points system which can be used for money off of purchases. All in all I really enjoyed browsing and purchasing from this company via the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Once you understand how to shop with these kinds of places, you'll understand how essential they will end up being for you in the long run! I've been doing business overseas for many years now and have understood everything involved with international shopping and shipping. It is worth it, this place for example is surprisingly good quality for very affordable prices! I've personally never had to wait more than a week for things to arrive, however I will pay the price for the quick shipping!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Such scam!!! I placed my first order and made my payment through paytm! Money was deducted from my bank...but in the app it was showing ... pending payment! I tried to contact the customer service...they were so reluctant...!! They are just asking me to contact bank and not taking the blame or working on it! I'm highly disappointed!! My money is gone! None of them are helping me! I have showed them the screenshots of my payment...but they are not at all helpful! Very disappointed!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Best Product Quality❤️ I have placed several orders with SheIn and every time I received my shipments within a reasonable time frame. For the most part there clothing is decent and sometimes fantastic quality. Especially for the low price tag. I have only ever received 1 item where the quality was not so great. To tell you the truth I would purchase from SheIn before I ever would Fashion Nova again. Shein's quality is better and half the price. They also always give coupons and issue points.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Ran across this site while scrolling and it's pretty cool so far. Lots of cute clothes for the fam. The only negative so far is that a bunch of the women's clothes have the shorter tops and I want longer. The prices are really good and the clothes I bought for Christmas are excellent. Great order to arrival time also. Definitely recommend this site to all
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I like the app haven't had any issues with it. But the tracking for the shipping hasn't updated for like a week and all they told me was it was most likely still in customs. But IDK if that really is the case. My order shipped the 28th and hasn't updated since the 3rd so I'm a little worried I will not get my order. I've never ordered from this site and would really not like to start off on a bad note.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Some functions made me confused. Perhaps it is my bad, but it would be nicer if the developer can make it easier. For example, the confirmed receipt address button, I thought it is for confirming my address, so I hit it. But it turned out to be a confirmed delivery option which I have not yet received. So now I am worried if I will get my order or not. Update (4 Nov 22), I am ok with the app now. I wish they have more choices for me to shop!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is really interesting and good I love this app because it has the best seller and not expensive things ❤
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I love shein but why are the prices so expensive like everything wasn't that expensive before
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"haven't used the app to pay for my items yet since I shop online but I do use the app to look at items, and check out other features they offer when not looking online. I already ordered couple of times and kept everything, for inexpensive trendy clothes and accessories so far it's all very nice. shipping was timely but I qualified for Express service so expected my packages in a reasonable timeframe. items are nicely packed as well."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Worst app ever packages never come on time and I hate that they always give u the worst coupons ever like don't download this app real shops are better.

I can spend less than what I usually purchase in stores, though don't get me wrong I love shopping in stores too, but Shein is better with affordable prices. Their clothes are cute, but there are some that I dislike however it doesn't prevent me from using the app. From the app to purchasing clothes and accessories to shipping, I have no problem with."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Well I received my first order of 3 bodycon skirts. Awesome accurate fit. So many compliments. I am quite impressed the descriptions are so detailed and true to size. I check in daily for new and wishlist items to purchase. Prices are amazingly reasonable for the great quality of materials. Thanx! Update 4/24/2020: the customer service is trash. Its automated and didnt give me answer to my question. No live person. Otherwise meh

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"App is okay, it should be more easier to find things...customer on app is a 0. I had an issue with a return a month and a half ago and I literally kept getting connected to a new rep every time i would type out my whole situation. Very stupid and annoying to have to type everything out again because there was no option for me to copy and paste. Anyways they sent me the wrong item and kept making me feel like it was my fault. When in reality their description and picture did not match what I got."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"this app sucks. I was using a visa gift card for $25 to buy a couple items and this stupid app automatically switched my payment to my PayPal account and then charged it before I could switch it back. then when I canceled my order they refunded my money but did not refund my points or the coupon I had used. when I tried to use the Visa card again though, even when I had the total order less than the amount on the card, told me it was more than the card limit and wouldn't accept it. what a scam."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,My package is supposed to be delivered the 12 and it's the 12 but on the app it says it's in pre shipment I'm so confused?
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Easy to use app, great service, true to size fitting and great understanding of ladies shapes being curvier. Some lovely finds and more affordable than other sites. Quality has been good with the items I've purchased, would definitely recommend especially to people on a budget, there is something for everyone. 🥰"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I really wish there sizes ran bigger than a 22 plus. I would spend more with them than Amazon. As they get a lot of their products overseas the cut of the clothes runs small and I can't chance getting it exact and it not fitting. And the app gets hung up in use and the sizing is more for Euro sizing than US.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Easy to install and use the shein app.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've ordered about 15 seperate orders with multiple things in each order. The quality is brilliant and the choice amazing. The delivery to Ireland take about two weeks. Three at Christmas after black Friday. The packages are tracked on the site. I've never had any issues with sizing or quality. The reviews are really helpful and the site easy to manage and the price is low
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,They use Evri and they have left my parcel in an unsecure place. Will never order from Shein again unless I hear they no longer use Evri.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have received a defective product and I requested for return. Then they say return option is not provided for this item. I contacted customer service,had sent the image of the defective product twice, both the times the representative said knowingly it's gold whereas it was of silver. This is highly unacceptable and disappointing. Selling defective item in the name of flash sale. I have already provided the picture twice... But your representative says it's not the original product."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Okay, I need size 11 dress shoes. You don't have any. Or some flat shoes to wear. Help me get some shoes in my size."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The shopping experience is excellent, also you get everything from one store without having to visit different 'stores' which is convenient. However, I don't like the fact that stock always runs out and sometimes you never get the items again especially hair accessories"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"What I really love and appreciate (and I think what the asset is) is this site's detail when it comes to measurements and size assistance. Absolutely helpful and dependable. Even the models wearing the clothes have their measurements posted. It lessens the anxiety of thinking maybe you chose the wrong size. In terms of products, this site has a lot to improve on. The one standout absence I noticed, especially considering fashion, is the meager choices of WRISTWATCHES."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Nice app but I ordered extensions in brown and I got black ones I am really sad about that but the rest of the stuff is really good and good quality 👌
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app and have made multiple purchase hauls, but it's getting extremely annoying to go into the reviews and see that everyone is just reviewing things just for points and not putting any sort of helpful information. Also, getting into contact with their customer service via fb has been unhelpful and didn't even answer my question."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The clothes are cute and cheap but the quality can be really cheap too.For example I bought a jacket thinking it had a shearling lining and it was actually just one layer of thin fabric, so pretty useless as a jacket. But I bought another item for my daughter as part of a costume and it was perfect for that, but again probably not super functional. If you just want something cute it's fine but if you want quality items I'd just spend more elsewhere."

I find their mobile app quite user friendly and easy to navigate, unlike a lot of other online shopping platforms, and all the products I've received from them have been really good quality. Their shipping is fast and easy to track, which always puts my mind at ease. 😊 I LOVE SHEIN!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,They use child images in theirs ads
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I havent orderd anything off it yet but all the reviews seem to be good and most have pictures explaining what it truly looks like on different people and body types. Theres clothes for both men and woman and all cheep prices. Its well orginized and easy to save clothes on a wishlist instead of a shopping cart so you dont have to remove any items to buy what you want at the time. so far, I love it. (cute clothes as well!)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"There clothes are cheap with relatively good quality sometime the pieces don't look exactly like the picture but it is VERY similar! A lot of times they are same as picture, I also like that shein doesn't just show clothes on models they let customers upload photos of them with the outfits on as well so you know how it actually fits on someone just like you, love that"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Prompt delivery to Italy. Everything packed in stylish ziploc bags - but they soon start to accumulate! Realistic prices, but quality generally good overall, but nevertheless variable. App is easy to use, but it could be improved by allowing reviews to be edited at a later time."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been buying clothes for like 1 year. Every time the clothes were made of a weird material and from 10 products you keep only 2 because of wrong size, material, weird fit, etc. But one day I ordered again like 4 products and never came to me. I talked to them (which is difficult cause they don't have an easy customer service) and said they had to pay me 1. overdue payments from other orders. 2. The package didn't come. Now its October and still discussing. They won't pay. Don't buy anything."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Never received a very large order and trying to cancel or return is a nightmare. I think it might be a scam. I don't know if I'll receive my order or a refund. I'm never ordering from here again and it's disappointing because I've twice before with no issues both orders a week early. This is so disappointing because this order was a bunch of Christmas gifts for loved ones.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The worst shopping experience possible Their ""fraud prevention department"" is always canceling my orders after paid, besides it TAKES FOREVER TO RECEIVE A REFUND and sometimes canceling without any given reason. Whenever they ask for information, they want a picture of your credit card and license, in what world is that action SAFE for a client to send sensitive information like that, since sending a screenshot of the transaction from your credit card account isn't ""enough evidence"" for them"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! They have a huge variety of clothing and all kinds of stuff! Great site for us modest girls! If it weren't for SheIn, my wardrobe would not be full!! Girls, you have to try this place! The app is awesome! You can ❤️ items and also make a board! Have multiple things in your cart and pay for only what you want. So convenient. Multiple ways to pay. I just love shein! I may sounds like I'm a spokesperson but I am not. I just love this place."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I can't get enough, the clothes are true to size (which is very rare). There is a lot of great opportunities customers can earn points, which is money off your clothes, plus you don't need to purchase anything to build up your points. The clothes are a good quality, with a wide range of sizes. This is a really good app, with real people leaving comments good & bad. The level of customer interaction is fantastic. Be warned it's very addicting."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm a fairly new customer of SHEIN but I have to say I'm really enjoying the experience so far! A great variety and range of products, enough to keep even some very picky teens happy, very fair prices and lots of promo codes, and a easy to navigate site and app which presents all relevant information clearly and without confusion have made for a great shopping experience. 5/5 stars!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The Shein app is very easy to navigate and checkout is simple as well. I like the option to add items to a wishlist and if you read the product information, size guides and reviews, you will know exactly what you're getting. To date I've been pleased with the generally swift shipping."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Most of their items are great quality especially for the price, however there have been a few items with poor quality or the sizing was off. My experience regarding logistics is alway great(comes before or on time). Overall I really enjoy shopping with them."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Dangerous app, esp during covid when retail therapy is the best therapy. Spent way too much with their deals. Great for kids clothes. Women's clothing is hit or miss so I just some majority on kids stuff. Free shipping and returns are a huge plus! App is easy to use. The ads at every login is a little annoying but whatever."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"You have to love the prices!!! Shipping does take a good couple of weeks or more, so plan accordingly. And always, always reference your size guide on your item's. It's very important as many of these garments are imported (meaning they are good quality, lower price), but probably go by a different size scale than you're use to. Otherwise, Happy Shopping!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great app. Easy to use. So many different things to shop for. Shein has something for everyone. Women's clothes are true to size probably 8/10. Quality is decent to great. Big variety to choose from. Easy to earn points toward discounted or free products. Was skeptical at first but now my main go to for clothing.....both for play or work. Try it. You won't be disappointed.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I really love Shein. I am a 2x to 3x and there is so much fashionable options for me here than at a local department store (which is usally 3 x the cost and shrinks when washed but not from shein) my only suggestion would be that when selecting a size for some items maybe doing a top size and bottom size example for the out fit catagory some outffits that are sold seperate might only have the bottom piece and not the it would be the opposite. But I still love the fact that I can be a fashionable
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have ordered the first time on shein and i was a bit worried but i dont regret buying stuff . The clothes is so modern and fashionable and Not expensive at all . The sizes are Correct . You should look at the reviews before purchasing something to make sure its good . There is alot of sales and deals and it gives u great deals . My clothes took 2 weeks to ship . But it whas worth the wait . Everyone compliments my outfits and i feel great . get this app!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love browsing the Shein app! Not only is it incredibly user friendly, its is smooth and seamless and offers an abundance of ways to discover new clothing drops, trending styles, top rated and most liked items, flash sales.... this ap has it all. I cannot review the app without mentioning Shein makes points available without even having made a purchase yet, and each point is worth 1 cent or a Penny. Just for logging on and ""checking in"" each day you earn anywhere from 1 to 10/15"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very cheap prices and good quality. The only thing is that whenever you ask for more than x number of pieces, they take a few days to prepare your order and actually pack it. So if you want your clothes to arrive before a party or something, you have to submit your order with at least two weeks in advance, even if you chose Express shipping."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"App is easy to navigate, love the fact that the wishlist doesn't have a cap (well I haven't maxd it out,lol) and you can filter in your wishlist. Your order information is updated quickly and you can track your packages until they arrive. A plus size girl and its so refreshing to find clothing that look good and fit well too."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Two words ""most reliable"". I have ordered multiple times and not one item has been a disappointment. I honestly cannot wait to order every time knowing I don't have to worry. An online shopping store I can finally trust... Every single item has been delivered, a lot sooner than expected delivery dates. I could go on about Shein all day, almost all my shopping is online with Shein. I don't go to shops anymore, simply no need... So grateful!"

Decent quality, mainly get your money's worth with an occasional bad item if you don't check well enough in the reviews. Such cute stuff, cheap prices, and free first return so it's easy if you get the wrong size to get a size up or down."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Haven't had no issues with my orders. Except for the shipping delay. Which is due to the virus. But before that, I received my clothes in about a week after it ships and it usually takes 2 days before shipping out my order. But I overall love the quality and price for there clothes. I shop there all the time. I definitely reccomend."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best clothes buying app I've used. Functionality is superb. Wishlist remains even for out of stock items allowing you to revisit. Out of stock item details remain in purchased items listing which is really useful- other sites out of stock item details disappear. You can leave items in your basket and select only the items you want to purchase at that time. App is quick, loads of good vouchers and great flash sales."

However, my 1st order has not arrived and I am having difficulties in trying to trace them. There is little help offered to retrieve it, or have a replacement made. Christmas stuff, so really disappointed on that level."

Quality on every piece so far has been better than expected for the price. Shipping does take longer than items located in the US, but you can still track your order and items arrive on time and in wonderful condition. I seriously recommend this site and their easy to use app to anyone looking for a bargain deal on clothing!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very good experience. Excellent items and the of all superb prices. My experience with them is a great one. No complains. Very please with the item I had bought. Very good prices. They have everything on this app. I never have bad experience when I buy and what I love the most that they give you points that you can deduct from the cost.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love shein the quality of the clothes is amazing I haven't bought one item that I'm unhappy with, the delivery service is 'A one' always deliver before the due date which I found extremely good. for me I don't see how they could make things any better this is by far the best shopping app by far, the clothes are original and very different your not likely to see the same item anywhere or on anyone which I love. I'd recommend this shopping app for sure the 5 stars are well deserved."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,i always have a good or best experienced with shein.from their package to their sizes and the cloth they use i can tell that its excellent. the sizes are accurate.the delivery is on time. the one that enticed me most is the price which is the most important to me.price is not that high.its very affordable. styles are modern.and u can find so many things in shein namely from toothpick to battleship as they say.over all rating for me is Excellent.highly recommended.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"They have the easiest way to buy clothes online! Affordable clothes in unique styles. Easy to find what I want and it ships quickly. I earn points to get future discounts. If I want to try a new look, it's cheaper to get it from this app. Safe transactions through PayPal. I rather buy clothes online here 1st. They actually tell you if the material is stretchy and by how much"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The prices are very reasonable as well as the quality of the items. I've enjoyed shopping with shein. I love how they show several pictures of the item along with many reviews. I'm definitely gonna keep shopping with them. Plus both my orders so far came way before they were scheduled too, I really like that alot!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Less that great. Multiple times my package hasn't showed up. And it's a fight to get a refund. No thanks. Edit: (adding to original) And they respond with the same comment as in the app. If you have issues, contact customer support in app. I literally had to argue them over a big order. Their service stinks and they aren't friendly"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I ordered products for 2k with express shipping for my travel today. They changed the status to shipped. But I didn't get my products yet. Why such misleading status. No proper response on that customer service chat. I will never recommend to anyone. If anyone having plans to order anything in this sites too, I will share my experience and will not let others to suffer because of the worst service. displaying the variety of products only will not make a site or app good. They have to give a good service and customer experience. Useless app"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have been ordering from this app for over a year now. I am extremely happy with everything. I did have an order that had a few pieces that I didn't like, but I was able to return with no problems and was given q choice to receive credit or refund. I just placed a order for fall clothes for my granddaughter. I highly recommend this sight the prices are good and quality is good. 👍👍👍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very Bad experience. I placed an order and it took so much time to confirm, the processing was too long So I cancelled the order and thought that I would place it again. I made card payment but till now I didnt got any refund and the customer support services are also not very good. @Shein please look into the matter So that we would love to buy from you again"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have totally falling in love with Shein! I got 4 beautiful dresses, a pair of leggings & few other things and they fit perfectly. I'm so happy and will definitely buy from them again. The delivery process was pretty quick and came ahead of schedule. It's been a over year now still buying from Shein my only problem so far has been the length of some of the skirts and dresses which I've had to hem a few inches."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. Always ALWAYS measure yourself and read the reviews!! Never go by just the picture on the model. The material is mostly thin and cheaper, but that's excatly why your getting a tshirt or dress for £8. There is ALWAYS a code floating about so NEVER put in an order without a code. Google it or look on facebook groups for codes. Shipping times are also much quicker than stated, on average it takes a week, no longer than two. If you know what your doing, you'll really enjoy this app"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love SHEIN. Best priced Plus Size selection by far. If you need to make your money stretch and still want to be fashionable I recommend you take a look. Easy returns and exchanges, fast shipping times. Always deals and coupons available. Could not be happier."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Since i started buying from Shein all my orders have been accurate I haven't hed a problem so far. The quality of the clothes is good and there are no surprises when it comes to charging. What i like the most is that they have sizes for all body types. You can count on them to dress you for any occasion they have different designs to meet your style. The only thing that is a proble is the shipping time if they can improve that then i will be more than happy
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein, i don't like that it's so tempting to get everything lol. The parices are great and the quality of the clothes is surprisingly really good too. It's quick. It's easy and true to size. Side note, take your measurements in inches and just have it in your notes or text it to yourself it makes shopping a breeze."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The clothes are pretty cheap quality which is to be expected, but the sizing is soo inaccurate. I recieved a bag of 4 different bathing suits that I ordered all in the same size, most of the tops were way too small and the bottoms were way too big. In the end none of the 4 bathing suits is wearable and I will probably just donate them all to a thrift store."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is user friendly and the site has a lot of coupons and ways in which you can earn points. The downside to it tho is that they offer the same clothes repeatedly when the item is out of stock it will no longer be on the site. Also, majority of the times the orders are split so when it reaches customs you have to pay for them separately."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is great! It's easy to use and it's very easy to find your sizes in Shein. Other than going to a plus size store and not being able to find your sizes. Shein's clothing range varies with whatever you want to by. And it even has cheap prices too!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,All good. Nothing wrong with the app. Also Fast shipping and items as described.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"New favorite online clothing store! I've known about Shein for a while now but was always scared to order anything because of sizing problems, but after watching a million videos about their plus size fitting, I finally ordered some clothes, bags, and shoes. I love how comfortable their clothing is and nearly everything I have purchase was the perfect size."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Like different styles and unusual tops ,love them ,quality could be better, some are cheaper and some tops are over priced for me,,I have had some very elegant and classy clothes,that are not found on the high street, generally great service, speedy delivery, easy to shop at home i am finding that shein is not catering for the elder people, in sizes and don't like tacky bodycons . Shein is getting old fashioned and getting expensive. Not liking shein as much.Now they are not doing free shipping"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The only app I ship on. No hidden costs, amazing deals, great quality, great selection. I've always got it before the due date. Love this site and highly recommend it. Still using the app, the close are amazing and really good prices for great quality. Lately I've been buying the makeup 💄 as well. Great price and very good. The price was low so I wasn't expecting much but very pleasantly surprised. It's really good. You have to at least give it a look, I'm hooked."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"My experience so far as a fist time user of shein so has been great. I love that they have a size chart that helps you determine your size, and with my first order, surprisingly, everything fit.. I dont really like shopping for clothes on line just because the sizes can be a hit or miss, but with SHEIN I was pleasantly pleased and also super impressed with the quality of the clothes. Not to mention the payment choices. AWSOME! WILL DEFINATLY BE ORDERING AGAIN."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Too many awesome things to list but i love their clothes and the vareity of other items you can buy. The descriptions and details of the items along with the reviews help tremendously with purchasing. Also love the coupons, in addition to their already amazing prices, it really helps to make purchases more affordable."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really love to shop on this app. All of the items I have bought where exactly as the pictures. But the most important thing is the shipping. It's free and it ships incredible fast. For a whole order to Canada it took less than a week to receive all the items. Beside the negative comments on the net, I think that Shein is the best seller for clothing in general ✨️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The clothes are ok but some material is cheap. Lately my shopping with shein is on point I have been ordering a lot of dresses and skirts and the material is better than I expected. I love the points and coupons that are offered. If u spend $50.00 you can get 6 items/skirts and a couple of tops, all for just $40.00. with the help of the coupons. Trust me invest in shein especially if you are a plus size woman like myself. Purchase Today, you won't regret it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Shein is a terrible site. Yes its cheap, but most of the clothes get holes or wrips in them after 1 wear. Most of the clothes look good on the model but when you get the shirt in person, the colour and size is completely different. Sure spend 250 dollars for 30 things. Great deal until you wnd up throwing away 3 quarter of the clothes because they dont fit right. Not to mention it takes a month often times to get the clothes, all this waiting to find out the clothes dont work."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This sight is awesome!! All the products i have bought have been good quality and the packaging is great. Also the products were received before expected. The page is easy to understand and it has lots of information on it to get certain styles. And contest and flash sales are great.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I am new to this site so far so good. I just placed my second order with them waiting for it to arrive next week! Try it out and see if you like their selection. My first order was PJ's and I really love them! Being a plus size woman it is hard to find comfortable clothing that flatters your curves. I was also able to size down. it was an accident as the sizing gives you measurements instead of a solid numerical number. I found later on the home page 3/4 of the way down you can shop by size.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Items are all cheaply made for mass production, items I have ordered have holes in the sleeves or collars from missing stiches. Super thin material, exchanges ARE NOT FREE, they will charge you $7 per item that you send back, after you pay to have it shipped back to them. A real person is never available to contact for assistance with returns or exchanges. Very shady site and app that I'm sure is profiting majoring on false advertising."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Accessories are cheap for sure and break within a day, but I think the clothes are a pretty good deal on some. Since we can't try the clothes on and don't know what the material is like etc, they should absolutely offer free returns like Amazon or even try b4 u buy. I'm hesitant to purchase more clothes bc I used my free return and will be forced to pay $7 if something doesn't fit me or isn't as described....that's shady. Change this feature and it would be 5 stars!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The best shopping App ever! 🛍 Never had any bad experience with it. The Shein clothing is very affordable and good value for money, their quality is also great and good for the price. Always enjoy their flash sale and daily drop off, ever since I discovered and buying from the app, never had any bad experience with it and it provides me with the peace of mind and good feeling of even buying more. Their notifications and a reminder of stuff you put away whenever they're on sale is absolutely 💯"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"As a computer idiot, when I figured everything out, it was great and fairly easy. The only complaint I have, is not enough mony for more items. I wear the nightgowns every night. I use the desk items on my night table. I can find my stuff now! Your prices are right up front, no playing games like some. I will be back. I already started a list. I ALWAYS get exatly what I order."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is amazing and easy to navigate, the prices are unbelievable for the quality of the merchandise and this is my go to app when I think about purchasing online. I love SHEIN! My first purchase was a men's black lace long sleeve Tee..my husband loves it! The design in the fabric is amazing! It's seethru and it has unbelievable stretch. I highly recommend SHEIN Fashion"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Horrible clothes quality. I bought 7 dresses, only one was good quality (yes, I read the reviews, they all seemed pretty good) when they came in they looked Horrible nothing like the pictures. I decided to return 6 if the dresses, got the shipping label and instructions sent of my returns and sent confirmation on the app with proof of receipt and shipping number....ITS BEEN OVER 2 MONTH still haven't gotten my $120 back. Says the return has been received, but I never got my refund 😤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I started off with 1 item and was very happy with it. It was exactly like the picture and how I thought it would look so since then have ordered more the first one took awhile to arrive but all orders since then have arrived really quickly. I would recommend you to any of my friends excellent job keep it up
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The order no is XXH101524. There is no option to change the return pickup address . I ordered for my friend and later when we tried to return the pickup was not available from her place and there was no option to change the pickup address . The customer care insisted us to self send which causes a lot of inconvenience . It's strange that you don't have return pickup to where you deliver. So it's misguiding that you claim to have return pickup available.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They changes the prices when I checkout I took a screenshot but I can't upload it, that's ridiculous."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Do not buy items listed as ""Only 1 left"" as you would usually get an item closely resembling the order but not the item itself. Other than that, i give it 4 stars due to the style and chicness that an outfit gives. I also wish they would stop increasing prices as some items would cost higher but the design is the same as another item only the color of the cloth changed or length and it would cost 3 to 5 rials higher."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love ordering from Shein! You can't beat these prices. I've ordered 3 different times so far with at least 10 plus products each time. Everything is always packaged great and the material or products are always are in perfect conditions. Well worth it and you won't be disappointed! We will continue to order a lot from this company!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have to say the sizing is much improved. Love that you can see reviews and photis of real people wearing the products. Of course the price is amazing. Homewear stuff brilliant. You end up buying stuff you never knew you needed at fantastic value. Easy returns with no hassle. Delivery can take a while so order early 😊
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Shein has popped up with lovely items in my ads for a long time but I was wary of ordering as I didn't personally know anyone who had; to trust their accuracy or service. I decided to give them a try after finally finding someone who had good things to say & I'm so impressed. I've struggled to find a store that I can rely on to consitantly have things I like / will suit me but I've ordered A LOT from Shein with great results. Customer service & price has also been great. Highly reccomend! :)
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,BEST online shopping. I'm delighted with my purchase. I'll keep shopping with them. The quality of materials is good. The delivery times & tracking make you know where your item is so I'm very please with it. Its a very simple app. I've 4 kids. Outfits clothes is one of item I always orderd. If you bought more clothes and spend certain amounts of money you will get discount and free shipping which is great for family with more kids. I just hope SHEIN put more selection on kid toy. ❤❤❤❤❤ SHEIN
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely love everything about Shein. Clothes are excellent quality and very well made, superb prices, and very easy to return through Evri with very quick refunds. The jewellery is particularly excellent, very cheap but absolutely stunning and amazing quality. Gorgeous handbags and accessories too. Sizing can sometimes be a bit off but generally is spot on. I always read reviews before I order but rarely disappointed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Easy app to use. What helps a lot is that one can follow up on the app with one's order (easily trackable) and also the reviews on the app from other customers helps to know what size to choose. Also brilliant is with every size you can choose the app gives you the measurements from the hight, bust, waist etc."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The Customer Support system is extremely poor. They sent a wrong package and I am still waiting for my return to be picked up. Everytime you have to go to an executive and explain the issue all over again and they end up providing no support. It is very dissatisfying, Hope they improve their customer service."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like the selection the app but it would be nice to have a filter to only show APPROPRIATE teen clothing and easily hide things that should not be worn by a teenager. I hate having to go though page's of low cut, barely qualifying as a shirt items to find the cool stuff a teen gi could wear. You need a juniors section."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love there clothes & there prices! Just check the sizes & the comments to see what u need. First return is free after it's $7.99. They have full outfits that are cute stylish good quality & not cheap looking for $13-$30. They also sell jewelry, make up >$6 & bags for >$3-30$. I tried a cheap foundation and it was a really good full coverage one. I was trippin on how good it was. Also the cheapest lipstick was amazing & longlasting. I was able to lip contour without it looking funny."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great apart from anytime I win I don't. Recieve anything even though I spend quite a lot every month
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I 🧡 shein. Clothes are good quality. Prices are good and realistic so people can afford them. Sizes are are true to size 90% of the time but having real reviews and photos from other buyers is what's great about it. Delivery is longer than most but worth the wait. You can have refunds put back in a shein wallet which is great or withdraw to bank account. My only bad experience was I requested the withdrawal of my money from the wallet and didn't get it all back and still havnt.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I LOVE SHEIN!! I love everything i have purchased, i have yet to be disappointed. Amazing items and a shout out to the people responsible for getting the orders picked & shipped out. They are on point. I have purchased close to 100 items from SHEIN and they never made any mistakes ON MY ORDERS. You truly get what you purchased. Shipping & delivery is amazing. Keep up the fantastic job SHEIN."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am a first timer on Shein. Collection is good hence I placed an order but there is NO DELIVERY DATE ASSIGNMENT. This makes the entire experience undependable in terms of dispatch and delivery. We can't shop with a certain date (even 10 days away) in mind. This allows logistics to take days, weeks or months. It is HIGHLY UNRELIABLE when there is no set timeline."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love it. They deliver early, the clothes are very acceptable for the prices. I'm always able to match my daughter for family pictures. I love how it's bagged separately. I always Google the sizes if it's not a US size and it works out. The only problem I have is when ordering something other than clothes it's not always are expected."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love Shein and love the App❤️ Most definitely recommend it, just made two orders, they arrived on the time they said and obtained the best prices ever!!! The App is very easy to use and is helpful because you can order any time though your device and specially keep track of your orders. Has good pictures and all the info you need."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app for shopping. My definite favorite! I love how you can easily organize loved items into boards for easy access when you are ready to purchase. Clothing is fashionable and very affordable. The downside is quality- you must read reviews. Overall, very happy with this app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Used to be good. SHEIN used to be one of my fave shopping site. But they have become the worse. My last 3 order experiences are terrible. one got revoked one was delivered like a month later. And the current order is still processing its been 10 days. I will not recommed shein at all. Maybe in future if they resolve this. contacted customer care like 100 times and all they say it comforting lies.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love their style of clothes, their clothes are so affordable and you get points when reviewing the clothes you bought. The only challenging thing is when you dont which sizes to buy coz you end up buying wrong sizes but but besides that I love the app 💕 they have categories of clothes you can get in one app, I highly recommend"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I think they need to stop the having a minimum use for points please bring the unlimited use for points its not fun anymore please bring it back SHEIN
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Do not download this app!!! I was genuinely excited to try out Shein I loved the price of their clothes and They looked good in the pictures on the website. I downloaded the app to get the discount but if you do that uninstall the app immediately because I was literally getting ads every 5 minutes!!!! I kept it installed so I could track My package only to have a show up and half the things I ordered were unwearable! The lowest quality clothes I have ever purchased and I shop at thrift stores!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's the best, they acknowledge all available top rated trends, it even gives look ideas, to say which one goes best with which😍💯it's something else! U can literally spend ur day at sheinland(the app) its wonderful! As for discounts, endless, I just love it! U might like sumn on a person n ask urself where they shop! Well that's easy, Shein😎"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"All the clothes I ordered were in GREAT QUALITY and they all turned out how I expected! I ordered a few boots as well, FANTASTIC!!!! They fit me great and they feel so darn comfortable!!!! All Shein's stuff is so inexpensive and you can find practically anything on the online store that is 80% cheaper than any other store and it also comes in great quality! This is definitely my GO-TO store!❤️ I have the app and my notifications are on too so I can get notified for any of Shein's good deals!! 😍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've purchased numerous items from SHEIN and have never had a problem. Everything has always fit TTS (True to size) and looked exactly like what the pictures shown. My favorite thing to get from here is the lingerie! Ladies, it won't let you down!! *Edited to add* Still OBSESSED with this app. Slowly gaining a whole new wardrobe of shein! Love love love! **Edited to add again** STILL obsessed with SHEIN. The only place i get my lingerie. 1st place I recommend to anyone asking."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love shein and cannot recommend it enough to people! I've never been into clothes and always found it exhausting trying to find something that's my style and fits nicely, since I've downloaded shein I've found, and bought so many nice pieces! I do advise checking the reviews and measuring yourself on some items as everyone is different."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,U don't take long with my orders I with I had enough mo Ney to order more items
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love Shien! There is so many cute clothes, and accessories that make me feel like me! Not only that but they have the most amazing deals! However, I give a 4/5 because they're are some extremely revealing clothes that I could never where in public. Other than that, Shien is an excellent shopping site, and I recommend to anyone who loves shopping for cute clothes and looking for great deals."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Fantastic site, so easy to use, and simple free delivery and returns make it my favori Great prices Mostly high quality products Sizes true to size I do a large order every month I love Shein I've had some really beautiful items of clothing and very impressed with the shoes and flip flops also. Thankyou Shein....I would go so far as to say I'm slightly addicted lol : ) My only improvement would be please no more sharp labels in seems where they cant be cut out without damaging clothing items."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love, love , love SHEIN. I used to use BOOHOO but was getting disappointed with some of the clothes looking tatty and bad stitching. Every item I have received from SHEIN have been beautiful and nicely packaged. The Clothes, makeup and everything else sold on SHEINS site are easy to access and have a variety of colours, if an item you want has been sold out, SHEIN give you other items similar to look at. I highly recommend SHEIN. I will definitely continue to use them. What a fab on line App!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I loved seeing until they sold my account info and someone took over my account. Now I can't do anything because they changes the email.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app 👍 and shows is a very beautiful outfits to every event to help the girls and women to choose the best look every day, but the only problem is that the videos in ""Gals"" stay the same and don't get updated, without this problem this app is amazing 👌 also it's very easy to use and has a very good prices for the items and clothes in it"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"( ""UPDATE"" ) I've managed to reach out to the customer service but its not helpfull at all. Guess my stolen 5$ will say goodbye forever. Ps: order at your own risk and this is my 1st and last ordering in this app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"honestly i really like this app, i really have no complaints whatsoever. i only was able to afford clothes from thrift shops but SheIn is very affordable and helpful with not only clothes, but makeup, hair accessories, shoes and more. and to top it all off, the more points u get, the more things you can buy with the points. i seriously recomend! ( p.s the clothes are super cute!!)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The service of shein is worst. They deliver your product very late and if you want to return the product, they have ""tantrum"" for it too. They even do not have a proper customare care service. Online shopping from other websites are much more better and easier. Very disappointed with the experience. Edit- Quality is cheap as expected as it is from ""china"".. #Chinal lied#people died... UNINSTALLING IT!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I am a loyal customer of Shein. Unfortunately they changed the courier that delivers the orders at Greece. Speedex is the worst of the courier companies and they didn't deliver my last orders in time. Although they have my order they didn't give it to my despite that I went there every day and the last time with the police. Shein didn't care at all about the situation. As a result I won't buy again and I will discarage other people to do so.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If there is something worse than 'worse' then it is this app.After I ordered, the app was showing some totally different name and address for delivery.I contacted the customer support the very next day and they assured that they have changed the address.I kept following up with them everyday but then I found out that it was almost delivered to the incorrect address.Finally after contacting the delivery company many times, and the other person,i could change the address.Still very bad products."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Terrible, unable to print a return label and chat line can't help. I'll have to find someone to file on them. Everything I've ordered since my first original order has been excellent. I have placed numerous orders since then and is very happy. I know what size to order now and everything has been great 👍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Nice style and variety of clothes and accessories. Clothes fit well according to size charts, and looking at customer reviews is very helpful if unsure! Shipping and tracking are good. I haven't had any issues with Shein and it is easily my favourite online clothing retailer. Easy to use app. I highly recommend!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very simple and easy to work with.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"By far my favorite shopping app, especially for buying new lingerie. And the merchandise is always of high quality and very reasonably priced. Shein has a huge selection of different items, everything from t-shirts, jeans, dresses, shoes, purses, jewelry, (and body jewelry too) accessories and they also have a great selection of home decor and useful household products as well. I've never been disappointed with any of the many, many purchases I've made from Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good it is, Easy to use , i also like the fact that their items are hardly out of stock and the fact that most of their items have variety of colours to choose from...i also like the fact that each an every item has atleast 5 pics of showing us how it looks like . And the reason why i didnt give it 5 stars its becouse of their delivery amount, its too expensive ."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is quite amazing interms of many things ,first and foremost I could see that the products are quite affordable than other brands,secondly there are lots and lots of varieties amongst the clothes,which are trendy,comfortable and fashionable One thing,I was really fond of shein was the shein points, which helped me very much while placing my orders❤❤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The worse app ever and the worse agent they don't provide a proper service. I requested an exchange for a dress and it was available but still I got a refund (less amount) they said it's out of stock even when it was available when I ordered, I said I could wait until it's restocked but there's no response the agents ends the chat in between. The worst app ever."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Nothing but good things to say here. I've made 3 quite big orders so far, with absolutely no issues whatsoever. Clothes have been good to excellent in quality and the deals are excellent. Delivery is quifas even and always arrived early or within timescale. Also delivery could be cheaper for smaller orders but luckily mine have all qualified for free. Im a happy customer so far, I'm hooked on the site. 😀"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I don't really like to shop, my fashion is terrible, but with Shein, it's way easier. They remind me and suggest what size i am and it is way easier to have to get things that match since the fashion is on a person, rather then on a rack and i have to figure it all out 😆 based on one mannequin."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I just love shein. Am not a brand freak person. So I love shein's product all the time. The styles of clothes are very nice and trendy within very low price. Sometimes for the sizing issue I exchange clothes. But it doesn't make me disappoint at all. I wanna request to shein for one thing only that please deliver orders as quick as possible.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I order 12 times through shein.I used to received the orders on time. The prices are too low thus even if something is larger than elwhat I need I can fix it and the total price is fine. I need to fix only the high wrist pants. All the other clothes are good to size. The quality is good. I can find everything that I need
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have placed 4 different orders, each with multiple items, on Shein. I have been pleased with them all. Clothes are better quality than the price suggests and the styles are cute and fit wonderfully! The app is great bc it makes buying things a breeze and the shipping is USUALLY faster than quoted by as much as a week."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Annoying that I cannot modify my purchase at the check out screen..a message prompts me explaining that I can lose my points and there's a timer ticking down. Well, what if I'm just remembering to add the coupon now at the end? And I'm just selecting my payment method. There should be an option to enter coupons in at any point as long as I didn't hit confirm payment and paid it.."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"My problem or their problem rather' is that u end up paying a lot more than the actual items. And its so unfair having to pay for shippin & tax again. I complained after someone advised me as they had the same exp' but was refunded. but to my suprise, i did not get any assistance at all. So I'm not entirely sure about the service.Products are good but overall service should be better! If ur policy says refund a customer it must apply to all customers not the youtubers only. We all payin'!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this company! I get literally all of my clothes and shoes from here - work and casual. It's cheap and good quality, shipping is fast and return policy is great! Customer service has always been great but the best part is that I rarely even need to contact customer service because I just generally don't have issues with the app, payment, product, etc! Highly recommend"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I would give it a five star rating if it didn't have consistency issues with browsing for specific categories. Things just randomly disappear from categories and I can't find them again until they pop up somewhere else. Also the limits with browsing for specific things. It gets angry when you filter things down with more than three options and it gets angry when you use no filters at all. I find it pretty janky personally.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I am MORE than impressed...I'm PRETTY ASTONISHED 😲 From the ease of the app regarding the Wish List...which stays up-to-date regarding inventory...my FAVORITE feature of offering suggestions based on your choice...the reviews & photos are wonderful...and the clothing offer TRUE sizes for BBWs! Even the carrier.. DHL and the tracking process on the app works seamlessly in deploying texts regarding processing of order & shipping! Great experience ALL around!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Poor deceiving apps letting you to download to claim a reward but all your invites is just a waste they won't accept
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Make the clothing reviews easier! The app is okay. Lots of deals. It is really nice the fact we can add our dimensions to be comparative tool for someone else considering buying it, but *Please, make it easier! *We could create profiles for the reviews and save our body shape/type and size there. It is time consuming adding the same information for each single piece of clothing I bought. I love the fact the app incentives reviews. Indeed, it made a difference on my purchase."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Don't think twice about buying from this app, just do it! Customer service is amazing and there's reviews on products from around the world if you're skeptical. I have had some issues with some of my products not being delivered possibly due to the high amount of orders during the holidays but they will refund or reship with no problem. I don't shop for nothing in store anymore besides food and hygienic care. SHEIN has everything you need fr ya'll. And the shipping is FAST!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"(Don't mind the username I have 9 kids) This app is honestly so bad, yes the clothes are cheap but- THEY ARE CHEAP. The quality is so bad and some clothes comes months later, getting a bathjn suit in November isnt it. Plus alot of the clothes don't even look good. I've made multiple purchases for my daughters and it really is disappointing when half the clothes aren't in the same size or colors."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Definitely one of the better apps for whatever you're shopping needs, easy to use and deliveries are usually pretty good too, would recommend ordering over $100.00 mark as small orders I assume take a back seat in the pecking order, there are lots of payment options too. Also though the prices are competitive the items on sale far exceeds what you think you get as I have found, better than eBay for certain things, the quality is surprisingly good."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app there are great deals, and amazing clothing as well as many other items. The activities are a fun way to get points to use toward final prices. Its great so many items you can just keep looking and find awesome items bad part your spending more money than you may want just because of all the great items to choose from. Love shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely love this app!! A plethora of items ranging from clothes, to accessories, to home decor. All super cheap, and majority of the time it's perfectly good quality. Highly recommended you at least have a browse, as you're sure to find something you'll love xx"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"ITS COMPLETELY HORRIBLE! THEY AUTOCANCELLED MY ORDER! And when i asked them about it they said they sent me Confirmation Emails, when i never got any!!! I even checked Spam, there are No Emails! Without even calling or getting a proper confirmation they just AutoCancel! totally disappointed. Huge waste of time really. spent a good 2-3 hours in sale to get the right item for right price to use the Shein Points i collected, that too was a waste of time."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I was very pleased with the things that I ordered and how fast I got my order delivered very good quality for such an affordable price. Great Company
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is stupid. I made an order and the amount was deducted from my account. Then, same stupid risk verification issue for the same account and same payment method and the same card (not even a credit card) asked by the stupid system once again. First they asked for a transaction screenshot and next day asked me to send dedit card pics and an identity card. Canceled the order and asked for the refund. Idiots with an idiot outdated system who don't know the difference of Debit and Credit cards."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great experience, everything I have bought has fit both myself and my customers. I was never disappointed. Great place to shop. I can get everything for my home, pets and daughter in various colour and in season styles. I really find it balancing without having to be checking other sites. Everything under one roof is the best option for me as a working mom and a business woman. My household is extremely happy, never a late delivery, never had to send back anything. Delivery time is also great"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love the app. My only complaint is let's say there are 900 pages of women's shirts, you look through 60 of those pages then stop. When you decide you want to look again you have to scroll through those same 60 pages to get to new things you haven't seen before. It's very draining and time consuming. There should be a way to jump pages or resume where you stopped looking. There HAS to be a better way. When it's fixed I'll give a 5 stars."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Do not download this app. customer service is so poor. I tried multiple times but no response from their side. Moreover they don't provide return pick up facility and when I tried to courier then the address also they have provided , the courier facility is not provided there. I don't know how to return the product. So my experience is so far very bad with shein. Kindly provide me the solution @SHEIN asap."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have been using SHEIN for a few years and it has been a great experience so far. The price of products are so affordable, choosing your size has been simple based on the size charts and reading other people's reviews on products and my orders have all been on time. I just love it!❤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Slow replies slow solve problems they received my money then discuss with me to send bank transaction haha why recived my money if you will disscusse!? also why asking about bank info that is private info not allowed to share like that with any one I am not feel safe when I order from them so I will delete this application and tell all my friends about my bad experience with shein I order from them 2562 AED they didn't respect me they didn't deel with customers love shopping high cost.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,As a skinny woman the sizing is to big for the teen section
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great prices. Solid quality. Besides the rare sizing issue I love shopping with SHEIN. The only misgiving I have is that when I do experience a sizing issue, I have to wait for all of the items in my order to arrive in order to mark it received and then process a return on the one item I had an issue with. Seems like there could be a more user friendly way to do that but I still love this company"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! It's easy to navigate, quick to load and never glitches!! The brand is awesome! The prices are ideal and quality is good. Always read the reviews to get a better idea of the product as the advertised product can be misleading. Takes awhile to recieve items, but for the price, I don't mind the wait."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Almost all of the items i ordered weren't qualities as it was displays and the were telling me to return it myself with my money before refund. The qualities is bad and the size as it displays isn't match pls i want my money back at if it's half of the items i can still manage the others 4 out of the items aren't manageable if not i will pay for the rest of items coming on the way. Thanks
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"*edit"" ordered twice. still super satisfied 🤸 I ordered only once so far but definitely going to order more as I had an amazing experience! delivery came within a few weeks, perfectly packed, app interface is super easy to use - make sure you read reviews of everything before purchasing!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love using the Shein app because it easier to use but we need more ways to get point, lower customs fees and more of Sale. Be able to make successful returns and refunds, tracking and communication between the buyer and the seller. Some materials needs to be improved like leather bags and bottoms and most especially those that are see through."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have always had a great experience using the Shein app, and also shopping at Shein. Everything I've ordered has been perfect! It's just very important you read comments/reviews, look at size guides, and measure. The app itself is great. Easy to navigate, and shop. There are also a ton of ways to earn points with Shein - which translates to cash! You can also create little fashion pieces to share with others. All in all I am a big Shein supporter, and highly recommend using this app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Always fresh clothes, always on the trends, and always arrives within a reasonable time with the correct items. I've had a good few purchases over the years and tried a few budget fashion apps, this is the one I come back to. Klarna makes it easy to justify by splitting it into 4 payments, too."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's is a fantastic sight but is let down by its customer service contact and returns, it is very unclear and difficult to follow, far too little choice options for customers to convey any issues they may need to resolve. Hence my friend no longer uses it but like me loved the range of clothing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love ordering from shein and the the app makes it 10 times easier. Navigating through this app is easy and anyone can do it. The customer service is very friendly. No ads and the clothes all arrive in perfect condition. Definently recommend
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have ordered many times on shein and have always had a great experience....out of the probably 300 items I've bought maybe 2 have not really been up to the expectation that they said on the website. Other then that I've used them to get stuff not only for myself but for friends and family for birthdays Christmas and special occasions. Pricing is not only excellent but Shipping is fast and I always get super excited when the stuff arrives🎉🎊🥳🥰
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I ordered from this app many times. It has good no. Of Collections. I'm frustrated from it's shipping services the worst shopping app it is.. I placed my order on 19th October and it's not delivered yet. I complained many times they never take any kind of action. Even my exchange order is not delivered yet. Worst customer service. And my order is prepaid. Just fooling people
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Love the prices and so many modest dresses that are so hard to find for my daughter. She's tall for her age so dresses are always too short but with Shein I can see the length before purchasing which allows me to size up if needed. Just wish there was less viscose material and more cotton. That's only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Shein is awesome. My wife and I have made seceral orders and have always been happy. The quality of their clothing is better then expexted for the price. Their app is easy to use and has all the good features that make browsing easier and more fun. There an easy access whishlist and sublists too. Also informs me of price changes in lists. Lots if coupons and discounts olus free shipping times. The size charts tell the measurements when you select a size! Awesome app!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing clothes, beauty products and etc. Probably my favourite place to buy my clothes from. 100% an easy app to use! There are no ads, the app is easy to use and the shipping is before the date it is supposed to be shipped. I hope this rating helps you to get it because it is the best app on my phone. It is so cheap and always has discounts. It also restocks quit quickly."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,it's been 19 days and I still didn't receive my delivery! it was estimated 11-15 days!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Almost everything I've bought fits perfectly. I read reviews first and compare sizes and pics to make sure it's something that'll fit. Gotta be careful to check the measurements. Some things are cut to fit smaller sizes but will say Large and Extra Large. Be sure to look and check sizing before you buy. Plus if something doesn't fit, I usually get a free exchange as long as I return the item."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great,so far I've only ordered clothes for my daughter but all come as seen online, and sizes have been perfect for her, and believe me she is difficult to buy for over the years, as ive found in most highstreet shops either too big on waist and either too short or too long on leg, or fit her on waist and too short on leg, with shein all have fit perfectly, there can be a long wait for delivery but I don't mind so much, as so far not needed something desperately!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I just recently made my first purchases (20 items) from Shein and was amazed at the prices and quality of everything. It was easier than some of the other clothing apps also to be able to find the right size. Everything fits perfectly and true to size! I will very seldomly be ordering from Amazon anymore.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Everything I have ordered I have received within the delivery time. I have had no issues at all so far and I have been using shein for about 8 months. I have only ordered a couple of items of clothing but they were generous in size. Everything else I have ordered, cushions, moulds, have been good quality for the price. Could just do with more coupons at 20% off which I used to get when I first ordered 😊 please 😁"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm very disappointed, all the time I have been using this app it's been great until recently, I made an order late February and for a whole month it was stuck in transit with no updates at all, at first they said my order couldn't be delivered so they sent it back to sender, I re ordered that same order, and it got stuck in tranist for a whole month. And today as usual I was checking to see if there is an update, just to find out that they removed the order, and no money back on my account😡😡"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"So far I like this app. Some of the stuff is really low priced and most of the stuff I've ordered has been pretty good. Even if it does take a long while to arrive which is a small down side but arrives in great shape so that is a plus. I also like the idea of coupons and points that are implemented, I recently bought a ton of stuff for a pretty good price."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,We had 2 options for delivery to Jordan..both were free for a certain amount of purchases.. First you removed the economic shipping then you made the express shipping costs too expensive! We're already paying 10% for the customs here so it's not worth it anymore Besides you removed all of my coupons after the upgrade and contacting the support didn't help😶 I also had quality issues in my last orders.. So I ended up with expensive bad products!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is so good ! There's a large variety of things to buy ranging from clothes to house decor . It's so easy to organise your fav items since you can make boards after adding them to your favourites . One thing I will complain about is how long it takes for things to ship sometimes but I don't really mind . Overall , it's an amazing app !! Definitely recommend"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shein is perfect for buying cheap cute clothing. All products are not the greatest quality but a lot are great quality. Shein has a huge variety of clothing, accessories, and other things. The sizes are standard sizes, but read the reviews of products before purchasing! They help a lot!! Hope this review helps"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoy using this app. There are so many options beyond clothes that are amazing finds. I've purchased shoes, birthday supplies and little nick knacks for my home. The only thing I think is missing would be a component that offers up ""matching"" or ""complementary"" items to something you've decided to purchase. It would be a way to put an outfit together, or a jewelry set for example. Other than that its a great app and shopping experience."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have placed a couple of orders with Shein, and have been pleasantly surprised by the look/quality of the products considering the low pricing. My orders have come within a reasonable amount of time, and I love that there are plenty of options for curvier gals! Would recommend others try it out!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Your products are good, but you are unnecessarily charging shipping cost and also you take too much time for products shipping, exchange, return or refund of the products. These factors are very vital in these days to retain your customers. It should be like other e-commerce websites like myntra and amazon. Its been 4-5 days i have cancelled the order but the status of the order is not updated on the portal and signs of refund. This is very disappointing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,i love shein. I buy stuff of avg 4k each month from shein and every time the items I get are unexpectedly amazing. all the stuffs are exactly thr way they are shown in the picture.. I loved the fact that they showed me a memory of completing 1 year with Shein. don let the quality drop. although I didn't have to return anything till date but would love to see a easy return process like myntra or amazon.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I gave it a try and ordered some tops and an eyeshadow palette. Oh and a really cute pair of shades that was only $4. I waited a little over a week for my order to show up. The clothes were made of quality material. I'm glad I took the risk because they have some awesome deals on clothes! Some of the stuff is a little iffy looking but that number is low compared to how much stuff is worth buying. They could use better looking shoes and more home products. I'm going to buy more stuff for sure!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have started continuously shopping from shein and i realized one things that is whenever i use shein points they cancel my order saying that it is ""out of stock"" or ""delay in transition"", one of my order is still on its way from past 10days and i am dead sure that this one is also going to get cancelled. I dont understand if yall dont want to allow us to use the points then why on earth y'all give it. If my order doesnt reach me i would never recommend anyone to shop from here."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is my favourite app it has everything I could think to look for at the best prices; and with the quality also amazing. .what a great deal. In my personal experience no other apps to compare. I'll be a lifetime shopper from shein. They are genius at showing what interest you by the product that you look at and show interest in the most. That alone saves you time.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very good way to own a lot of good quality clothes at a low price. 1% of the time I got poorly made stuff but for the most part I have been satisfied 99% of the time. I see things on shein that are on other sites for for double the price. I love how they give points to use to get discounts off your purchases and discount codes as well. Shipping is very affordable. I love it!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein! I have had a great online experience, which is rare. I love clothes again. It is affordable and fashionable. I would love it if every top or bottom listed had a few suggestion options that match the item. Sometimes ibthinkba top will match the bottoms but when it arrives, the colors are off"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It has beautiful things and the shipment never disappoint 👏😘 Ur order gets delivered about 7-10 working days,clothes are so unique and u must compare sizes as the cuts are not the same eg I wear large bt in most cases I order XL especially in pants den as for t-shirts I look and the cut den I decide which one to take. U also get points to use to decrease ur payment n also there are coupons making sure u pay less amount ,the shipment fee is free for orders more Dan 999. I love the shop❤️🧡💛"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"First time ordering from the app. Would love it if shipping didn't take as long! Only two tops out of my order worked out. One of the shirts was poorly made. The seams didn't match up, the high/low was completely off center. I'm going to try again with other items, and hopefully it works!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I find the app pretty good. The clothes are in style, true to size and inexpensive. It has a lot of vouchers and points to be used for the discount. It is easy to see my orders and tracking information. The quality of the items are good and I can easily find a substitute if the item I was looking has no available size. I am always satisfied with the items."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I am OBSESSED with SheIn. The app is easy to navigate and coordinates perfectly with the website. The quality of clothing is truly surprising in the best possible way. The only thing I'd like to see improve is the ability to update reviews. Once an item is reviewed it's locked unless you delete the old comment and do a completely new review.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"App is super easy to use and love that it alerts you on what discounts are available. The selection is amazing especially for plus size gals and the prices are very competitive. While some items can be a miss, overall most items are great. Love it!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like the app and the clothes a lot. The delivery and return policy is also good. The only reason why I take off 2 stars and do not order as frequent as I would like, is the amount of plastic they use. For each delivery, each individual item is packed separately in a plastic bag. Completely unnecessary and wasteful. In today's world unacceptable. I wish they would change that and soon."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein's products. Love the styles, the quality is good, the custom service is incredible!!! Imidiatly they attend to your issues and solves them promptly taking the customers seriously and respectfully.A suggestion is when a products is showcased with the details when someone wants to make a purchase the model showcasing the product ( let's say a top) is wearing something well put together and matching (bottom) and I'll love buying the bottom too yet there is no refferance to it anywher"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Ok i been buying from shein for a while now,yes they got cute clothes but some are really cheap material,ima be honest the coupons are not all that they dont give you a fair discount and most of the time you HAVE to meet the required amount of money for your coupon to work. Its hard to get POINTS when( you put good information on your review)and get 0 likes meanwhile theres other people with 200+ likes for reviews that have nothing helpful about the item instead random letters,pictures or songs."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app works relatively well. A few times wouldn't let me scroll down anymore so I rebooted the app. Service wise, The first 2 orders I placed with Shein were amazing. Service was excellent, so quick and NO mistakes were made. Impeccable! However, the 3rd and 4th order was the worst experience I've ever had with any company. I ordered on december 29th, got lots of items that turned out to be unavailable up to 10 days after ordering. What's happening at that point?? Dropped 3 stars. Sad service."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The clothes are good and reasonably priced. I wished they had a seperate category called ""Earth tones"". They used to have that but now it's not there. It still needs better category and filter options and better sizing guide and material description."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have just recently started online shopping. So far so good. SheIn provide good value for the prices. I have been surprised by the size and quality of the goods I have received so far. Delivery is usually faster than predicted. And you have the possibility of getting free shipping even if you order 1 item. Just choose delivery at convenience store and you're good to go. Really, for the meantime I'm quite satisfied with the service & already started recommending around me :)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this app and so many of the products. Great pricing. Constant shipping deals means it's easy to get free shipping, and there's lots of sales, coupons, and discounts to get things even cheaper. Can find even more online. Option to play for more. Order 1-2 sizes up with clothing if you're in US/CAN as these are European/Asian sizes. Longer shipping time as it's coming from China, but still comes faster than Amazon stuff from China!! Products arrive excellently packaged. Highly recommend."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Easy to order and easy to return. Good quality cloth!! Love it. The only thing is that you have to be careful when you take the vouchers automatically off... they quite often take the 15% or the £3 voucher off, when you could have had 20% of your order"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I think that they have a good website and lovely designs, but the quality for the price is not always good...stitching, and fabrics can be a huge problem. For example, I purchased a $40 dress that had very bad quality and a very sheer fabric for which I won't be able to get my money or custom taxes back on top of paying for return"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have made quite a few purchases from Shein and was a little sceptical due to the low prices, but I have been over the moon with this company. Highly recommended. From the range and speedy delivery it gets a score of 10 out of 10. Also on one occasion I had to return an item and it was again a simple and easy request 🙂 Don't hesitate...START SHOPPING NOW"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I would give shein a 5 star rating if I was able to adjust the sizing for the bathing suits. It only let's you choose one size for both pieces and you can't exchange after you purchase. I need a medium bottom and small top and they don't offer an option to do that.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Easy to use. Lots of great items. I'm a plus sized woman & I have been able to purchase several summer dresses that fit me. I also bought a nice fanny pack for when I'm walking the dogs & a good water bottle. All things I've seen on other online shopping sites for much more. Standard Shipping is about 1.5-2 weeks. My first order was placed the 23rd of June & was delivered the 1st of July.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Omg my cart is full and I can't afford it all but I can't decide what I want! There's so much to choose from and as a bigger person, I really appreciate the plus size clothing 🥺❤ there's always clothes I see in stored that are cropped or too tight or only fitting for skinny legends, but I feel so accepted here 😭 thank you Shein, it was really easy to navigate the sizes and colors, and also the reviews are very helpful! Lifesaver! Never going back to department store shopping ❤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app! Clothes are very cheap, but still of good quality. It takes a while before things get delivered, but I think it's worth it! Tip: use Klarna as a payment method. That way you are sure you'll only pay once the clothes arrive and if you make a return you don't have to pay. I used Shein before and didn't get a refund for an order that never arrived... So do be careful."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Its way better than expected. The quaility has been great, i have not been disapointed with anything. The draw backs are how long it takes to get to me. Which has been about 3 weeks every time. The next thing is sizing you do have to read every size chart and reviews on the product you want but honestly its no worse than going to a clothing store, there will always be hits and misses."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Every product so far that I have received has been in such great condition. I'd give it 5 stars if I have been using it longer. I'm a cheap person, so getting deals on clothes and other stuff is my favorite part. I bought jewelry too and it turns out just like the pictures. So ready for pay day so I can get some stuff off of my wishlist."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It was my very first order with shein, of which one of the order item did not fit me well and I wanted to return it,to which I was informed they do not have pick up facility for a single item return order. I pay out of my own pocket and return it. One of the other item was delivered broken to which I was told that the broken item is non returnable. No refund or exchange has been done for either of the two products. Absolutely dismal. Never ever ordering from therm again. NOT AT ALL RECOMMENDED."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I like a lot their designs and I the pieces I ordered seem very good quality. I did three orders already and all seems to be delivered around 2 weeks. love the packaging and fabric. Theres one or two bad things I could say but at the end is more the good ♡ (like one time I received a flipper without a detail in one foot or it seems it doesn't have all designs in larger size). LOVE SHEIN ♡
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"They are so good, I accidentally ordered two pieces of the same product. Before shipping the product, they called me up and confirmed if I needed two pieces of the same product and that's when I realized I ordered two by mistake. No shopping app would have done that but they did. They saved my time and money. Thank you :) and the Products are trustworthy and fab! 👏but should mention expected delivery date so that we can buy accordingly for any occasion!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,In all I would rate it three and a half star but I can't do that so I was cool and gave it a four star but when it comes to jewelry I wished better attention would be paid to it because there has been multiple times that I have gotten jewelry and a jewel will be missing out of it and that just ruins the whole thing for me because it's always so noticeable and I can never find the right size to go back in it to fix it myself and it's so aggravating to try and send something back especially someth
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like the convenience of an app. However when you're scrolling, once you get to like item #1000 out of 4000 it will freeze or start over. It also loses my place once you get so far down the list and starts it over. (Update) There's scroll function has been fixed and the app works great now."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Lobe this app. Can't find a way to earn points except daily check in reviews if purchase and create a style. I find that is hard to get high as so many have vote me I vote you going on. I have one other app I love and they have a larger variety of ways to earn. I've searched but found nothing else. Possibly getting a few more price guessing as example or a few other ways. I can't seem to get past the dress up which is pre arranged with so many I've entered with no fighting chance.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This very horrible. I can't use none of the mini games. And when I try to delete my account y'all tell me I can't. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Very bad.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Is very function especially the filter section. It will be great if developer can develop filter for 'exclude' option. Because whn browsing, I use the ""filter"" alot to save time and I can't exclude the things that I don't want. For example ; I want a sweetheart neckline top but I do not want a crop top . Hope u can consider."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I rate this 1 star because in the beginning i ordered a few nice clothes and was pleased with the results i don't use shein often but recently i had charges on my card from shein that I did not order. 150 dollars have been stolen and I never once made any purchases that can cause this. they wiped all my money clean and over draft my card and when I checked to see if I ordered things by mistake there was nothing there. I uninstalled the app and will no longer be using shein. Do not use this app!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I had downloaded more than a few clothing apps more than a week ago. I was searching for some that had the best items, at a reasonable price. I was starting to get discouraged after the first 4 apps, and didn't see anything that caught my eye!. So by the time I got to SHEIN, my expectations had certainly dropped!. But to my surprise, I couldn't believe the beautiful dresses, accessories, etc. And the low prices! I LOVE this App!! And I believe they have the largest selection of leggings!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really like this app, easy to use and have no problems yet, just make sure to check the sizes as they differ from piece to piece but amazing all the way! I get afford nice quality clothes straight to my home and the point system is amazing, you can use them as soon as you get them or you can just save them up!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Worst experience. Ordered items from this app but didnt received items on time. Never recommend.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app. My items always arrive before the delivery date. I have brought loads of bits off here. Womens and Older girls clothes and shoes and they have all been great quality. The stitching on the clothes is great. For great prices the clothing is brilliant. The only thing is you can not use LayBuy on here which is a pity. But apart from that I 100% recommend this app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Totally in love with this app. It's best clothing app until now. They notify each and everything so well regarding the transit, delivery of the product etc. The quality and stuff of the clothes will never ever dissatisfy you. Exciting features include live streaming , daily check ins, awesome flash sale, flexible return policy, customer grievance cell, much appreciable exchange policy and many more. Above all it's trendy and has a top notch fashion statement."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The range of styles is wondrful and for a person like me who loves wearing any and all styles. I love that you get the full measurement details for the clothes so you can match it to your own from the waist, hips, chest/bust and even shoulders it makes it much easier to make sure you do get the right size everytime. You can even get extra details on the fabirc and if it has non strech, medium strech, or if its is very strechy. The decor as well is amazing. Overall love the quality and range."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this app so far! It's affordable, works properly, gives you points easily and so much more! I highly recommend shopping on this app if you like trendy clothes and cute stuff, especially the accessories are so cute and unique, honestly I don't think I have any complaints even the shipping is decent, it only takes about 5 days to a week for the item to come."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have never had issues with the app and have been using it for a couple of years now, although I have had a few items missing from a couple of parcels i have been more than happy with their customer service. The clothes are generally of high quality and the selection of products available is wonderful from bits for the home, makeup, obviously clothes for the whole family, shoes etc. Have a look for yourself and try them out, the offers are incredible and worth a try. What have you to lose? 😀"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Easy to navigate. Great prices as well as great selection. This is not only on summer clothing, but you will find great prices on winter clothing as well. Looking forward for the arrival of my order. I just placed my first order today, and store has a decent rating. So we will see how my items are when they come in. Will update rating then if necessary."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Lovely app, Needs more color variety with the models. Easy navigation. Problem, just because they say you can return them doesn't mean you'll get your refund. 1st time buyer here. My experience was great til I noticed I didn't receive my refund from my returns and that the tracking system stuck on day 1. 🙃 Fake address to a fake warehouse? Where did my pkg go to? I could have sold those clothes. Ah well. My fault for not sizing up and more."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely love this app! Make sure you check in daily to get points, I didn't know I had to click the points and check in at first. But I love almost everything I've bought from here and making returns or getting refunds is very easy. They even have text chat for customer service! Many sales and most items are low price! I recommend to all my friends."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I find the prices are fantastic, size and quality depends on the item so you do need to be super vigilant on each item purchased. It's my go to stop for affordable, on trend plus size fashion. I think the new (fit) plus size is amazing. Wish there was a cross over from curve to the fit styles. The frenchy collection is a fav. Shipping is alright, take about 2-3 weeks to arrive to nsw, Australia."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"So far the quality has been better than expected, but unlike Wish, shein actually makes you return faulty or mis-sized products to get a refund, minus shipping cost. When something is structured the measurements are great, but with stretchy things they don't always list the size range, only one number, and who knows if that's stretched or flat."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I decided to try this out knowing that it was possible that the stuff would not come as advertised. I got something from most areas to see what was good and what wasn't. I was pleasantly surprised with their dresses, swim suits, lighting, canvas posters, all the home products in general were good. The only item I was unhappy with were the pants. They just didn't fit right. But the fabric quality was decent. I am considering cost in this review. Not super high quality but better than expected."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love this clothing site. The clothes are not often as appeared as pictured. The quality is somewhat cheaper than what appears pictured. However I'm happy with most of the items I have bought from here! Which has been tons of clothes! I even buy things for my sons and husband here as well! I will definitely continue to buy from here to. Great deals!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely adore this site/app . It offers a lot of popular styles and new trends, and for a lot cheaper than most other name brands. To anyone new to Shein; look at all the reviews before you purchase something. These reviews will give you a very good idea as to how cheap or nice the material is, whether the size runs small or large.. etc. There are some pretty cheap looking/feeling items I've bought in the past so I've learned to just read the reviews and have had great success! Xx"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love the reviews so I can find someone with my measurements and line up with the size I need. Size references for jewelry, bags, accessories would benefit with a visual. Say always show a pic with a size comparison item. Love the filter options, saves so much time while searching. Pretty much everything I've ordered has fit and looks good."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The app is great for XS size as it is extremely difficult to get a XS size product with proper fitting. Great discounts available. Absolutely Kawaii be it their outfits or their home decor. Reasonable rates with great points and discounts! Their black friday deals are super genuine and has great deals Daily check-in point system is just great which I could not find in any other clothing apparel app Product refund is instant Easy free trial deals Do check reviews before you buy Totally loved it!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"i ordered two bikinis and paid the express shipping fee of £12 but only 1 of the bikinis arrived in time the other package came 2 days after express shipping deadline! i was tracking each parcel everyday, 1 from Belgium 1 from china, on my account now its showing 2 packages supposedly arrived at the same time before the deadline which didnt! i kept note of the tracking numbers. Ive contacted customer support many times and are just giving generated replies. i just want a shipping cost refund!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love this site although it sucks when they have a model wearing a belt in a pic and it's not the belt that actually comes w the outfit, also I wish they would sell the actual same accessories and shoes the models wear the shoes they wear in the pics r way cuter than any I've ever seen on the site. Other than that A+ on quality for price 98% of the time. Keep up the good work!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app itself is well managed and thought out aswell asn the user interface being straightforward and easy to use with no confusion,Many bargains are to be had on here and delivery times are often met and items arrive mostly on time but sometimes a lack of updates on the tracking system makes the process more difficult as updates are given after they have happened in real time.Overall a good app and I definitely recommend."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My experience shopping with SHEIN HORRIBLE!!!! . I made several purchases. The last one I did not receive my items. They said it was delivered, but only one item was received. The remaining 16 (mostly T-shirts) pieces of items were not received by me or my mother, who is retired and always at home. I emailed them several times, and they refunded me for six dollars and changed even though I spent over seventy dollars. Never shopping with them again. I am very disappointed!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"this website allows you many ways to earn points and receive coupons. the clothes isnt always the best quality, but you get what you pay for. always read the reviews under each item. there are always many pictures and it can help you choose the right size as sometimes the sizing is off"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Shein tried, over the past 2 years, to infiltrate international markets. The modern template for success for digital shopping is to train your customers. Condition them to use yr platform with loss leaders and unbelievable prices and deals. Then to slowly take them away. General greed and asian xenophobia has hindered shein's success with government regulation. (As if they are any different than Amazon. Im so sure.) Slowed down its global spread. And probably costs them money."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Would give them a negative score if possible They are a Corrupt company Make it impossible to return items Substandard products Cheap material, no standard sizing, tshirts are cut short so you can't really wear them unless you use them as a crop top! Not good for anyone with a bust !! Lost a lot of money-buyer beware There is absolutely no recourse and no one to contact in the US Lost a box in the mail which was $300, absolutely NO one to talk to!!! A Chinese company"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I am editing my review because I use to enjoy being able to check into the app daily to increase the amount of points I would get which adds up to dollars but now SHEIN is being cheap and expiring points multiple times a day, everyday. It makes checking in pointless if my points expire within a few days."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Quality of items is sometimes good sometimes not. Don't bother doing any of the games. I invited 2 people and never got credit. Customer service refuses to assist me with this even tho the 1st rep said they could see the issue.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I ordered 12 items in May of 2023 for summer and NEVER received anything. I contacted customer support and they responded right away. I was told it was delivered to my house. I have a camera doorbell. I NEVER received anything. After that I was told they delivered it. I finally just asked for my money back and NEVER heard from them again. They stink as a company.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Absolute worst company in the world (literally), my package with purchased items never arrived. Contacted customer services, provided all necessary information, no feedback. Also contacted every courier company including the post office, no trace of my package. Biggest scam ever."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It is annoying when it keeps popping up unauthorized like a virus every second, I would like to think a person must first consent to have it displaying on your screen, but if it randomly pops up it messes up the mood"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If u want jerked around and to be made to feel like a victim of b.s. then this is the app for you! It was a complete waste of time to download it. It has some bogus spin wheel game that u never win, it just keeps telling u to invite friends. I will NEVER use SHEIN! I would not give ot any stars at all on the rating if o could!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Top notch shopping platform and I love their return policy. Will continue to choose shein for their return policy! Very very good for customers who had issues with their items! Excellent customer service too. Very polite and prompt to refund too
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"If you play the games and share your game link, you will be put on risk control and lose all ability to use your games and shein balance, and will not get it back. Posts are pouring in about dozens of people going through the same thing. Customer support is zero help. I had been a loyal customer for years and deleted my account after being cheated out of $300 and getting the run around. And as you can see by the reviews, all youre going to get is a generic copy+paste response. Bye bye, Shein!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"At first shein was great. But for the past 4 months the app hasn't been working . You can't check out getting network error messages, stuff won't sdd to your cart and worst of all there is no customer service representative to speak to. You need to fix your app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have found that items need me to order the next size up to get the fit that suits me best. The only down side is that the items are mainly made in man-made fibres mainly Polyester.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,i had shein app but upon looking staff found issues items are cheaper cost of shiping is way to expesive for single item let say item is 4 dol and they charge 9 dol shiping must be a joke you have to spend 29 Aud dol to get free shiping when u need one item what is point if you pay high postage and they give you spend 29 for free shiping i didnt use app anymore unistalled shein has lot good staff but shiping is biggest issue with people try save dollar in already expesnive economy around globe
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Ordered 9 summer shorts and 2 one piece rompers. Everything fit as expected. Prior to ordering I checked the measurements of each product and used the size guide provided as well. I took front and back pics of the 11 items along with a video of each piece as well. Hope my input assists others. Cheers everyone, and remember to enjoy your new purchases."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to buy from these people. The dresses I got were very good and fit was excellent. When they started to use couriers I stopped ordering.. I got photo of domeone elses door. Shein should update their customer service before they get a bad name because they are not a bad co. Look at their replies to revues. They don,t give a sxxx"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The recent updates took away the fun. The changes made things more confusing. And messed up the points system. Now I can't use them at all. Whoever decided to make these updates, it just made the app worse. I wish they'd go back to how it was before."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,My very first order was messed up. I'm currently discouraged from trying to use this app again. I currently use Temu and it has never messed up. In the course of 1 year I have placed 28 orders. Not a single was messed up!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like what you have, but please allow the order to arrive in Tunisia I cannot order because I am from Tunisia and live here 💔💔."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"One big issue, when I try to do a review, it can't access my photos I've taken on my camera. I took ALOT of pictures trying on clothes for the reviews/points and it's only letting me get to my camera to take pictures. Yes I checked permissions/ setting on my new galaxy 22 and it's not my phone. I had this issue with my last phone as well. I ended up going on thru the website to do it. Also they took away the curvy sizing thing. Like X body or O body to look for clothes. Was my favorite thing😢"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great prices, great quality and have everything you could want and then some. Ships really quickly. Several orders made and have yet to be disappointed. My main tip is to always check the fabric used for each item you're considering purchasing. At times I have been surprised by what was used as the material but still ended up working out pretty well."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Everything I have ordered has been shipped in a timely manor. Returns are easy, most of the clothing is true to size. The prices are amazing, I love that you can get a whole quality made outfit for half the price of retail stores. The options are amazing, you can find things in many colors, sizes, and shapes"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The program keeps changing languages on me or I'll get notifications in French. The search can't search partial terms (holo vs holographic). It does have an advantage of not having loads of multiple posting for the same item. Maybe once these are fixed I'll check it out again.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Fantastic prices. You take a gamble on the quality, which sometimes is good but sometimes it's poor. However, they have a no quibble refund policy, so you can return anything you don't like. And HUGE variety of EVERYTHING. Great kitchen and arts and crafts stuff too."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is really easy and simple to use. Most of the stuff is priced alright, some stuff is a bit pricey and getting points can be a bit tedious. My only complaint is that, if something on your wishlist goes out of stock, it will probably never be restocked, unless it's a very popular item."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Good quality clothes. Fast delivery. Nice and accurate measurements. True to size. Fashionable and affordable. Available in many sizes and styles. Quick and easy to use. Shein is my favorite app because they reel you in everytime you check in and When you sign in you don't have to start everything over again,you can just carry on where you left off.<3♡😭 😍:)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"All products reviews are fake. I bought many products and all of them are not good. Not shown as the image and very bad quality..all the accessories are plastic made like toys. And all their printings on tees and pants are very low quality. The clothes are thickless. Basically the real term ""made in china"" suits shein very well.. Please dont waste your money guys"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Its a really good place to buy clothing but the thing that concerns me is about the sizing. Some tops are too small or big and pants are too lengthy or loose. Shein should improve on their sizing and be more accurate about them in the size chart. Even the pants are too lengthy for me because i am small in height. Otherwise i love shopping from shein
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It a very good shopping app and it sometimes cheap it will very nice if they can reduce the shipping price because even when you pay standard or fast shipping your order only get delivered when it available not immediately and also if they can update the app so we can have someone to call when we have without getting charged for it or just incase you need help in using the app but keep it up I believe in you guys can make it better...
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like the fashions, they are the latest. The quality is good and the prices are reasonable. However, the sewing could be a bit rough at times but its usually on the inside. Shipping is quick. I did return an item once and to date never received the refund. Thats the reason why I cut down on buying."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Shein is a worst site. There is a huge issue with logistics and delivery. They make you wait more than a month for your order to get delivered. There is no specific phone no. To contact them and in their chat room they deliberately keep repeating the same reply again and again. Its frustrating. You never know if your parcle with reach or not. I have been trying to know the exact details of my order from past 10 days. Trying to contact shein customer services but their is no concrete response.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This app has cheap prices unlike amazon with expensive prices. Currently, there are sales ONLY for clothing which is getting on my nerves. besides, theyre only making sales on phone cases that arent my phone size (Galaxy A30s) like bro you cant just make the price for a phone case that is my phone size expensive and the other sizes cheap. When I inserted ""Lowest to highest"" the lowest was 8 SAR. And for the other sizes were only 2 SAR."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I give 5 stars just because I love Shein! The clothes, the jewelry, nic-nacs, items for every room in the house- it's everything I love in one app. They have cool things that you don't find just anywhere. The only downside is the amount of time it has taken for some of my orders to arrive, but it's totally worth the wait in my opinion!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. I think it is super easy to use. I also think it works way better than the website. No matter what device I am on, the website seems to be kind of difficult and slow, but the app is much faster and easier to use. Plus the prices of everything are so low! If you love shopping for things that are inexpensive bit still great quality, this is the app for you."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein has almost everything you can think of, and loads of things you didn't-like a clip that holds you knee length boots together? I know right? Not only that, but you will be happily surprised by the quality of the products, across the board. Oh, and customer service? You won't find better. I haven't at least. That is the absolute truth, it's why I even mentioned it, it's worth noting. Returns are easy, the prices are great, and you will find something you never knew you needed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've bought about 10 items of clothing from Shein so far, and I've only been disappointed and had to return one item. 9/10 success rate is pretty good! Items typically match the photos and fit well. Good quality for the low prices."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The orders always arrive in 2-3 weeks. I love the bags that everything comes in ( I save them to use for other items). The material is great! The style is fabulous. The fit is spot-on!!! This kicks all other plus-size clothing boutiques butts!!!! They're no competition, FRFR."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to love shopping from Shein so much so I'd order a large shipment monthly. But now, the shipping fees has increased dramatically within a month. Now there is no free shipping and fixed fee for each item! After all, we are buying online (blind buying) and there is always a chance for the item not to fit or not be same as expected. This new policy is very discouraging to take the risk of shopping online and frankly I'll be looking for another shop as this one has proven to be greedy."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've honestly had no issues with the app so far. I've ordered through the app twice and even retured items easily. Tracking on both occasions was also extremely easy. The follow up emails after either ordering or returning an item or items is informative and helpful. I'm very much enjoying SHEIN!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is insane! I haven't made an order yet but I have watched so many videos about them and shein sounds amazing! However, the items in my cart go out of stock ALL THE TIME. And I wish shein had the size 000 and 00. But I am Graydon they have petite clothing! Overall such a good app, but I wish the clothing was restocked more often in every size of the item. Shein had a variety of styles to do for and so insanely cheap! Thank you shein, and please consider my suggestion concerning stock!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's the best shopping app i don't have a problem with my orders. They deliver ahead of time and the app is really easy to navigate. I also love getting points everytime i check in the app and giving review to my orders and i love the fact that i could use my points to pay my purchase. What i love more about shein is they have a lot off good products to choose and good quality as well. Keep it up shein, don't let us down."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is Great! Shein has very nice items at shockingly low prices. There app is user friendly and follows your style choices quite closely adjusting your search as you browse. My money and time are important to me, which are both being used at a premium value at Shein. No wasted time and the best value on your quality purchases. Thanks, Shein! I feel like you get me!💙"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really like ordering from shein. I just wish the delivery wouldn't take so long Even when they make a mistake, they don't hesitate to try to resolve your issues and that's what I really like about them I like their prices and their clothes and their different items even for your pets which I've ordered some really nice pet clothes and other items for my dog. But what makes shein different from other websites is that if you have to return anything it's free"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"SHEIN's products are VERY cheap, and that's good. Although their products are also on the cheap side. You do get what you pay for. They have more than clothes though, they also have the CUTEST little trinkets and accessories! You can search up any product you're looking for. You can also check in daily for points. Points are real money, but can only be used for SHEIN purchases. For instance, if you have 548 points on SHEIN, that is $5.48 more that you can use towards purchases. I LOVE SHEIN!!!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Purchased almost $40 in items in November 2022. After excessive wait to began inquiring about order. Shipment showed it sent out in different parcels. Automated message kept showing that arrival times were experiencing delays. After a month and a half wait my last attempt to locate items or get a refund of my money was denied due to waiting too long to address the problem. .despite addressing it endlessly to be told wait yes for arrivals were experiencing delays. Never got my items or $$.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! It's so easy to find items that fit my individual style and the prices are so affordable! I love how women take real, unedited pics of themselves in the items to give other women an idea of how the items look on different body shapes and sizes!! Many include their measurements as a reference as well! Shipping is fast."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Only 4 stars as it was my 1st ever order, arrived quick, item lovely,i just hope i can add that extra star after ordering a few more times n it all goes as smooth....have now updated to 5 stars🙂 iv ordered quite a few items now and all i can say is wow!!!! For the price i paid everything was great, no cheap tacky material, no hanging thread, the sizes were all true to size. Will deffo be getting my clothes from shein in future 🙂🙂"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Fast delivery and good quality
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's good I can finally can finally have nice petite clothes as it's really hard find things that fit me in normal stores (even XS are usually too big). Some teen clothes are cool and not cartonish do I got a lot of them for myself too. One thing I'll add would be the option to save and show all of our body measurements so we can easily compare our measurements with the clothes I'm looking at
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very helpful, has almost anything clothing wise and isn't overpriced like most stores. Shipping is quite low. Products have useful information unlike other online stores and you can see photos of people with the products and reviews. Overall, very well done and even though I still haven't purchased anything yet you have a wish lost and can create boards as well as people can see your acc and boards if they aren't private."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is super easy to use. They offer points as store credit which is awesome. Also they are always offering coupons/ discounts so you never have to pay full price. Shipping is included too! Love their products. Some of their items are definitely PG13 or R rated lol so if you're young maybe shop elsewhere, but lots of great options for ladies in relationships ;) and in general for everyday wear. I shop on here for legit everything"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Probably one of the best shopping sites/apps I've ever used. Huge selection in tons of different styles so there's something for anyone. The low prices were what lead me to download and that can sometimes lead to cheap quality, but returns are also very simple. Would definitely recommend for fashion lovers on a budget."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein has a wonderful and fabulous collection of clothing. Their quality is too good. If u don't like anything they are very quick in refund and picking delivery. I have been ordering from past 2 years....i love everything about shein. Their cuts, style, material is just excellent. Their size is also perfect. Their accessories are to die for. It's my most favourite online shopping. I spend atleast an hour every day on their site. They give you points on every review whether good or bad. Love you"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Awesome styles at super affordable prices. Most clothing is true to size with a few exceptions which are always stated in reviews. My biggest advice is to DEFINITLEY READ THE REVIEWS before ordering! Shipping is sometimes free & it ships faster than I imagined. You can earn points that go towards discounts on future orders by purchasing items, writing reviews, or just by checking into the app daily amoung other things. I absolutely LOVE SHEIN!!!🖤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Love the variety and the pricing of the items. Everything arrives in good time and items are packaged well. Only downfall is the sizing of baby clothes. Would be very helpful to have the age group (such as 0-3 months) rather than the current sizing guide.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love Shein and it's clothes. I shop at least 4 to 5 times a month with Shein and how I am able to do so is because their prices are so reasonable. My problem is there prices keep you coming back for your wardrobe to keep expanding. I have so many choices to choose from when I have an event or church service. It never was like that before Shein. Thank you Shein for considering us that can shop on a budget but yet get good quality clothes at reasonable prices.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,You guys have a urgent delivery button When ever I try to press it its not working And what's the point of having Buffalo number on the app if you can't get hold of it
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Amazing!! It feeds my window shopping desires and is almost better than pinterest for outfit ideas too. Always read the reviews!!! That way you know what to expect when you order for sizing and the quality of the item. I've ordered everything from workout clothes to gala style dresses and have rarely been disappointed. Its like any online ordering, the size or fit won't be perfect 100% of the time. Please update the review options so I can review item one at a time instead of an entire order :)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The App itself is easy to navigate and I love the ease of ordering and the speed of delivery as well as the easy tracking system. I live in Australia and have received both my orders within 2 weeks. I appreciate the coupons, the notifications of sale and would love if the sizes are standardised as I have to read through 30 or so reviews to ensure that the size I order will fit me. I have 2 dresses that I should have sized down. It would be good to include Australian size charts for comparison."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shein is a great online shopping place! It has cute clothes for all shapes and sizes which is amazing! It can be a little pricey sometimes but thats easy to avoid. Another little flaw is the constant Emails, but once again thats easy to avoid. All in all a great clothing brand and would recommend shopping here."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I really don't know what is up with the coupons on shein now but the app has definitely changed to worse... You have coupons but it applies to none of the items in your basket... I don't know but this really feels like a big scam. They are far gone the days when shein used to make us dream with their good deals 😩🚮
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. It's so easy to navigate and when you put something in your basket it automatically shows you similar options. There is so much variety. The quality is usually good, but the best thing is that its cheap enough to buy something you might only wear a couple of times. The only downfall is I spend too much money here with at least one order per month!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Pro...the clothes are super cute and affordable. They arrived fast and were exactly how they looked in the pictures. Con...I sincerely hope you like what you purchase and the size because you will be stuck with it. The customer service is THE worst I have ever experienced, no lie. Their FAQs are on a loop, and you are getting just more and more frustrated by the button pushing instead of a live person who actually wants to help you! Buyer beware!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Generally SHEIN Fashion products are superb in terms of quality and designs that is why I !aaeep on ordering online. What makes my rating lower with only 3⭐s were my bad experiences with your contracted delivery courier. At least 2 batches of my orders were returned to supplier last year due to NOT PROPERLY communicated notices before the actual delivery.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is 100% legit! I have received 3 successfully shipments within 2 weeks of placing each order. I have posted reviews with pictures. So far have not had a single issues with shipping, sizing, correct orders. Keep your side of the commitment and it seems Shein keeps theirs! Absolutely love the clothes I have received! I have over 40 new outfit combinations and have spent less than 200$ total. Seriously, worth it. 100%!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I purchased 23 items in one order, everything i purchased was MAGNIFICENT!!,🤩 I was scared to purchase items being they where coming from cross seas , quality is usually poor!! But let me tell you what GOOD QUALITY!! EVERY ITEM!!!! The items came between 3 to 5 days not bad.i usually wear a large but i got an Extra large and i didnt even have to. The Best $200 i spent"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great designs, great prices, some materials in particular in white are a little on the thin side but can't fault any others, quality pretty good for the price. Bought lots of long dresses (5.7ft) and the length is great. Would definitely buy again. Most sizes are true to size but if you prefer slightly looser fit, go up one."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"App copies from clipboard automatically. Not sure where my last review went. Regardless of the developers' intent when copying the clipboard, this is a privacy breach and should be fixed. There was a huge issue with this when iOS and Android first introduced notifications about clipboard access. The practice is disingenuous at best, and the developers know this very well. I would recommend clearing your clipboard before using the app or uninstalling it entirely."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have had a complaint open for 3+ months and they really don't do much. I've had things delivered broken. I've had orders with things missing. I am considering not being a customer because it is just so appauling Yes I have gone to customer services and they have had this open for 3+ months (as said above) and they do barely anything. So yes I've tried it but would not recommend it
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"My experience with shein is preety good, i would recommend to buy everything except cosmetics from shein. Also a suggestion if shein could reduce their delivery time, because many times if we need something in a week or so than also we need to buy through other online stores, whereas Shein is much Reasonable in price and good in quality. Request u to reduce the delivery time. Else all is good ☺️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They let you earn points for checking in daily, but the points expire so quickly that you can only accumulate about $2.60 before they start to disappear from your total. And there's a pretty low cap on how many you're allowed to use in one purchase. Completely unfair."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm happy. But don't expect quality products at a cheap page but whatever you wished for pom poms for high heels, rain cover for backpack, Russian hat, sexy leggings looking like went to gym, ipad case. there's everything!!!! You will find it for a nice price. Customer service is also helpful 99.9% if not try again with another person but actually they were nice to me. It's not a scam! Just read the description before buying stuff and measure pls but shoes didn't work for me. Too bad information"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Bad experience. My order was delayed. I paid already. Never order again. FYI, this was my firts time to order. I've already ordered last week. Expected that my parcel should be delivered on 12/15 -12/17 but how can I have it if you haven't shipped it yet? This is unacceptable and never order again. It takes forever for you to ship the parcel. I just want my money back!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,They have an amazing selection of clothing and so much more! The prices are soo affordable. The app is super easy to use. I love having a wishlist section for storing things i want to buy later! The quality of everything I've purchased is fabulous. Everything seems to be true to size
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely love shein. Honestly has the best range of plus size clothing I've ever come across. And for such amazing prices!! The app is very easy to use, no issues at all. It's always easy to access customer services and returns as well as tracking. I love it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app the clothes are great. Have ordered from it a couple times. my latest order was perfect so nothing needing sending back. on my first ever order I needed to send a couple bits back because it didn't suit me no other reason, returning it wasn't difficult but you do have to pay a fee to return it. other than that I think shein is fantastic!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I don't know why but I'm losing points more than gaining. What the heck. Also the point redemption goes from 1-22 to a flat 1 point everyday. The heckkk
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The selection is endless. Many different topics to choose from on the app. Styles are Creative but quality is lacking. The odds and end great but Out of all the clothes I have purchased they have been see through, cheap and not fitting properly.( yes I check the sizing chart) I keep trying to buy things in hope and have a cart full just hesitant to purchase because I dont want to waste more money. Optomistic but hesitant. Other friends have found good things though."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Definitely have been ordering from shein for a while and they never disappoint, you do need to be careful with the clothes because the size aren't exactly correct but I just compare my body to the models so I can have a more exact fit other then that I love there products and so far they have no disappointed me, i do most of my Christmas shopping there !"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Love the clothes. The images can be misleading but if you pay attention you'll only get the quality yoy expect. Worst thing about this website is that they'll DRASTICALLY alter the """"original"" price to make the discount seem better than it is (ex: i've been eyeing a sweatshirt waiting for it to drop in price on black friday/cyber monday. look back today, it now costs more than it usually does and the ""'original"""" price jumped from $25 to $51. ridiculous 🙄👎)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's really good apps that you can order things online that you need or want and also when you wanted to be more fashionable about what's the trendy goin on now adays it's all here actually that you can find on SHEIN. It's my 3rd times I purchased on their site using their application and I already spent almost 3k Qatar riyals. Anyways two of my orders wasn't correct the necklace is broken and the ring holder aren't right in quantity.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Absolutely LOVE this app! I'm addicted now. Was a bit sceptical at first as I wasn't sure about the sizes and delivery times but they have a very accurate sizing charts and customer reviews that help a lot when choosing the right size. Quality of items is incredibly and delivery times are pretty fast too. Love all the promotions that the app offers all the time also. Can't wait for my latest orders! 🙇‍♀️
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app was...sub-par, at best. It doesn't have very interesting items, and its sections pander a lot to societal gender ""norms"". ""Men don't wear dresses,"" and ""women should be skinny"" - you know, all the really bad stuff. The prices are also somewhat high on some of the items that really don't deserve such high pricing, and it's difficult to find what you're looking for. Very visually unappealing, too. I don't recommend this app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is amazing. When I first got shein I thought it might not be what I actually ordered, but it was and it was perfect. I am using shein to come out of my comfort zone with clothes. I used to wear all baggy clothes and now I wear cute clothes. The prices are crazy cheap the flash sale ends quick but the prices are so great. I ordered from shein and got a bathing suit for less than $10. My most recent order I got cheap jewlery, 2 shirts, and a dress I cannot wait until that comes in."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My experience with this app is absolutely great. They have many different styles and add new pieces everyday. I definitely recommend this app if you love cheap, trendy yet good quality clothing. I recommend getting the two-piece butterfly outfit for less than $10.00."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Dont buy anything from this ridiculous app. Material is very cheap. Waste of money. Regret shopping here. They took 3 weeks to deliver my order and i was very disappointed after receiving the product. Plus i have to pay for delivery and pick-up even if its shein's problem because cloth is not at all same as shown in the picture hence you people are cheats!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing. Just, amazing! I bought some cute new clothing for the summer, and I'm updating my wardrobe bit by bit. Things get expensive, fast. 4 shirts and maybe a necklace add up to like 20$ with tax and shipping, but the clothes have great quality and fit perfectly. I'm not complaining! ✨"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall good, read the measurements and order on those instead of size. Orders are usually dilivered earlier than expected. Returns are a little confusing. You can return multiple things from an order one time for free but if you have to return something later there is a charge."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So far so good! I've only ordered once so far, I really appreciate the navigation within the app. And shipping was way faster then indicated! In ordering, the customer reviews have been MOST HELPFUL!!! So as with anything, proceed with caution, do your research, and pray about it before you make your selections to purchase. They offer excellent pricing for their merchandise, and I'm quite pleased with my informed purchases."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love shein. Prices are REALLY GOOD, AND products are good quality as well. I've only had to return some things because I got the wrong size, and their return process is easy as well. I do however wish it didn't take so long to get my orders tho. Most of the time it takes over 2wks sometimes over 3wks. But all in all it's one of my fave places to shop 😍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have been ordering different items from Shein for 5 months now and I must say that some were mostly satisfactory and has great quality. But you have to manage your expectations at times because not everything you see on Shein is what you get. Some clothings I ordered has really thin cloth. And almost all white dresses and tops were see-through. The sandals I have bought there have also worn off even though I only used it twice. Hopefully, Shein will sell products with greater quality soon!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I have had to return 2 dresses in 2 orders, ( the only orders I ever places). I feel the dress sizes were wrong on both occasion and the material should be considered when sizing. I ordered a few household items as well including the transparent tape for covering sink/ gas sides and gas cover. Tape is working well. Will appreciate a longer roll as mine was a quarter length short on the sink and haven't used it for gas as yet. And do not like the gas cover/ protector as material is thin & porous."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The first time I ordered from them I never got my order it took a while but I was able to contact them and they sent me all of my new products free from charge I love how they provide the clothes almost exactly like the picture the only problem with the texture of some of them was from my end I DO RECOMMEND LOOKING AT THE REVIEWS they are so helpful!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It was ok because the clothes are not expensive. The details sometimes on the model is different like the color or how long it is. Even the design can be not really the same. I like the clothes I ordered. I ordered 11 things I keeped 6 of the clothing. The rest I returned I wanted to keep 2 of the ones I returned but the size was smaller then what I ordered I need then to be longer I guess so I returned then I'll order a size up next time on those.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,All though the clothes are very affordable and super cute! This is a really bad brand. All of their clothes are fast fashion which is very bad for the environment. But that's really all thats bad about them. I mean the app and site is fine and the clothes are cheap and cute and may be great. This is fast fashion and very bad for the environment.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love this app but I have a big problem...it takes so sooooo long to get anything I order. I can go on Amazon find the same outfit for cheaper and get it here faster... It takes a 1 to 3 months just for me to get my items. Yeah yall might have cute stuff but yalls delivery system has to be what makes this app not worth it. If your someone who doesn't mine waiting, then download it. But my package sat at one place for 2 weeks and when I try to call shein, it's worthless bad app..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I was trying to download something else and instead of having the specific thing I searched for at the top for some reason Google thought it was necessary to put this at the top under a label called ""sponsor"" . So leaving a bad review since they tricked me into clicking this first. Btw I didn't even use it. Hope your happy. Hope it was worth it to intrude on my time because you don't know how to post a simple ad instead of intruding like that. Maybe you'll learn from this not to be so ignorant."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Haven't received my first order yet so can't rate the products one thing I did note because I found it extremely annoying, I looked at many many many different products and not once did a blurb give a description of the material used. I like to know if I'm buying cotton, nylon or polyester etc. Once I found the wishlist and filter functions operating the site was much easier. So many beautiful options even for plus size women not a single ugly granny mum in site 😁"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely love Shein! We have a rather large Family, which can be very expensive when it comes to clothing & decor. Shein has given our Family more financial freedom & incredible organization with their low prices. As an added benefit, our family & home stays unique, yet stylish. Regardless of what, when or how much has been ordered, they have never messed up a single item on our orders. That alone is impressive!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"very good much better than expected I went two sizes up with the clothes and they fit just fine good quality too. I bought a plain t shirt and a bikini to try it out and I love them both. couldn't give 5 star as shopping is a little expensive and slow ,however it is coming from China or somewhere so don't mind waiting. website good and easy to use"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein😍😍😅,the app itself it very easy to use, it also have tons of discounts,it affordable,it is updated with the latest fashion,when you place an order and you always up to date regarding your shipment,Shein got friendly consultants,you can ask them about almost anything you want,and they sizes are exact the one your ordered,I recommend to everyone to try it❣️💯👌"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"great app for the ones who love being stylish all the time , the quality of the material is always good and the fashion is all new and trending , the best part is the shein points and the contets being organised by shein from time to time that helps its customers stay stylish and a step ahead in the latest trend . The offers are always exciting and the price of the products are reasonable . I would recommend the app to everone ."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I Absolutely Love Shein! They have the most reasonable prices & even cheaper during their sales & even give more discounts & coupons for just about all amounts of orders & the prices being so cheap but the prices don't refect the quality of clothing! I find The quality of the bathing suites & clothing aren't even a 3rd of the prices that I pay for any clothing from VS for less quality don't have to buy pieces separately and I was so surprised of the quality when I first started buying Shein!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Shein is a great place to find clothes and accessories for an amazing price but unfortunately I am on the bigger size of the scale. I understand that you pay a little more for bigger clothes but there are not many cute ones to choose from for the price that the little ones are. I wish that you had a section for bigger girls to choose cuter clothes from.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Such a huge range of clothing, I shop plus size and there's so much to choose from. Delivery is pretty good considering it's international, and the prices are affordable or you can go more expensive if you wish. You can also bank up points by checking in every day, and can use them at checkout. I always get comments on my purchases, thanks Shein"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This was our first time ordering from Shein and I was very happy with all of our purchases. I paid for the faster shipping and had my whole order here in less than a week. The app is well made, easy to navigate and shop on. The clothing quality was good too. They have a wide variety to choose from. Overall very happy with the whole experience."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Extremely disappointed with the service that they provide. Products are good no doubt i used to order frequently from shein and i rated it 5 stars but this i placed my order on 18 may and till now i haven't received it. I tried calling to customer service and courier service many times but they just say order will be delivered on high priority but i haven't received it yet and there is no tracking update on app as well. No value of customer's time, it's been more then a month now."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,What I ordered is the exact thing shein will deliver. I always enjoy my order an the good thing also about shein is that once u don't like any of your items u can always return it an get back your refund. Shein is just the perfect place for shopping. I love shein an encourage each an every one to shop with shein for you will never be disappointed with what ever you item you buy from shein and the more you buy from shein the more discount points an voucher you get to enable you buy more.❤️❤️❤️❤️
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Pleasantly surprised at the quality of the products. I assumed that with the prices being so low that the products would be low quality, however I was wrong! Every item I have purchased (over 200 items) have been high quality! I highly recommend Shein! I will absolutely continue to shop here, I LOVE Shein!! 5☆++++++"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I think it's bit odd that there are five second ads (like the ones you'd get for a YouTube video) that pop up when you first open the app and it won't let you skip or access the actual app itself until your eyes have seared their sales image into your mind, forever fortifying the idea that you are an information sponge and they can download whatever thought, concept, or fashion forward propaganda that their company focused advertisment so desires---a perpetual loop of buy culture. Very odd. 4/5"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Take it from me! Okay so I've been shopping now with shien for past two months. Always seeing the sites offers, deals, etc. And countless of friend's who shop with Shein & give nothing but great feedback. So I started with a prepaid card to make sure it was all legit, haven't had any fraud on the card, and all deliveries I have made, regular shipping or express. Everytime I have received my items before expecting dates. Can we just say how affordable everything is? Quality is amazing!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I personally love evrything its a great apps so far so good i can order my item and it arrived safetly without any issues. Its a secure app. Shein is the best . My only issues isthat most of the materials for clothing is with polyester but apart from that part its all good. Just before checking out make sure you check on all your item your description just to avoid any dissapointments.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's similar to Wish and Temu. I did a test run because I read that they list one price but after it is paid for you see they charged you for a different price. I encountered this but I believe that on the receipt it gives after payment shows the price paid plus the tax charged instead of breaking it down by price, then tax, then grand total. All in all, I prefer Temu. Easier to navigate and find what I want."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Fast delivery but paid return. If you compare to equivalent western platform you'll love how fast they deliver and reviews are so honest and transparent that you don't get bad surprise when you receive your products. But other apps let you return your items for free and easily in a 7/El**** or else. While with SHEIN you need to go to the post office and pay the shipment to return the goods. Granted that the return address is local and not too expensive but it's still way less convenient on that
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have been using this app to purchase my clothes&accessories up to date,honestly it has uncountable good deals are good quality & value for money. Accept for some sellers, they advertised one,upon delivery is another!So the best is buyers carefully read the product descriptions and screenshot for quality assurance purpose.The chat team are very responsive. Delivery is up to marks.Upon wrong product description sold/received,u can return with minimal charge. So it a great app to do shopping."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Have purchased a fair bit from shein and love it. I learnt early on quality is hit and miss but also learnt to read other buyers reviews. I just discovered the loyalty program and have had a couple of free items now. Also just bought baby boy clothes and am so happy with quality and price, and variety is better than what you get in store. I haven't had to return anything yet so can't comment on that process."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I personally enjoyed every bit of shopping, highly recommended this site, but sometimes i got disappointed because of some stuff and there material is very thin & transparent like some leggings.. so dear viewer before u buy products, see the comment's n size's.. over all amazing site.. one thing more refund takes lots of time, its little frustrates.. fast delivery that what i like in shein.. i return some items n i got refund, but thing is that i can't find them not in wallet, nor in gift card."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"very very disappointing app. Guys, Shein uses 100% polyester material for manufacturing the products which is so unhealthy and not eco-friendly at all. I checked the compostion of so many items displayed on the app and every single item (of those I checked) has composition of 100% polyester. I feel so bad. Uninstalled this useless app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am personally not a fan of online shopping , but liked the collection offered by Shein. However it's been an eternity since I placed the order , and the shipment is still in transit. Their customer service is practically non-existent. The autobot chat doesn't help at all. If you want to test your patience and want clothes for the next season , place the order now. This rating is only based on my experience so far with the delivery. Hoping it gets delivered by next winter."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Eventho I have gotten some good clothes, most have been cheap looking. Not at all what was pictured. One extreme disappointment was when I ordered a linen shirt, I was sent the right pattern and color but was made of cheap synthetic material. Also your size guide and what is sent are not comparable. I cannot recommend your products at this time."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good quality actually, delivery is fast as well, about week or two maximum. If some goods come law quality, they always give refund and reward with some points, even sometimes you even don't have a return the item, if it's damaged. Support is very fast, even in covid times. P.s:I noticed same item of scarf different colors was written one from polyester and another color of 100 silk,support said it's a mistake and corrected it, but still too big mistake, be ware of mentioned Material."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love how easy to use shein. I love how the items have sizes and details provided for the customers. The ""confirm delivery"" button seems clickable. I don't know if it is clickable but I hope it isn't. It's kind of stressful whenever I see it and it is near with ""track"" button which I usually check. I don't want to accidentally click it. I suggest to make it unclickable and to make it look like unclickable too."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Quality is incredible, the different types of fashion they sell is awesome. Styles fit everyone. Cute bathroom accessories and also for bedrooms. The cost of some things are nice and not too expensive. I would definitely recommend for everyone to check it out. I love some of the vintage type clothing they sell it's so cute. I also got my cats harnesses and they love them and they are cute too boot."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Absolutely fantastic the first time I ordered I got some jumpers and a pair of boots they were fantastic quality and they wash really well. Last week I received my second order and I was over the moon with my purchase I ordered 2 dresses and a shorts jump suit and the jump suit is absolutely gorgeous.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely love shein!However, Im kinda sick over the price rising and how the Canadian shein cost 40-85%+ more than the US shein AFTER the exchange rate!The US shein has better sales and discounts. Ex: Canada gets buy 2 get 1 free and the US has buy 1 get 1 free plus the exact same items after the exchange rate is usually around 50% cheaper than the Canadian site. UNFAIR! I have the ability to shop on both but I would prefer to ship to Canada but I cant because they're ripping Canadians off!😠"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I will never use or reffer this app to anyone ever , i have been waiting for months with less than no updates on where my shipping is . They also say shipping is free if you buy over a certain amount , but not once said anything about nit being able to collect yoir package if you dont pay the courier a tax amount if not payed within a month they destroy your oders so you are basically left with no choice but to pay. I have knew about this prior i wouldnt have used the app. Absolutely frustrated"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I really love shopping at shein the clothing is always so comfy and stylish and normally the shipping is really good never had a problem with it. Would love if they had more cases for a variety of phones seeing as can't order a phone case for my phone.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is a one stop online shop for so much, and so inexpensive! Many times the shipping is free (when you order over $29 or free for any amount on Sundays) and I have never had a problem with receiving my orders. I have ordered dozens of times thus far. They have a daily ""check in"" point system where you can log into the app daily and receive points for $ off your purchase, as well as points for reviewing your purchases and receiving your delivery. I definitely recommend!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Absolutely love shein! Very affordable (especially during these hard times) what you see is what you get! The sizes are spot on. Honestly I have never felt like i needed or wanted to return anything. I have Absolutely loved everything I have purchased!!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love this app and it has such a wide selection of things but there is one thing that I really need them to have: acrylic powder. I've been looking everywhere for these but they are sooo expensive so if SHEIN makes it but cheap it would save my life!! Anyway I do recommend this u can get ALMOST everything for like 10 times cheaper
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best shopping app ever. I've ordered nearly 100 clothing items from SHEIN. The only couple times I wasn't satisfied were my own fault, bc I didn't read the description ( which is never tricky or misleading) or the reviews and got something I should've sized up or down on. Shipping time isn't that bad either, usually 2 weeks, READ THE REVIEWS, which come with photos & alotta time a very good description bc buyers get points for a review & more points if other buyers give it a 👍 for beinghelpful"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"My shopping experience has been somewhat positive. I'd give 5*, but Shein needs to change the policy and quality of some of the products and stop the no return of bodysuits. What's that all about? And way too many adverts and recommendations that are not even in my size range. App is easy enough to use but a bit too much navigating here n there. when reviewing, if they don't like your wording, the reviews don't get posted so no bonus points."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shein sells a huge variety of clothing styles, including some decent modest items. Quality is good on most items of clothing too but avoid the jewelery as it's quite poor quality and has turned our skin green. Delivery hasn't been a problem either so far and we've ordered about 4 times from the website. The discounts are also pretty decent."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's great but when it's comes to combination I can't go for that and they always have nice combination wears... But the size are way too complicated, let me say I wear M for pants, while L or XL for shirt, with combination I can't get it like that.... Everything must be the same. You guys should create a different section for the trousers and shirt sizes so we could make a better choice when it comes to that part (Combination) Thank you 👌👌"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love this site!!!! Best customer experience ever with an online order. I ordered for the first time 2 years ago, couldn't fit the 2 ite.s, tried to return them and Shein said to keep them as a gift & still gave me a REFUND!!!!! repeat customer for ever!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely love SHEIN! I just got my first order from them (which did not take long at all for shipment), and absolutely every item that I have bought from them came exactly what it look like in the picture I swear I will never buy from another website again, unless it's just like this one, I'll be purchasing a second order very soon! Thanks SHEIN :)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing and I have been using it for months now! This is so much better than shops like PLT and ASOS. If you're looking for low prices, coupon codes, opportunities, Free Trials and beautiful clothes, Shein is for you! I have purchased many times and all my items arrive within a week to 10 days and I'm always satisfied with my purchases. The Customer Service is great! They also do live streams where you can recieve points to use at checkout (and in games inside the app). So download!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Wow this app is great, not only does it have things for kids like school supplies and stationary but it also has plus size clothing as well, not much for shoes above 10 but the clothes are amazing and good quailty but wait there's more, they even have home decor, bedding and sheets, kitchen utinsils and LED lights strips. Really this app is everything in one for almost all things you'll be looking for. Yes truly awsome..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very stylish clothes and so far,I have not experienced problems with delivery. The threshold for free delivery is fairly good in comparison to other companies. However, I find it difficult to find and apply coupons at checkout."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it's an amazing app, not just the variety of the clothes is amazing but the quality too. also if we have to return our clothes it's way too easy, and on the very next day a man arrived to pick them up! do download it if u r interested in making your wardrobe updated all the time❤ tysm shein❤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The quality oficial the ítems are excellent. The departure is very quickly, Arrives sooner that the date says. The only thing Is that customer service is not good. They don't answer your important questions about status of orders and also the note that is added in the order I mean the status is never correct. Example; your order is delivered and is not. Or your order will be delivered and then in DSL says that the information is not correct. I have been in the phone hours speaking with both"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,#shein I'm disappointed in yall!!!!! Day after day I get notifications for this and that just like today with the notification saying fall styles under 9.99 there's not a plus size anywhere on that list. There's never a plus size on your deals. And that's not fair to anybody over a size 12 or xl. I don't know if I'll ever order clothes from yall because yall don't include plus size in your daily deals and what not. Fix this and I'll gladly rate it 5 stars
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's hit n miss but if you don't purchase the cheaper you don't return as much. Also Romwe is affiliated and my favorite skirt is from Romwe and it was only 11 buck. The site always gives you discounts and almost always free shipping. There's a secret I now know and it's ordering plus size because there sizes run small so there xl or plus size isn't and there's slot of discounts of around 50% I like not having to buy my clothes at Amazon because there really not that cheap. Cs is ok.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely LOVE SHEIN!! I've ordered from this app a bunch, and overall have been super happy with my purchases! If you read the reviews on each product, they won't steer you wrong. I love that you can earn points for leaving honest reviews and use the points to take money off of your future purchases. Every order I've placed has come before the expected delivery date which is great too. Highly recommend, especially if you're a baddie on a budget and want fashionable, affordable clothing!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love the app love the produce. The only thing I'd say about shopping is you need a high to low price filter. Brilliant idea about letting us leave reviews but please please make it so we don't need to spend a percentage to use our winnings. I'd love to see more UK electronics and gadgets and toys as weel
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is my favorite app to shop on and has been for such a long time. I forget to check in but I am on there atleast a couple times daily. Its a great app. Shipping time, prices, variety offered, games in the app often that are fun, plus this app offers many many other ways to gain points too. Excellent prices, clothes fit me well and they have great customer service too. Thanks Shein"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have just received my 2nd order.... and I am in the process of selecting items for my 3rd order. I cannot say one negative thing about SHEIN's service and very prompt delivery.

Edit: Shien is really weird and sketchy, I will not be using it anymore."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely love the Shein app/website. Very informative and i just love the variety. My favourite place to shop. I even started my small business selling Shein clothing in South Africa. Pricing is reasonable and quality is great👌 Gave this app 5 stars before until i had some issues and needed help. No one to communicate with, nobody replies to your queries. So 5 stars to order and get stock. 0 stars for after sales support and queries. Been unable to place an order for the last week 👎👎👎"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I ordered a white hair topper. What I got was a brassy topper worn a big splotch of black on the front. I contacted the company, &they said they looked at the picture I sent them and it was the piece I ordered. I've asked them SEVERAL times to show me the picture of the white topper I ordered and they've yet to do it. They have offered me a $10 credit & it would cost ME too much to return it.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is a fabulous App and shopping experience. Easy to use, very quick shipping (even though it says 10 - 12 days. I have always received parcels within 7 days. Mostly arrives in 2 separate ones. But I have no problem with that. Daily updates to where parcel is, plus a very accurate time of personal delivery. They check if you've received it, and if you missed it, to check with your neighbours. VERY efficient. And last but by no means least,product as described and good quality for low prices"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"First time shopping on this app and I'm surprised people aren't getting scammed unlike on other apps. Theres also legit ratings and reviews on clothes that aren't bots, people can take pictures of the clothes they bought and it really helps because you can not only see that it's a legit buyer but you can also see how it fits the other person and get a image of what you're expecting in the mail! ❤️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is the best of all the online shop for clothing I have ever used. They have trendy clothes with reasonable price. I also like that I dont need to pay a bunch of delivery fees for every product I add to cart because they are delivered in 1 shipment. The best one is their customer service! They will really resolve your issue as long as its not fraudulent! I love this app!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Shein is one of my favorite apps to shop from. I shop from it mainly for junk Journaling supplies and they have not disappointed me so far. They update the categories frequently with new items. The only thing I don't like ATM Is I can't view people pictures in full on their reviews it's not my phone as my phone is new but other than that I love it. I don't mind the randomness of items and I haven't got doubles so far If i order 2 of the same product with different options. Love it.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love Shein Clothes 💖 especially their Gown and Formal Dinner Dresses it fits me well its accurate especially the design & colour. What they post in the picture is the same when your order arrive. Highly recommended that you buy clothes here. There's a lot to choose from in any occasion. And the delivery is fast. I will always order clothes here.💖💖💖
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Made 3 orders since December. Everything was as described. 2 orders came earlier than expected. Had to cancel some items and the refund was processed very quickly. The only problem now is its costing me a fortune with all these orders!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Order never came, just sat in the state north of me for a week and then was returned so all my Halloween costume stuff is just completely gone and I waited this whole time until the last second now to find out. Waste of time and money and hope. Rarely am I this disappointed. Edit: contacted customer service before this review was posted. My second shipment (minus the critical item that made me shop here in the first place fsr) and this shipment has done the same thing. Shoppers beware."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"the prices are very cheap and the items look like they are in good shape and they are good guality. I just ordered my first item yesterday and i cant wait to try it on. My only thing is that there aren't that many plus size clothing for women, the selection is big but not as big as the regular size, but other than that it's a wonderful app"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So cute in app and online everything is affordable I'd say sizing is either 2 sizes too big or 2 sizes too small so stick to your size and NOT measurements on the app. They offer points every single day for check in, your able to win 3 freebies every week if you are able to lol I've never won but its coming. Shipping is always faster then 2 weeks or 14 days exactly."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great price and products. I love this app. My only advice for the improvement and development of this app would be to make it so that customers can update their reviews and also be able organize their wishlists into groups . This would make it so much easier to find what you want and to add to the basket . I'd like to be able to make a couple of wish lists for friends. other than that I'm very pleased with it (hope I'm not tempting fate LoL!) 😊👍
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love Shein!! I'm so obsessed with all the low prices especially the discount coupons AND the points that Shein gives out when u login and order every time you are done checking out because those points add up to money... Example: 1 point adds up to $.1 cent 100points adds up to $1.00 dollar NOW YOU SEE WHY I LOVE AND AM OBSESSED WITH THIS APP POINTS = FREE STUFF EVERY TIME 😊
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My #1 place to shop!! I'm literally addicted to shopping Shein, they have everything from clothes of all kinds and sizes, swimsuits, underwear, lingerie, accessories, shoes, jewelry, home decor, bedding, electronics & so much more! The app is so easy and fun to use as well and love receiving coupons and discounts !"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I do like most of my clothes as I have to return at least 2 out of 5 .Customers should be able to return as many returns in one package than being deducted a 7.95 fee for each order returned. This is reason I don't order anymore.i was constantly seeing something new every day and when I had to return I couldn't combine orders and return everything and be charge one deductible. So I go to Amazon or the stores. I hope this goes to consideration I know this applies to many customers
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,So far I'm enjoying the app very user friendly. I made my 1st purchases and very excited to see the goods There wasn't once that I felt disappointed in my purchase..the measure guide is super helpful in making the right size choice I find the delivery service very professional and on top of their game
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The clothes on here are so size inclusive at the best prices!! It's know as not the most ethical place to shop, but when nowhere else sells your sizes at the standard shein does, kinda left with no choice and I love it! It pretty much has everything from clothes to home decorations and it's all do beautiful!! 10/10 would recommend. Discount codes are available also!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Reasonable prices. Not all you see is always perfect but in this app store, as long as you read reviews from other customers which most are honest, you will get exactly you are looking for. Shein's styles are so unique and i like most of all that i ordered. 4 star coz men's are pricey in here! Love to buy some for my hubby but very rare affordable on my pocket.... great products still!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,My experience with shein was good until my card expired and I renewed it and then I couldn't order again. It keep saying payment error and there isnt anywhere to add the new card. Where I normally put the card information that's where I added it and still saying error. I check with my bank they sa yv no problems with the card and I use my cards other 0paces and it works 🤦‍♀️
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like that Oxford style, it remind me of when I was in elementary school. I like the way the shoe is made. I can fit that size that's available. That's not the cheaper looking one that can't make a bow. To my understanding I like being comfortable more than anything. I can grab my book and study, I can look up complicated words without being uncomfortable, I can turn pages without ripping them. That shoe will help me with standing firmly. I like them for the feel not learning about discomfort."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Points deduction Everything about this app is great but the point get deducted really fast, i dont even have enough time to use it. Plus the free trial is NOT TRUE AT ALL I've been applying for it for years and never got anything."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"SheIn is lots of fun! I love it! I don't like to commit to 100 dollar outfits and would rather wear a 20 dollar outfit 6 times and move on. If this seems wasteful to you and you like to wear the highest quality clothing then I would either recommend the MOTF SheIn brand which is more silk and good quality cotton, etc., or shop elsewhere. SheIn returns are free and easy and that cinches the deal for me too."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Why can't you just click on one button to get to reporting a problem without having to navigate here there and everywhere. So far my clothing purchases have been excellent quality. Often arrives in the UK in 6 days. The biggest extremely annoying issue is that many of the female models pose in a very suggestive way, in this day and age it demeans women. Is there any way to add to the app the ability to review your feedback and amend it incase of any future unforseen problems with the item"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app. Great quality clothes. Have order many times and very impressed. Inexpensive yet gorgeous pieces. Also home decor is amazing for lighting and ornaments. They have the cheapest phone cases around, so pretty and excellent quality. Only thing is would like if they made phone cases for huawei phones also as they are only available for iPhones 💜"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really love this app for the reasonably cheap prices and fast delivery , but the costomer service is wack. My first order was like 8 items i recived 1 dress out of all the other items and a pants which was a wrong order , it say delivered i tried to contack costomer service about my order they keep telling me it was delivered check with ups. It was delivered but wrong package that has my name on it so frostrating."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is really great as it offers variety of things that is needed. But there should be an online customer support as everyone knows about corona outbreak soo i needed a clear answer from the customer support about the safety as it is really a serious issue to talk on and have a guarantee that after being shipped it arrives without the virus ,even though it refers that the package is been sanitized but through the shipping days of 10 -12 it can be infected and the danger arises."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"My experience with Shein was very nice bcz whatever (accessories) I've purchased till now were all really awsome.. I wasn't deceived, I really got what was shown in the pictures... But the logistis service was really poor, my consignment was split into two, so I received one of my products within 2-3 day but all of my other products came after 2 weeks, and during this period you cant even contact anyone,, I would've definitely given 5 stars if the logistics service was better..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"i luv the app! it gives rewards, discounts, and free shipping. it's very easy to use as long as the app is updated. i just wish that some items are more cheaper than the way they are like for example a tube croptop worth ₱300+ is too high if they can make it less than or equal to ₱100+ then that can be more suitable. also, the shipping is very smooth it took for my items to arrived for only 2-3 days lol that's all thanks."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing and reliable app .I've had a great experience till now .Stylish and good quality products. The delivery is a bit slow though, took 7days but it's ok .Also the return policy is good though you have to pay return fee. At first i was reluctant to buy things online but shein greatly improved my experience .Nice app but need improvement in customer service ."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This is a very manipulative app. They fool your money in different ways. Beware of there shipping charges & discount codes. I ordered above $50 and was charged $4 shipping fee because i used there discount code that dropped me just below $50. And now when i return the products i am paying $10 for a $6 slippers that i kept. They also don't return jewellery and some apparels too. Be very careful. Also, the quality of their products has deteriorated alot. I short they may fool you for your amount!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,There customer service is very poor. I have been trying to contact them for many days but they don't answer calls. My order got shipped to other address even after changing my address . And due to corona I can't collect that order at that address. I asked delivery boy to cancel it or deliver to my home address but he refused to do so. I think he just cancelled that order. I don't know what will happen to that order now. Either they should deliver it to my home address or refund the whole amount
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Not possible to delete account as they link you to the wrong options and eventually say that you are log in the wrong account. Customer service is not existing, only robo chat available with the same answers over and over again and no actual help. Most items are cheap (ish), but very poor quality. The fabrics can contain harmful chemicals. No more buying from Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I ♡ shien! My orders always come on time and they always fit perfectly if there clothes .if ur looking for fashionable cheap products you should get this app,but not everythings perfect some clothes are see-through and the rings aren't great either and surprisingly the makeup is not bad and if you get allergies really quick do not get the make up! but I really love this store and o hope u do 2!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app itself is nice, however, SHEIN HAS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THIS COMPANY IS VERY UNORGANIZED. The last few orders I've placed the experience with them has gotten worse and worse and the most recent one, I paid an extra $13 to have it delivered by 9/13/21 and they didn't even ship it out until that day! They are refusing to do anything to fix this Lile a refund or equivalent points or money in my SheIn wallet even though I have spent thousands in less than a year with them!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Been very pleased with my merchandise. Always read the reviews and check the pictures before purchasing anything. I have found great deals of kithen gadgets, body jewelry, belts, cute swimsuits and beautiful dresses. My only negative is that when buying fedora hats the packaging is very poor and they come smashed. The app works seamlessly though tons of great deals 👌"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely love shopping this site! I'm 29 years old and really love all the options and items I can buy. They give discounts on everything. I always spend about $200 and get about 20-40 items. The clothes fit perfect, I'm 210lbs and always get xl on the pants and shirts. 10/10 recommend and I shop on here as much as I can. Takes only a few days to a week but is sooo worth it. If you find something you love? You WILL actually love it more when you see it. Such a great shopping experience."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This shein application is very sucks! I had 2 package order and it's been almost 1 month I didn't receive my order and it's already paid. It's already December 2 and it's shows the delivery is on 25 or November. That's after 2 weeks after I place my order. I don't know where is my order now! It shows in the system that it's already shipped
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Some clothes are really good quality ..and some are not.. u need to read the reviews to tell.. in general app works great. Their delivery is usually faster than the estimate u get on the tracking page... customer service are really good and the staff are really helpful. I hope they keep this up
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I LOVE ITT!! All the clothes I've purchased fit amazing. The clothes are cute and cheap. I would really recommend this to anyone, and they have clothes that are for super tiny and skinny girls like me and plus sizes and I love that. Usually when u go to an online store like Fashion Nova it's mainly for hourglass figured people. I love Shein!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was surprised at the prices. Honestly, I thought things would be cheap, fall apart and take months to arrive. All my packages have arrived earlier than stated. Returns are easy. Especially with growing kids you can find great prices when you know your child will not be fitting into it much longer. Pleasant surprise!!!😁😁😁"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to like shein, and the service, but nowadays they use the WORST SHIPPING COURIER ""ANT Eparcel"", they neither have a phone number nor reply to their emails, I have placed an order since January 4, 2021, and haven't received it yet. I contacted shein customer service and they issued a refund, but I am not happy as I wanted my order so badly and many items are out of stock now. My packages were always delivered by whether DHL or Canada Post, and everything was good and efficient."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like how easy it is to browse through the app and the catalog is also interesting but there is one issue that can be quite annoying – since the language cannot be changed without also changing the currency, many products end up with automatically translated titles. Which makes somewhat hard to filter results."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I know ppl are boycotting this site due to harsh chemicals and overpriced items as they stated. However, what big company doesn't sell overpriced items? I see chinese-made fake stuff and probably toxic contents too. What I like about this site is how accurate their photo match in person, and sizing of the items. It's not a hit or miss. What u see is what u get. Unlike other sites that show you beautiful pics, but when delivered, it is nothing alike and it's either super small or super big."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Weird category separation, why is there a ""Home"" subcategory under ""Women"" and ""Plus"" are those home products different? 😂 I love the recommended section under each product, always shows similar items (which is what I want to see). There are some features that I don't personally use but overall good app! 👍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I like that Shein order arrived pretty quick compared to before. The easy returns has got me more motivated to shop with Shein now knowing that if the clothing doesn't work out I can still return it. The return scan baroda makes it even easier than previously. Only only con is not all items are refundable. & quality or material is not always like the pictures provided on their website. This is why I rate it a 3/4 star review.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Refund was never processed. It has been 2 months now. The items were wrong in my order LZC93838 and I returned them. It was marked as Reached Warehouse. But refund was never initiated. I asked for SHEIN WALLET refund for ease but now couldn't even track anything regarding it. I just checked and it says that on 12the Feb 2020 refund was processed and I should wait for 48hours.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love all the stuff on shien. If you love to shop on the website the app won't disapoint you. At first it was a bit hard to find some stuff on the mobile app but I love all the mini games that get you discounts and points and sheglam , you can make cool outfits on."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The clothes are very you get what you paid for, but as a fat woman it's one of the only places I can get trendy clothes that fit both my style and my body on a tight budget. They also always have some sort of coupon or sale going on, so you're bound to get a good deal."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love shopping at Shein! This is my 2nd order that I've place and I have been super satisfied both times. They have a lot of clothes to choose from. I think the app would be better if they had a feature to buy the whole outfit and the accesories/shoes that the models are wearing... EVERYONE can find their style with Shein!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Easy to use app. Everything you need is on there to buy for any occasion! There are different options, colours and styles. Straightforward app that isn't complicated with tons of ads. Easy to browse, search and there are so many discounts you can use."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is nice, the pictures are great but the actual products are GARBAGE!!! I've placed 2 orders with them just to give them another chance and was disappointed both times. I spent over $150 on each order and these clothes are, no joke, just as bad as items from wish. Nothing is true to size, nothing is made of comfortable material, everything STINKS, like seriously stinks...like chemicals. Never again. Just making sure I leave a review before I delete the app and try to return all this junk"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,4/29/2020 update *** I placed my order on 4/16/2020 Payment eas taken from my debit card And it still has not shipped out When i placed my order it said there would be a 3-6 day delay. Understandable however now its been over 13 days and its still processing. My previous review was based on my 2 previous orders but this has me thinking if i should even order again. ** I would recommend this app becasue it is reliable. I have made several purchases. They were all delivered in a timely manner.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The app is great. Everything is affordable but make sure you read the reviews to make sure it's actually a good product. My only issue isn't really with the app it's with the shipping. My order has sat less than 50 miles from me for at least a week if not longer. I could have gone a picked up my order in less time than it's taken to arrive. They are quick to initially get it shipped but the extra steps it has to go through is absolutely outrageous. Release the freaking package.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Your customer service is very poor there is no response from the hotline and the chat is worst.The problems are not solved as it has only fixed set of questions. I received a message stating that the delivery of the product was delayed and also mentioned to confirm that if I still wanted the order to be delivered (contact through chat or hotline). But both the mode of communication are not responding.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shipping is quick, clothes are affordable and I have been super happy with the quality so far! Sizing is a bit up and down but all in all almost everything I've gotten has been true to size. And even if it's not, it's returnable. My new favorite shopping experience, especially being plus sized!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Runs smoothly whenever I am on app. In the past couple of days though it doesn't load pictures when I try to see a different color of the same item (clothing). Other than that it's been amazing so far. Received all my orders that I've placed on there too.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I really wanted to shop more clothes from shein as they have good collection with resonable price but they took charges for returning from me( and its not an hassel free return n refund at all; dissapointed),it is very hard & lengthy process of returning and asking for refund...those who have huge extra time for return & refund and extra money to pay shipping charge (not refundable) for return ....obivously go for shopping from here...otherwise not at all advisable...application hangs sometimes."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Personally ive ordered 3 medium orders from them and wasn't upset with any! Sizing is just a LITTLE off but nothing drastic :) Shipping time is usually the day after placing the order and for it to get to my house takes about a week and a half! Clothing is cheap but not too cheap and i LOVE getting my clothes off here!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Before everything was smooth in this app, I could easily place a COD system but now it seems they don't pay heed to customers anymore, there isn't a COD system, even though Ive paid through prepaid system all my items are sold out after paying the money imagine my frustration, I got a refund but guess what they have deducted my money for eg.i paid 1350 for one item they refunded only 944 which isn't the original price that I paid for, I'm so not happy with the system of Shein... Not happy at all"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pretty good app for shopping, I've gotten some great deals, but most of the stuff on there is pretty expensive.. also the shipping and everything adds a lot to the total so even if you get something cheap it'll be a bit extra.. but like I said I've still gotten some great deals from it, and I'll be shopping here for a while"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"consistently has the best styles around at prices i can actually afford, love the functionality of the app. my favorite feature is the ""heart"" option to save items for later. makes it so much easier to browse for fun and then purchase at a later date when its convenient."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Perfect for anybody WITH or WITHOUT any sense of fashion. There's a little bit of everything and they have example pictures of plenty of angles and zooms so you can get a sense of the clothes. PLUS they have technical specs on everything on their site so you can see what materials and sizes you're dealing with. :)
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Affordable prices, big variety. You never have to wait months for your order to arrive. Whenever I had an issue with my order, customer service was quick to help, and they were really friendly. The quality of the products is cheap sometimes, but you can find out from the reviews on the items if they are worth your purchase."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Everything that I've received from Shein so far has been great quality clothing. Time frame has been faster compared to reviews. I'm very happy I gained a ton of weight and had to go back into the office and this place saved me. I am going to keep shopping! App is easy to use and I love thebwidg list THANKS!!!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The layout of the actual app is really good and there is almost always a sale and compared to other clothes shop it is actually affordable for a student with really nice clothes for everyone. Since at the moment I am finding that at other shops the style is all the same and most of the time the clothes aren't my style but on this app there is every sort of style in my opinion.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've received things I really like and I've received some stuff that the sizing was wrong or the way it's made it's to tight I can't wear it and a few other things. I don't send it back because it costs me money to send it back and sometimes the price to send it back is more than the actual price of the clothing. Just have to carefully look through and choose things that aren't to cheap. Other than that good prices, nice items, decent time delivery. thank you"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is ok 👍, ive been able to create some of the cutest outfits from it. There havent been any glitches or crashes on my phone, furthermore it doesn't require alot of data or battery life. My only complaint would be that some of the clothes are hits or misses so you have to make sure you only order clothing that have reviews (both good and bad) especially those with with pictures before purchasing. Other than that they have amazing sales and prices.👌🏾"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the app it runs very smoothly except when it comes to the search bar. It finds some things but it will often say that there is nothing there, or something doesnt exist They should look in to that because it gets annoying have to see every single piece one by one instead of just typing what I want."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is probably one of the best online stores. The app is easily navigated with no problems as far as my opinion goes. Items are delivered fast and always within the given expectancy. There's so much to choose from its impossible (almost 😁) to put it down! Get it, enjoy!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Haven't ordered anything yet but from my understanding from family that has ordered from Shein it mostly is really good quality for super cheap. I love the layout and that everything you could think of is on here! I like to think of it as a cheaper version of Amazon
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shein is a great app for the occasional splurge on some nicer outfits. You'll definitely have a good find here and there, but their options (particularly to specific styles of clothing, like grunge for example) are a bit limited. Shipping also takes awhile, sometimes a little over two weeks."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app so much! I redid my whole wardrobe with it. It has everything I needed between clothes, organizers for them, and decorations. Thank you! Definitely will keep using it. Everything is as it looks in the pictures. I've ordered over 20 items and have yet to get something wrong or bad quality."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Some absolutely amazing clothes in a range of style, colour and size. The downside is that it can be quite slow on computers and takes a while for the delivery to come. Everything else is brilliant!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I was very very happy with the orders until items from my bag just disappeared and from the website as well with no notification and also they started to refuse shipping certain items with absolutely no reason. Trying to get through a support agent was awful and although they were supposed to be available in that timeframe, they were not, and I had to raise a ticket (on which there was no answer) for something they could've just informed us in the first place. So disappointing!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love this app and the clothes. I just wish you could like something in the app and add it to your favorites without actually having to go into the specific page for the piece of clothing. then when you go back to the catalogue it takes you back to the top. only thing I would change.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I like this app but I had 350 points and all the sudden they disappeared. I'm extremely disappointed, I lost 3.50 in points that I got from buying stuff, what a waste, I prefer buying from Romwe, and I would recommend them. ( SIDENOTE: why do people keep complaining and giving 1 star for shipping?? Everything in this store is extremely cheap BUT takes a long time to ship, they normally take around 2 weeks or less for me, and these people are getting mad at it not being there by 3 days. )"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app, products are usually good for the price, the major annoying thing is that the items on your boards mix up after a few mins. I use the boards bc I like buying outfits and I want to see what will work with what. There needs to be a way to ""drag and drop"" or somthin to make items look nice next to other items. Items move around and don't stay in place. Everything just gets mixed up and it's impossible to have multiple outfits in a single board without making a millions different ones."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's great, love how there's always deals and coupons that are so worth it to use. They have a lot stock for very good prices,.quality as well is pretty good. Only downfall, return policy after the first return ... You have to pay, which I don't really agree. Other then that, very good recommend trying it out."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Always had a good experience with Shein. You get what you pay for which for me and my family is perfect. Delivery is as described, never had to return items. App is great ad it constantly gives you opportunities to earn points and always lots of offers and codes."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really happy about the quality of the products, wide varieties to choose from, trending collection, customer reviews available etc. Please keep all that up. My only concern SO FAR is the time taken for delivery. I think of all the online stores I purchase from, Shein takes the longest to deliver. In fact, i can't even order stuff for an occasion which is after couple of weeks!! That's sometimes disappointing. Could be great if it can be delivered within a week or ten days time at least."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"90% of what I've ordered has been good to excellent. Considering travel times at the moment delivery has been very speedy. T shirt sizing and quality is excellent , some of the other fabrics on dresses have not been as good. Overall I personally find it value for money and my 4 teenage girls enjoy shopping with me !"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great prices but very disappointed that they no longer give the 25% coupon and that they now want to charge $6.99 a month for an extra 5% off. That is NOT a deal. App works well though. Also shipping has gotten very very slow, way too long transit time."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is pretty decent. The delivery Times are a little long considering you pay the same for other products at other places and you don't wait as long. I find it annoying they display clothing that has already been sold out and some of the clothes and home stuff are just cheap.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Easy in every way! I've shopped on here many times! There have times where almost everything was amazing and times where it wasn't. The easy return policy is wonderful and the one time I had a problem and reached out to customer support it was solved easily. I love it and plan to order more in the future!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Happy with most of the purchases with Shein, I read the reviews before purchasing to get feedback on size, quality and satisfaction. The clothes look fashionable and great. The clothes that Don't fit I return them through the Shein process. Love the points the discount vouchers and the sales including free shipping. I am very happy with my shopping expearience with Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Some orders come quickly and others take ages. But the app is good - it runs smoothly, alerts all the sales, coupons, images are good and lists exact measurements for all the garments so there's no mystery in how things will fit. Also sends an alert once the local carrier is ready to deliver."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is really cool and really easy to use. Personally ill buy things from here from the website just because I can get more coupons because of honey, but other than that it's a very good app and I love shein. Definitely recommend for clothes shopping. But it can get easy to endlessly scroll on here tho xD."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Since the virus everyone is shopping so orders are taking longer so they gave 2$ in points. You check in everyday and you get more and more. They don't expire until 3 months later whish is great. Haven't gotten my clothes yet.. so I can't say anything about the quality of the clothing lol. But I've watched some YouTubers do hauls so I went pretty basic with my order. I got 4 shirts I believe and 3 two piece sets (shirt and shorts) so I got 7 shirts.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"There are great offers on the app. Some of the sizing can be hit and miss. Some materail not always great. But on the whole great experience. Returns are also easy to do and processed quite quickly. Great there's a loyalty scheme of sorts, with points gained being used towards purchases."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I like the low prices. The lipsticks and lip balms are high quality at a low price. Jewelry looks like high fashion jewelry. Easy to return unwanted or damaged items. The only thing i really don't like is its takes almost a month to receive your order.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I bought something and since the quality of the product was not satisfactory I returned it. They credited the money in my shein account. But after trying for more than 6 months and writing to them for support many times i am not able to use my credit balance and shop. It's so frustrating to use your credit money with this app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love the simplicity and organization of the app. I don't like how some of the same items are priced different. Need more details on the deception of the fabrics and materials the items are made from and with.. And diffently narrow down the estimatedd of now and 6 months
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"My only issue with this site is that if you need to go back from after pay to change something, it deletes your shopping bag items. You have to go through again and ""repurchase items"" that should just be saved in the cart. But, not a huge issue. Just a way to improve."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love it, all the things I've bought on here are the same as in the picture. Shipping takes a while because it's from china, but shipping is free every Sunday. I suggest checking out the flash sales.. they have some reasonably priced items for REALLY low prices."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I just installed this app. As soon as I finish with my registration and password my phone gave me a notification: ""this app has exposed your logging information including password. We recoemd changing it"". I have never had an issue like this before. I am removing the app and closing the just issued account."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shein is awesome! They have great clothing at an affordable price, and it is definitely plus size friendly. Some of the items are different than how they are displayed, but you just have to make sure you read the reviews before purchasing ❤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The products and gadgets they offer are great for the prices. Do go by your measurements to determine the size you need, most are true to size, but there are some that run smaller and larger (if in doubt, read the reviews). The flash sales are awesome, as well as the random free shipping."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Almost all you could want @ affordable prices as well as high end merchandise. A bit of a hit and miss with makeup, but the clothes are great, size up for a better fit. So much to choose from with afterpay option and arrives in decent timeframe."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I found that going by the product measurements and model measurements weren't helpful. ALWAYS look at the reviews, some things were less than desirable...but I've gotten alot of great stuff! Good shipping time though and there's ALWAYS amazing deals. Hard not to spend 1000 CAD a month on this stuff 😅😅"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I haven't had any issues with the app! No lags, no crashes, no glitches. Orders don't take long to arrive and customer service is great! E-mails regarding concerns about your orders are immediately acknowledged and resolved, the prices are awesome, and clothing is mostly true to size."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The clothes are actually way better quality than I expected, and shipping was pretty fast! Some of the fabrics are a little thin, but definitely doable. As a plus-sized person, I absolutely love them for the fit and price!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm a little obsessed! The items pictured IS what you actually receive. The clothes are made great quality and shipping has taken about a week to a week and a half for me, so that's a plus! They also have a great system for points which turns into dollars for your next order 😉"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great buys! Great prices! Quality and style. Just wish they had coupons for smaller purchases. The people are fantastic and soooo helpful! I'm very happy to have found SHEIN I don't feel like an old lady! They have the best styles even for us older women. I highly recommend!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I think this site is great. Trial and error if new. Always check the sizing on every individual clothing item as they can differ. Shipping is very fast as well and an added bonus and so glad i joined. The handbags are great quality. I took a little break and missed the site too much so am back again for more things!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app has gorgeous clothing for everyone in the family and just when I think that I can't find something any more beautiful than what I just chose I click to another screen and there's something just as amazingly beautiful. They also have a ton of housewares and accessories and just amazing! You got to check it out. Oh and by the way it's extremely extremely affordable. P.S: Their customer service team is friendly and helpful and every time I've had an issue they solve it immediately!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Easy to use, super cute clothes. And I love everyone's reviews, especially the ones with photos. Shipping doesn't take forever.. and there's always a discount coupon! Everything has been great quality. And there's free returns!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very good app with astonishing prices, has wide a variety of things; cases, accessories, clothing, home decor and much much much more. Would definitely recommend app and also don't expect to get 10/10 quality material for such cheap prices but the SHIEN definitely has 8 /10 quality material for cheap prices. SHIEN even offers many discount opportunities including SHIEN points which allows you to save money when already buying cheap things."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is easy to use. They provide size references and I haven't had too many issues choosing the right size. I do stay away from ordering pants because its harder to match. Clothing is always good quality, but delivery time is longer than other companies."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great, but there's a new problem after the latest update. Whenever I choose to change the colors for any product, it doesn't show up. I have to press on the photo and then it shows up. It's pretty annoying. I hope it can get fixed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein!! Everything I've ordered clothing wise has been true to size and great quality and I love everything they offer! The plus size clothing is fashionable and always in stock, the plus size lingerie is sexy which is a very hard thing to find. My only negative is that some of the jewelry is not very high quality and broke very easily. I will be a customer for life as long as the plus size selection stays fashionable and affordable."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is an amazing platfrom for buying clothes and many other things, not to mention the amount of discounts and coupons you can get. Most thing are quite cheap like nails, jewellery and other items. Although the clothes are not cheap they are great quality and I've never had one delivered the wrong size. Shein is amazing you should definitely check it out! <333"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,My experience so far has been wonderful.... The last 18 months have helped me explore and color my wardrobe with online shopping... What matters most is the reviews and the visual appearance on happy customers.... I have had returns and they went pretty smooth will a complete refund. Thankyou SHEIN for being there for my complete home....
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"While I don't really feel good about supporting fast fashion, they do have a good selection of nail art that is not only inexpensive, but the best selection out of completing apps. They ship quickly. So for that selection alone, I am giving it said rating"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"App itself runs smoothly very nice navigation features. I would have given 5 stars but when I signed up for text notifications I was disappointed to find that it was more than just a text in a day it was a bombardment of texts. Other than overkill on text notifications, the app is very user friendly."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I shop on this app alot but I don't like the fact that it is difficult to reach your customer care. No phone or email to reach you with for any complaints. For instance, my last two deliveries, I got something different from what I ordered and one Item was not included in my package. Even though I wrote that in the review of the items, no one has reacted to it. I'm very skeptical each time I order this days."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"worst shopping site Having excellence in making Fraud worst customer support service. most importantly, once you make a return, you have to wait for around 1 month in order to get your refund. I have still not received my refund and at the time of return they have asked to deduct only 60 from the payment amount but actual refund which is under process is much lesser than that."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app, lots of great discounts all the time, huge selection of items, quick and easy customer service too. However, always need to keep an eye on materials, fittings and reviews of clothing items since they all differ!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was skeptical about this website at first, but I have been using it for my grandkids Christmas, birthday presents for a year now, and I am very satisfied with the products & the delivery. I have had only one mishap with the delivery last year at Christmas time, the service they used delivered it to the wrong address & I never received the order. I called my credit card company & received a credit back & reordered. I received the second order just in time for Christmas!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"What I dislike Returns are expensive Spend over a certain amount to get free delivery. Only some times material and size not great What i like All sizes small to big sizes, nice clothes for everyone men women children and home. You can upload pictures of clothes + feedback to tell you how it fits & what the quality is like. Discounts, Sale and app treats. Points are to take money off from clothes via feedback n pictures. This is a good sight has good deals and the clothes are Brilliant."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall the app is great. However when it comes to paying, sometimes it says that they cannot confirm the card information even though everything is correct. I had some payment issues but everything was smooth and slick!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I wish you did not remove the option to filter product selection under flash sale. It was easier when I can filter it to what certain products I wanted to check, but now need to go through everything which is time consuming and boring at the same time. Please bring that function back!! Edit: thank you this feature is back. Now, please give us an option to edit reviews at least once. Thank you"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I just started on shein and I am so happy for this experience. There are lots of items to choose from and variety of items is so wide. The items are of good quality at also at a reasonable cost. Shipping of the items are relatively cheap and come to you fairly quickly. I am really enjoying this app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been a lover of using the app to find styles but I was super, duper, nervous about purchasing anything. Last week I did it placed my first order. It was great! I got my first of two packages. It was just a pair of shorts, the second box is the one I'm excited for, but they fit AMAZING. No bad smell, no funky fit, I was expecting wish quality. It's definitely not though from what I can tell. It's a whole level above that. Really happy so far. -Plus Sized girl user."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really like this app. The coupons you can get do help discount your items more than the amount of the tax, the bag your items go in before purchasing helps you keep track of your total so if you are on a budget you don't go over, the flash sales are pretty neat too, great selection of curvy clothes for plus size ladies."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The app is fine it works great. The concern I have is that there is almost no business appropriate clothing in the plus line. Certainly no high-end clothing like wool coats and suits. However the clothing that is offered is very good quality. I would just like to see more business appropriate wear.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Cool app! has many styles like preppy, cute, casual, korean, emo and more. there's only one problem. Whenever I am scrolling through the reviews and would like to go back, it glitches and keeps repeating the reviews for like 5 times. If that bug was fixed I would be very happy."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Poor quality products. They all look great when they arrive in very upmarket packaging but once you've used the items a few times they tear, unstitch etc. Then you don't have the option to go back and edit your reviews. I've uninstalled because I'm very disappointed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,World's best app for shopping . Very easy to use and easy returns . Quality of coth are very fine . And they send exactly thing they shown in the pictures. Its little bit expensive but i love it . Especially the clothes of plus size . I also appreciate to all team for such great co-operation . All the best SHEIN ... 👍👍
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Returns are easier then expected. I've order lots of things most things are really nice. Some too thin for my taste. Prices are fair and sale prices are great. Sizing sometimes not available. But definitely worth waiting for.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I have ordered once using the app. The app was easy to use and prices were inexpensive. Tracking my package was easy and simple (using the app) I was surprised at how fast my order came. Only thing that I didn't like was after I left a review on my order I couldn't figure out how to submit it.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,So many great products and quality has been really good and consistent. I have been able to get many things for my small business at great prices. Shipping to my house takes about 9/10 days. I've gotten accustomed to next day delivery with another big company however the money I'm saving buying through here makes it soooo worth the wait. They add products all of the time so it's fun to cruise through the app on a regular basis. My huge orders have always been perfect. Nothing is ever missing.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a nice app but everything sells out incredibly fast and there have been a few things I've really wanted and they've been gone in under 2 hours! They don't ever go back in stock, either. But the clothes are pretty nice quality and generally cheap! The sizing is super weird as well, it's hard to tell and sometimes it's WAYYY off. One time I got sweatpants (I ordered S) and they were so huge the bottom of the pant legs fit around my waist 😭. That being said, it hasn't happened a ton!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the clothes. There should a little more transparency with returning items. It was difficult for me to track the returned clothes. After returning the clothes, I couldn't figure out if I had received my refund. I still haven't figured out. Also, if delivery could be a bit more faster, it would be awesome. I love the collection and quality of things on SHEIN."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love shopping on Shein! They have great deals, fashionable clothing and shoes. They have beauty items, things for the house and alot more than that. The shipping is fast and have made no mistakes on my orders. I find myself looking on Shein everyday because i know i will get a great bargain. Thank You Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I think the quality of the clothes are excellent but size are so different on everything and it gets to be a hassle to return and exchange items. Also even if you buy something on clearance and there's no exchange or refund on the item and it doesn't fit properly you're pretty much out of luck.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this app, super easy to navigate, great filters to find what you're looking for or just browse. Great selection of clothes in all sizes, sizing measurements are really accurate, speedy delivery & everything I've bought has been good quality. Love Shein, order from the app pretty much once a month for a haul lol"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Generally you get what you pay for. A few items have been better than expected and a couple worse but for the price, the quality isn't too bad and shipping is good, usually arriving about 10 days after placing an order. I am about to try the return policy on an item I bought for my daughter but don't yet know how easy/efficient it is."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is the second time I've downloaded the app. Previously I found it difficult to use, as it was not clear how to fill in the address details. As so I could place an order. I ordered one item of which I received. I wasn't 100 percent sure if I would of received the item because checking out wasn't confirmed due to address not being able to submit . Therefore Shein lost out of a lot of custom as I used another online shopping app that was more functional. I really love ❤ the products shien"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing, affordable prices, great for anything, I personally recommend Shein for anyone, the only trouble is it doesn't have as many categories, but that isn't a problem, just a chance to expand the store. Amazing and great app, you should get it, or you won't know what you're missing out on!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Nice range of clothing. Placed 2 orders and received it in tact. Clothes for myself fit perfectly, had a bit of an issue with my husband's fit...still need to return it. Even with import tax it remains cheaper, without compromising quality, compared to prices in my country. It is currently my most favourite online fashion outlet."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Addicting to fashion. The quality, customer service, fast shipping is amazing. The opportunity to make points, winning coupons and flash sales make this app very entertaining and addicting. I also love the packaging, makeup, and all the unique stuff I can find on the website for home."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love the quality of everything so far. Super affordable for the most part. Easy process. You can find groups on FB with reviews and that is helpful. I also see mostly good reviews there as well. The app itself has been really easy to use. No issues.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely love shopping from here. I take a lot of care and patience in selecting my items but they are always worth it when I buy clothes, accessories, shoes and even nail art! I also feel safe knowing that if something does not fit me, they have a very flexible return policy. Making every purchase with full confidence."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Products are just as described. Other clients' feedback is very useful and genuine. I've been using the app for two years and never had any problems with the app or the delivery. Every now and then, but very seldomly indeed, the wrong size/ product might be sent to you but that is human error and immediately rectified. Absolutely no problem te get a refund."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The app and clothing selection are amazing! I haven't bought a single thing that didn't fit well or wasn't true to size. I love that they have the measurements the model in the pictures wear as well as the measurements for each size. It makes shopping a breeze!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Pretty Good Overall. Ads & Popups annoying at times though. Search function isn't the easiest, best or most accurate - partly due to the categorisation/tagging of items and product naming."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I think this is an amazing app. First of all you do not have to pay any money to sign in just make an account and if you want to buy something you can but they don't make you. Second of all it has all of my style of clothes and I just love how it's organized. Lastly I dated this a 4 because after a littlebit there get ride of some of your points.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love the items I have bought. Returns super easy! Delivery pretty fast. CONS; Have to watch the prices. Same shirt, different price depending on color choice or pattern (have seen up to a 10.00 difference!) Airbrushing so unrealistic in some photos, it's hard to gauge sizing based on photos. People reviewing don't always give true measurements. Listed sizing is bizarre with some items. Some T-shirts with writing are poorly translated and have grammatical errors or make no sense."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There's nothing wrong with the products my issue is how annoyingly the app pop's up. I want to see things when I go in the app not being harass all day to make more purchases. Another thing is that once you open an account is impossible to close it, you can log out and delete app (I being trying for 5 days to closet it and it wont allowed me demanding I leave full review with pictures) after completing it, still doesn't allow me to close account."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Delivery has been always prompt, over 95% of the products are true to size and color. Amazing and easy online shopping experience. Although I wish with tops to give options of bottoms to go with. Mix and match option would be a great deal."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have had a wonderful experience with shein. The app itself is well organized and easy to access. The orders ship fast and the items you receive are never mangled. They come in prime condition every time. I have ordered a lot from shein and have never been disappointed and neither will you!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Fantastic range, quality and price. Great customer service and sizing, so many offers and chances for discounts, delivery is usually within a couple of weeks and I've loved everything I've ordered so far. Clothing is mostly true to size, making it much easier to buy!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the products and the easy accessibility and the feature of filtering what you're looking for, evwryhring is easy to find and a variety of different stuff are offered the only problem is that I find up to 2 weeks time too long for shipping in addition to the fact that sometimes it takes longer which sometimes is up to a whole month bur overall I would still use this for any online shopping as I can easily find what I want despite the time period."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I actually really love this app! It makes finding what I need pretty easily and when I add something to the cart, it immediately shows me similar products to check out. I also love how you can get points for reviewing your items and just for confirming you received your package! The points turn into money off, AND you can use promo codes! The clothes has been really good 99% of the time !"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Worst app, already my experience was very bad with the return policy but though I order the stuff nd it's been more then a month I couldn't get my products nd they only sent me a long msg tht due to Christmas holiday the package will take the time but it's been 10 days to Christmas I still didn't get my packages. The winters are almost over so when will I wear my clothes. I ordered it for mainly new's eve"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Prices went up on already over-priced items (i.e. earrings). I get it; INFLATION. Free shipping seems to be a luxury of the past. Cheap prices and free delivery was the draw for me. Oh, and I purchased some adult sunglasses but the ones that I received would be a perfect fit for a 10 yr-old. They weren't worth returning."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great clothes shopping. App is fantastic with chances to win points to spend. Love the customer ratings/reviews feature especially where you can see what the clothes actually look like on real people and in what size. The sizing opinions are a good feature too. Loving shopping with the shein app!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was a little skeptical about ordering from here since a lot of places that claim they offer plus size, aren't actually accurate. But I've gotten 3 skirts so far and they are amazing! The shipping doesnt take very long and the site also offers free shipping deals often, so the prices are great imo. I definitely recommend it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent app experience. No glitches, very clear to use, intuitive controls, easy layout. My experience with Shein has been great, very pleased with the quality of products, speed on delivery and returns process."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Pretty new user. I have done one order and so far I don't have any bad to say. Very satisfied about the products and quality. Fast shipping. Some size charts are not always true to the size. As I noticed not long ago. I checked my measurements couple times before ordering and when item arrived it was little bit big. Nevertheless that customer service is very helpful and ready to help. You can exchange your item if the is availability at that moment.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Hi. I have loved this app and use it regularly to this day. I'm giving 1 star as of now because of the following reason. I have placed an order at 8th May, it's 27th May now and they still have not handed over my parcel to the logistics partner. I have tried calling them almost everyday but it's extremely difficult to get them to pick up the phone, when they do pick up the phone, they always give me the same answer that due to logistics issue they aren't able to ship. 1 star until i receive it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the SHEIN app as it is very easy to navigate, my orders are always on time and I have never had any issues with my orders. They also have a lot of items to choice from and that's what I love the most, the fact that it is a one shop stop for fashion and home accessories."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have been very pleased with everything I have purchased so far! Sometimes the fabrics are a little on the thinner side, but worth the money. Shipping time was way better than expected. Sizes are spot on if you go by your body measurements. Overall, a good experience!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Have always heard about this app but was reluctant to try it, now that I have I don't think I'll go back!! Affordable clothes, pretty good quality, sizing is a bit hit and miss sometimes but when you're getting decent clothes for decent prices I don't seem to mind too much. It has taken a while for my order to ship, it's still currently processing, but other than that can't complain much. I am super excited to see what I get!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My daughter orders from here. I was told shipping took a while. However my first order came pretty quickly. I was surprised! I ordered some winter hats that I love! And some clothing for my kids. Pajamas, mens lounge pants, underwear, and jewelry. Got some Christmas shopping done. Very happy with everything. Will be ordering again. I see a lot of unique and pretty shoes! They have just about everything!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Easy to navigate, refine your search and pay for your purchases. Clothing is inexpensive but cute!!!! I just wish that the sizing was a bit more consistent.......have bought a few things in the size that always fits if not a little big but doesn't here (all the time)."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Everything is fantastic, all meets the images and sizing. Homeware all brilliant. When ARAMEX is the courier there are no issues. If the courier is BAFFALO it is a disaster, never deliver earlier. Keep orders at their depot until dates given. Can not contact them in various ways, they are shocking! Love Shein all in all!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app. I was nervous the clothes would be bad quality because of the low prices but turns out it's just a great deal. Good quality, fashionable clothes, shipping tracking, honest reviews, and best of all, low prices. I recommend!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm addicted I love SHEIN so much its so fun and addicting. The app works perfectly fine, much you can do on the app. They have it set up so perfectly. This is the only shopping app that I would go out my way to leave a review for. Anytime I use FN website it's always issues like freezing, not loading, or taking forever to load yet they have nothing close to offer like SHEIN. You get so many ways 2 earnpoints like leaving reviews, checking in everyday etc. GREAT prices and flash sale is nice!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shein is a good place to buy clothes from depending on what you want, it's cheap and the shipping is quite fast, although the quality clothes has gone down a lot, the fabric is sometimes weird and not flattering, so I suggest looking through all the reviews on a product before purchasing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Has fancy stuffs. But sent me faulty one. Worst customer service. Very bad way of responding . Will take a week to refund. Chat never works. Responds after 18-20 hours through app - mail service. Calling is a nightmare. Wait 15- 20 mins to get connected
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Easy to use. It does not recognize most searches though even if the item is available on the website. Picture search is even more difficult, it does not bring the thing you're searching for. But overall it's a good shopping app unlike any other"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is good, prices are affordable, package arrives less than expected. You can find amazing items. CLothes are stylish and trendy however many of them are see through and with cheap material. I like the coupons and discounts. Hope there will be more generous offers! In general, i love shopping at Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the clothes on this app. They have the same clothes every other website has, but shein has the lowest prices out of all of the other websites. Great selection too. The only thing that could be better about the app is if the way the sizing is was different. But other than that I love shein!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Fastest and easiest experience I've ever had with an online retailer when I needed to modify my order! Also able to do so through the app. Really surprised and I believe my friends who are loyal buyers.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm using Shein app for like 3 years and It's very affordable, I especially love Sheglam products! I get excited more to shop when I found out about the Shein Petite! They're perfect! I don't get any issues about customer service, every thing is so easy even changing sizes or refund, it's all good, and not complicated. Thank you!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app itself is excellent and very easy to use. I have only good things to say about the app and the company. The company Shein is fantastic. Great customer service too. It takes around 2 weeks for items to be delivered to Ireland, which is fabulous. The packaging is amazing too, with every item individually wrapped. There's free delivery once you achieve certain purchase limits, there's discounts galore and you earn cents with reviews. Love this"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Shein has definitely been cheating on the customers. I doubt I will get anything from Shein from now on. I thought this is a reliable app but, absolutely not. It's like they make up new rules every other day and if you call the customer service, they have no idea about what they are talking. I placed a return request this last time and I haven't been refunded the full amount after shipping charges was subtracted. Nothing adds up. Will try to avoid this stupid app"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love shein! It has many fashion ideas and high quality products! Although there are some products that aren't that good but still has a good style. I'm just sad i can't purchase sheglam makeups because it's not available, i hope shein could bring back sheglam makeups because i think it is high quality and i wanna try it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've just discovered SHEIN. So far I'm very happy with all my plus size purchases. Some of the prints and colours are absolutely gorgeous. I struggled to find longer-length tunics (I'm 5 foot 7) and SHEIN is the answer. Wonderful! Would definitely recommend.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Everything I have purchased up to this point has been remarkably great quality, great value and great delivery times. My kids got me on to Shein at Christmas when they asked for some things on their wish list, then my daughters Holy Communion came up and it saved me in so many aspects of the even. It really feels like something I go to prior to shopping and then after cause I obviously haven't found what I was looking for when window shopping, this goes for all products not just clothes."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have only ordered a bunch of stuff once so far. Summer tops, earrings and bracelets to accessorize and strappy heels for every occasion. It all came in exactly as described and on time. So I'm really enjoying Shein so far. Way better than Wish, that is a horrible distributor and app !!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've only ordered a couple things from shein, and honestly it's pretty good. I mean the clothes aren't top notch quality, and the size charts aren't too accurate, but you can wear the clothes more than just a few times and they're decent. I have another order coming in and I have a lot of faith that they're going to fit well and look cute. I also love the size range this brand has. it's nice as a bigger person to be able to buy trendy and cute clothing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"SHEIN is a fantastic option for stylish clothes that are also inexpensive. There are obviously a few cons that come with online shopping, like not knowing what size to purchase, the true quality of an item, etc. HOWEVER, I will say SHEIN does a great job of including the models measurements do you can give your best guess. They also have free returns, so there's always the option to return your haul if your not satisfied with what you've purchased."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"shein has a variety of styles and the majority of items are good quality. I've got a couple of items which weren't well made but were cheap so who cares. anyway always read the reviews and you'll be good. they ship worldwide but you have to wait a week or two for your package. anyway,more than half my clothes are from shein and I can honestly say I wear them on a daily basis. my style is punk/hippie and I love the romwe collection a lot. all in all a big thumbs up!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great prices and customer service. I've had to return a few things because of sizing and it's never been an issue. Quick delivery and responses. Rewards system could be better, but the clothing is such a good deal that I can't be too upset about it. Just be sure to read the reviews, descriptions and sizing info before making your decisions."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love the choices and variety! Price drops and discounts makes it even more interesting! Don't have to worry about how the product will look on you due to Byer feed back and photos.Because everything looks so good on models, it's going to fool you thinking you will look the same😁"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Surprisingly good quality clothing at affordable prices. Includes a huge range for plus sizes too. Easy to use navigation. Fast international shipping. Biggest criticism is that it can be hard to get an accurate idea of the material type - may have to rely heavily on reviews to get a good idea of what fabric to expect.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I just love the deals. Finally a reasonable website for plus size where I feel I can get everything I need to wear and more. The app has not failed me yet. There is a ease of use and my favorite thing is that i can put a bunch of things in the cart and pick which ones I want to order without removing items from the cart.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Honestly for a clothing store that out of the states this is one of the only ones I trust and will buy from always until proven otherwise. Pretty fast shipping and the sales and even regular prices are a huge plus. The best thing is to check reviews and item material and you will be fine
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Skepticism aside. This website is actually legit and sends the products quick. And its super easy to return anything and doesn't cost which is awesome for a company to offer. Even though its probably factored into the price in the first place. But yea, i was super skeptical at first and its great. Definitely reccomend."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Overall I like the variety of cloth, fabrics, and price. They are 2 things that maybe can improve: 1) take to long to receive the merchandise. 2) The description of the cloth needs more details, example: if is a normal size or run a little bit tight. Because no all the fabrics are the same, some are more elastic than other, more tight on the belly etc. Other than that all the pieces that I recived had good quality."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very good you can post your own purchases on there to help others out and get a look on what their clothing looks on different sizes of people, for some sections you can even customize measurements (though I've only found that once so maybe a clearer setup for that would be good) things are fairly decent in price, a lot of cheap offers but some seem too expensive but definitely not a ridiculous ask."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I ordered a few times and shipping is fairly fast. Majority of the items were very good and super cute, and the few I didn't like I was able to send back and get a refund very easily. So far, their customer service has been great! Very easy to shop with them, I definitely recommend!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"the app and the shop overall is good, but please add English language to the Polish location!! ever since I moved and changed the location accordingly it became almost impossible to understand the categories, it's ridiculous how the interface stayed in english but categories changed. and pics of the categories are not always accurate, so that's just a really frustrating game of guessing"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very pessimistic before using but shouldn't have been. Ap is very easy to use, everything that I have bought - around 10 items so far - have been described very well and totally accurately. Pricing is very good, and sometimes its very very good as the pieces look, feel and made more expensive than what you've paid. Deliveries are very honest and ate true to word. Overall I'm extremely pleased and I've definitely found my new obsession. I'd give 11 out of 10, if I could."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Good clothes at a cheap affordable price. However. Do read customer reviews. Some items are smaller than they seem, and the underwear can run on the very tiny side. Great if you are tiny, not so great if you are a uk size 12 and a 36b. All in all tho, you get what you pay for. Some items are great. Others not so much."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great user-friendly app with lots of really useful features such as search by photo, customer service chat to name a couple. As for SheIn itself, I love it. Great prices,refreshingly diverse designs that you don't see on the so called high street and a ridiculous amount of choice. What's not to like !?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,My overall experience with shein has been great. I bought my first batch of items 2 weeks no issue and about to recieve my next batch next week or so. The coupons help you save especially now that we are about to go into a recession. Thank you shein and other app like it. Afterpay quadpay & fashion nova amazon too. My saving graces 😘❤
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have only bought once from SHEIN. I have had a great experience. I only returned 3 or 4 items out on the 12 I ordered. Two of the items were due to, me personally, not likely the way I looked in them. The third was a coat that I ordered a size up (to accommodate for sweaters) and it was a lot bigger than I needed. So I will order it in the correct size. But so far everything has been good quality and held up after washing. So I'm a happy camper. 😊"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Been using the app for sometime now and the one thing I have noticed is that they keep making it harder and harder for customerd to get customer service on their app :/ not only can you not making any calls to their customer service center(probably because it doesn't exist), they have made it really hard to even submit tickets and modified it to such an extent that you won't even know if your complaint has been seen. After I get my latest order I will delete the app BECAUSE OF THIS."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"First app ever to make shopping so easy and accurate. All the items I've order so far are exactly as the pictures and sizes. The app is so easy to manage, shipping is super fast and prices are incredible. Love using SHEIN & highly recommend it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love it. Only thing I wish that could be considered is that certain items are not shipped to our end, like make up and small electronics like earphones etc. Would have certainly liked to order and buy the lots 🙄. Maybe this could be changed ... ? Know tons of people who would love to receive such items."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Fantastic despite most sketchy online shops, Shein is surprisingly fantastic and I am rarely disappointed with quality. The app interface is clear and easy to use. My favourite part about Shien is the maaaaaany user reviews (with pictures!) which makes products much easier to trust and you can actually see the quality from previous buyers."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm always skeptical about ordering anything online, but the clothes and accessories are so cute and amazingly affordable. So, I thought I'd a do test run with a cute dress, t-shirt and clearance ring to start. I placed my order on March 3rd, it shipped 2 days later and it arrived on the 11th. It arrived in a nice Shein zip bag(inside the shipping package) and the quality of the dress and shirt are great and the ring fits perfect. I'm excited that I've found a good online clothing company!! Thx"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! I can get cute clothes, accessories, makeup, etc from one place. Yes, the items come from overseas however the shipping is actually really quick compared to some other apps (wish, geek, etc) similar prices but quicker shipping."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's an aammmaazinng app!! The dresses are extremely cute and sexy at the same time! It's just too adorable I fall for almost every other dress! Shein has its own unique fashion sense and everyone should try it! I totally love the app!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love everything i have experienced from shopping, to ordering and recieving my items. I am still learning the website but i think it's great. I love the many choices. I love the fit and feel of every purchase. I have recommended your website to many and will continue to recommend it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,My daughter loves shopping here and great deals !! She loves the clothes and jewelery ! Very affordable and if you want you can make smaller payments every two week or so. i say try it out and if you dont like it just delete the account ! But overall will let her shop here ! Trustworthy app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love love love this company. Most of their clothing is amazing quality and super worth it, and I love their rewards system. The only thing is that you DO have to be careful and look at the fabrics, look at the measurements, and look at the reviews. They are generally honest and accurate. I've only had about 2 or 3 things I've been MEH about, and I've been shopping there for like a year now. Do recommend! But again, as with all shopping, LOOK AT THE DESCRIPTION and you will be happy!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Shein feels so much more then just an app where you can buy stuff. They have contests and sometimes games where you can win points that go towards a purchase. I love this app. Also I only ever had a problem one time with shipping not even sheins fault but they still helped me find my package. Also prices are amazing with the amount and range of stuff they have I'm always impressed.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I'm so addicted to this site! I have never had an ounce of trouble with any of my purchases or returns. Shipping is quite timely overall. Prices are usually awesome. It appears newer fashions for fall/winter seem to be a bit more expensive. And they sell everything
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My daughter's and I love Shein! We've bought lots of clothes that we get compliments on and they have tons of affordable nail art supplies. With the low prices and discounts it's really hard not to keep buying more and more 😄. The only thing I don't like is how half of the cute shirts are only half shirts. Those are not allowed in school. It's kind of inappropriate. And as a plus sized woman without a flat stomach, I'm missing out on a lot of cute tops. Wish they'd come long and short."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love all the options of clothing offered by Shein plus the prices are soo reasonable. And quality has improved so much compared to before. I would like to mention that even though orders come overseas it arrives in less than 2 weeks including right now during the holiday season. I love to shop at Shein!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love everything. Great clothes. Great services. Everything. Things may sometimes come smaller that expected, but that's on you because you chose the size. I have never had an issue with website or the quality of my clothes I love it and their many discounts."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. Update: I'm having issues where I now can no longer view reviews people leave on the clothes, it just comes up as a black screen. I only got a resolution when I changed my rating, but they did respond and fix my issue quickly. 😂"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love it so far. As a plus size woman it's amazing to get this many options. People are amazing with reviews too to if your picky up can be sure to find something that fits. Can't wait to order more. The options are endless.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love, love, love the true to size and the quality of the clothes please don't stop having good material. They're very fashionable. Better than my local clothing stores. Need to improve delivery time, need to make more shorter in length pants for short people so they are not dragging on the ground. I am glad I found Shein because I have a whole new stylish wardrobe now and I get a lot of compliments. Better than Wish they're clothes even the biggest sizes were way too small."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very good pricing, the quality is good for a cheap marketing. I love the many varieties and options they have open, and the different styles. The app in general is great, no glitching or adds. Very straight to the point. Love it, definently recommend this app"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app and the clothes are lovely - well made, good quality fabrics and excellent value for money! I got all my summer holiday dresses last year and I've ordered again for this summer. Delivery has always been much quicker than their estimation. Returns are really simple and refunds are really quick. If I could give 6 stars I would - brilliant! Going to put my order in for Summer 2023 shortly!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have been shopping here for a few years now and have only had one bad experience where I did not receive everything in my order besides that everything else is great the quality of the garments and the sizing are perfect. I bought sandals and two bags as well those were perfect and the swimwear is amazing.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I think it's a great app! U can easily see what size u need by watching the size of the model, and the reviews. Very cute stuff always! Ordered 7 shorts last summer and one was slightly too big! But the rest off it fits amazingly and the shipping is also very fast! Love it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"not great quality, returns are not free and they send out the wrong sizes sometimes. also theres rumours about them collecting passwords and hacking spotify and netflix accounts, but i havent had an experience like that. u get what u pay for ig. its cheap for a reason."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My experience has been excellent! One time I cancelled an item and immediately received a notice telling me that I will receive a refund in a matter of days and I did. What I like the most is that Shein keeps you inform of any transaction, order, shipment, detail, etc., and that is a plus for me."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, so easy to use I use the app multiple times a day. Nothing bad to say. The only negative thing is the free express shipping I get as I always order large orders so get express shipping however it still takes a long time. I'm waiting still for a order over 11 days ago (not a app issue but more of a shein delivery issue)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Not bad, not great. The photos aren't realistic, obviously. Customer photos help a lot. I'm 5'10"", so the tops I got are a bit too short for me. The pics they used made them look longer. But I didn't read the size charts so it was my fault. Other than that the prices are great and quality is you get what you pay for. delivery was on time."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really like this app, it's easy to use. The clothes are good quality and ship pretty fast (for international shipping). I took one star because they charge $3.99 shipping and then another $0.99 for shipping guarantee, so I feel it's too much of a charge."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"🛍👏🏾😍 Shein is the best shopping app I have ever used! I placed my first order back in March, it shipped in 4 days and it took 2 weeks to get here, but it was worth the wait! My order came in perfectly! Great quality! What I love about Shein is that you can shop in different categories from men's clothing, women's clothing, plus size clothing, kids clothing, shoes, accessories, etc. The prices are cheap and the clothes are so cute! Very easy to shop! Highly recommend it 👌🏾☺❤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,They have great plus size options. I just wish the plus items were as discounted as the straight sizes. Some of the items are way over priced and dated or not good quality. Need more sizing consistency.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall is a good experience, the packages arrived earlier than expected, the price of the clothes is good, and the app is easy to understand. The only problem is that sometimes (more than I'd like) they sent the wrong size, specially when it comes to shoes."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love this app. The quality of the products are amazing, the prices are too good to be true. You always can get rewards and extra discounts. The shipping time wasn't that bad. Packaging of the items was astounding. The bags your items come in can end up being so useful for storing other items around your home. This place has clothes for everyone of all shapes and sizes. It truly makes fashion affordable."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Some sizes are off. Either bigger or smaller. They have gotten better about explaining the products better so when they arrive you know what to expect. Not bad for inexpensive clothes I recommend this company to anyone looking to buy cute clothes that won't break the bank. Even their home products are decent. Just remember you get what you pay for so not everything will be up to par.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I had very bad experience with this app. My order got cancelled by itself. And if never received my refund. I called and tried to resolve it. But there were no positive response from their customer care. They have their ideal dialogues, they don't know how to deal if issue got escalated. They just Close the ticket and ignore as much as can"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"They have some great and amazing products at affordable prices, some are questionable than others but overall I'm very impressed with most of the products I've bought the last two years of using this app and I'm not planning on stopping anytime soon. I definitely would recommend this app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this online clothing store! I don't like in person shopping at all, trying things on gets annoying, and time consuming. I can see pictures of real customers and how they fit on people similar to my size. Free returns! Great rewards. This is my go to for all my clothing so far!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really like shein; it's affordable and has cute stuff, but the thing that makes me give it 4 stars is that the plus sized section needs more cute fashionable things. It has definatly improved in the plus sized section but only a small portion is cute the rest looks like something a middle aged women wears to work. So If the plus sized section get more actually wearable things thus definitely becomes a 5 star app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love how it's very easy to navigate the application. The clothes are cheap but good buys! Products are always same as what's on the photo. Great packaging too! What's need to be improved tho is the refund service. You gotta pay for the shipping if you need to return the item.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love the prices... will rate quality next. I recieved my orders. SEVERAL ORDERS NOW and it's only been about a month. SHEIN is excellent. Excellent prices... excellent quality... excellent style and excellent service. Have received all my orders ahead of time. Not just my clothing, but I ordered for my son and daughters and everything is amazing. I'm truly impressed! I can't imagine going anywhere else anymore. And if I do, it would be just for the experience of a girls day out. 🤷‍♀️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this app and this company!!! I can't believe how amazing it is! I passed it up so many times and then right before Christmas I decided to give them a try and was pleasantly surprised by everything! It's easy to use, their prices are amazing, their shipping is fast compared to most everything else lately (10 days max), the quality of their products are great for the most part (90% of their things are 4and5 stars), and they offer free return shipping! U gotta try it!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The only reason I don't give Shein a 5 star rating is because the quality of the clothing still isn't the best and I've gotten things that had the pockets sewn together on one side or there was a hole in the armpit already, strings that were loose etc. There are a few other small issues as well, but the price is still pretty good, the clothes are gorgeous, and I get so many compliments when I order from them."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Extremely mixed. Some of Shein's items are extremely good for the cheap price and some are pretty damn bad. But, inexpensive comes at a price, especially here. Shein is known for unethical labor practice and the practice of blatantly copying designs from other artists and stealing people's photographs to use as modeling pictures. Point blank, they're unethical. Which is a terrible shame because I have some stuff I really like from them and I want to keep ordering from them but feel awful."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've ordered lots from Shein and I've been pleasantly surprised. Nearly all orders arrived early, the clothes look lovely and fit well. Their plus size range is excellent, best one I've seen. Only thing that hasn't worked out for me was the bras, even though the size claims to fit, they're too small. Other than that, really happy!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm not a huge online clothes shopper, but shein is awesome. The clothes are at a great price and the quality is worth it for what you pay for. They have so much to choose from and it's been alot of fun. Just make sure to take your measurements and pay attention to the sizes because each size can be a little different. You can definitely get alot of stuff for a decent price And you end up feeling like you went on a $400 shopping spree. It's awesome. Love it so much."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love shein - I buy alot of things from here, there is so much choice and variety of items they sell. It is extremely cheap but they quality of almost everything is excellent. There are no ads AT ALL and the delivery is super quick. Thanks!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been ordering from Shein for a while now and have gotten some really nice outfits. You have to read the descriptions and reviews carefully. Don't pay attention to the sizes, read the measurements they provide! I always have a tape measure handy when I'm ordering. I'm a UK12/14 and I've ordered everything from a size 10 to a 1XL from them. They also have some good beauty products and homewares now and the delivery times are getting quicker to the UK which is great!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Recently was putting together an order to make a sizable purchase and shein kept trying to get me to buy just a few more things to get free and a faster shipping, of course I love shein so much and that would be sooo easy but then they told me at the end of that.their are certain items could not be available for fast shipping.the are sending it in 2 parcels, why couldn't they have offered fast shipping still for the items available for it? The items look like they are in 2 parcels.not happy"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The packaging of each items are what stood out for me, they are re-usable and strong. One of my packages came a week earlier than expected, which was great. The app is so easy to use and straight forward and fun to play with. The sizing and quality of the items are incredible and precise. You get exactly what you order."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I haven't yet received my order so I can not atest to the quality of the product s, I can however state that the app is very simple and easy to use. The ordering process is also very easy and can be completed within two minutes. I have had a great experience with this app and it's processes. If you are looking for brand specific products this app is not for you on the other hand if you are looking for unique products this is just the place for you."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app runs flawlessly. The items are very priced cheaply. Shipping/returns run smoothly, although I did have an issue once, but was able to resolve it with ease. Definitely read reviews, items can be cheaply made."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely no issues so far. I was skeptical at 1st but pleasantly surprised. So much so I've ordered more. Just be realistic about delivery times as some do have to be shipped from abroad, but some to arrive within a week of ordering. Happy with purchases and app is easy to use"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm a regular customer and loved shein but over years I've experienced that shein has not only increased the prices of the merchandise but has also started to decrease the rewards. We get less points on regular check in and also on occasional games. Also, the price of the clothing has increased even in the sales section. Me and my friend circle are shifting to other apps."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Inventory seemingly endless, daily sales, unbeatable prices all year long. The sizing varies read the descriptions and details of your items. Helps to read reviews before buying. Not the best customer service; difficult access to speak with customer representative."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Personally, I love the app. I love the affordable prices and the clothes. Lots of clothes are very cheap and very cute. The only thing I'd say is a con is how long the shipping takes but everything in the app is for everyone. They have kid, men, woman, curvy and plus clothes etc. The app is very beneficial"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love Shein. I discovered it well over a year ago and have just gone crazy buying dresses and tons of everything. They have everything from track lighting to dog clothes and combat boots. They have amazing deals. I'm a sucker for the flash sales. You just can't beat getting a top for $3. I tell everyone about this site. I have bought 15-20 dresses in the past year from them. I am in love. And it didn't break the bank.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Would be nice if you created an option where we could sort out the wish list. It is tiring to look for items since it's unorganised, I wish I could create a wish list. Also please we need the currency rate of my country, it is annoying having to deal with dollar always"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The issue I have, if I am looking at an item in one color or size, if I click to look on the same item in a different color or size, I get a blank screen. In order to see the next item I have to click on it again and call it up and wait for it to appear. This started happening a couple months ago and has not fixed. It seems to be a bug in the system. Fixing it would be greatly appreciated!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The worst of the worsts. I have a refund on my wallet which I can't even use. Why the hell can't you make things easy for your customers? Learn from Amazon. If you have funds on your wallet, why can't you apply it? Make it simple, let it automatically apply at check out. I wasn't able to use it. I initiated a chat where I got an automatic response that I needed to select prepaid payment as a mode of payment which I did and ended up charged the whole amount to my card. What a scam,shame on you"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"CUSTOMER SERVICE SERIOUSLY SUCKS! After never receiving my package, they still never refunded the money to my account. I checked my bank statements and now I can't see any transaction for that order on any of the cards on file. IT'S BEEN TWO MONTHS! won't help me just because on their end it says it was processed when it clearly wasn't. Also, a lot of clothing on the site is not worth the price they set. Cheaply made. Your best luck is with their gadgets...if they even work when you get them 🙄"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is my new favorite on-line shopping store. Aside from having the current styles, the prices are phenomenal!!! The bonus coupons also help Save Alot of cash!!! Another dollar store not just limited to call the thing they've got great shoes and fabulous accessories. If you haven't tried Shine already don't waste any more time!!! You won't be disappointed!!!! Crazy4clothes👠👗👚👢👒👖👙🎽👡"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Smart and easy to follow app. Lots of wonderful items. Descriptions are clear and concise. App show different ways to use the item and many times how it is packaged. Great App. Would and have recommended to my friends.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, I use it so much and I'm in absolute love. The clothing on here is so affordable and also super adorable. The only issues are that deliveries can take a little while and some of their clothes can be misleading so make sure you read the reviews. Overall I've found some very cute articles of clothing and will continue to use this app in the future."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've purchased 3 times Each order was usually there is 3 or more things in each delivery. I am very pleased with fast shipping,easy ordering,payment options. And Im pleas3d with the quality of your products. My only problem has been with the sizes. I was confused on which size i was between medium and large. The dresses and skirt were all too big. I chose large as it seemed to be my measurements. They were about 1 and 1/2 sizes too big. Maybe a easier size chart ?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I've ordered an item from this online shopping app. I payed through card. I payed the item and the delivery fee. But since my location is far they keep passing my order to different delivery service. I sudjest. I you will order any thing from this app. Don't pay through card. Because they don't care about your items once it's paid. I've contacted also the customer service about this and no agent is available. I tried to order in (Noon app) they were able to deliver my item on time.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love this app. All your favorite products are literally in one place. The prices are affordable and opportunities are available to earn points. Who doesn't love a fabulous discount? Simply, apply points to your order to save. Everyday cute new products are released. This is the best shopping app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Haven't ordered anything from the app as of yet,but very excited at the prices,the many different choices,and the low shipping cost. It's nice that the models for ""plus sizes"" actually reflect the clothes their modeling."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really love this shopping site. As a foreigner living in Taiwan it's easy and convenient and I can always find my size... Only downside I'm having is that because I'm in a Chinese speaking region everything is now in Chinese (name, address etc). That would be okay but I do not have a Chinese surname so I would have to ask a classmate/friend to use their name when ordering. I wish they would change this back to the original where I could use by own English name."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love Shein! Great prices and fast shipping and the goods match the pictures 100%. Also, many reviews show the goods anyway because you get reward points for doing so. Which is brilliant for knowing exactly what you are getting. All the purchases I received from Shein, I have loved."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein!!! I'm a US size 16/18 and sometimes it's hard to find clothes that are my style AND flattering AND good quality. (It's like I get to pick one) the trick to ordering is to follow the size chart and read reviews to see how the item fit others, I have ordered maybe 8-10 pieces from Shein and only had an issue with one of the bathing suits everything else fit great was cute and amazing quality (true unicorns)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a great app, a one stop solution for all your shopping needs. what I love is how you can view others' reviews to help you make better shopping decisions. I find some really great stuff that I never find or is too expensive when I do offline shopping, so this app is just my answer!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I have made a few purchases and overall very happy with all of them. I do suggest when looking at sizes also look at measurements of items and that was extremely helpful especially when buying a outfit for a wedding and other special events.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've got a lot of stuff from SheIn. They're usually good enough quality for the money. I love that they have Afterpay! Makes it much easier to shop. Make sure you measure yourself correctly. Sizes are small. I'm size 18 New Zealand, and size XXXL usually fits perfect. Also read the reviews. Packages come in about two weeks to New Zealand, sometimes longer. The packaging is always good. I have a huge collection of SheIn zip lock bags now 😆."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is an amazing shopping app it's easy to use, it has absolutely everything at your fingertips clothing, bags, jewelry, swimwear etc you can also earn points to pay at check out and the products is of good quality. I would definitely recommend this app"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love to buy from Shein. Everything is value for money and you get exactly what you see in the picture. The description is always very informative, so before you order always have a look at the measurements as they vary. They are the best for discounts . And their clothes are really fashionable. They have other things for the house and beauty so you have a vast selection. They arrive within a week or even less so I will definitely keep buying from them. Especially if more kitchen stuff is added"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I would give it a 5 ☆ if they improved their shipping times. Their quality is very good at a very good price! I love that it gives you the measurements on the sizes which are quite accurate, so you never get the wrong size base on measurement."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,App is great . Ordering and returns are easy ... but there is no way to track ur order once placed. Sometimes orders take long to reach n there is no way a person can know at which stage of transit is the order or even whether its been dispatched .
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"What you see isn't really what you get. Cheaper items are sent, duplicate of image on website. Not actual item. Good price, but your paying for just what you'll get. Not even close to high end, maybe lower class, trailer look kind of clothing. Bursting with Hooker clothing for private or business. Pretty stuff, you want it all"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love the fact that new styles are added when I shop. Love the styles and the prices. Shipping time is great still in the pandemic. Introduce my daughter and shes hooked. Also I loved the fact on returns you get no hassle on returning items and refund policy is great. I love the time frame of refund. My only complaint is on returning is the labels. Everyone doesn't have access to a printer to print return labels
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best prices, nice quality - I was shocked how nice 95% of items are. Read reviews, look at the photos & you'll have a better idea of each item. Returns are easy & free unless you return more than 1 item (same order) separately **be sure to have your own pkg'ing, UPS store charged almost as much for the box as items I return. Check it out, you'll be glad you did. Always buy clothes based on your measurements - check descriptions. look at sizes for everything including Non clothing items."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this shop. Don't mind paying percentage of 3 instalment but you have to add klarna, and pay 1st instalment on order. You can pay for all up front then they refund you when they get returned good . I sent something back as ordered different colour of some items. Sorted my instalment done with in 4 days which is really quick. Best to order to get free delivery. But its also free returns. And sizes fit great . Costing me a fortune where the clothes are great choice for large curve women."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Fabrics are very good for the cost. I love the plus size selection, especially the swimwear. My delivery came much earlier than originally planned. I mis-sized my first order and had to send it back...with no problems. Waiting on return of money still. In general I am very satisfied."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The clothes from this are nice but I have many complaints. First off they did not give me notice that on top of my $130 order there would also be a 40 dollar customs fee on top of that. It has been nearly impossible to delete my account. Shein gives your information to anyone who has paid for/ supported their company. I want to delete my account but its taking so long and I'm really frustrated. DO NOT USE THIS APP!

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app! So many different items to choose from: pens, stickers, clothes, fidgets, shoes, jewelry, makeup and more! The only issue I have with the app is how it doesn't let you edit a review when u upload it. It's officially uploaded. But otherwise, it's a great app!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Fantastic. I have two little boys and finding cute clothes for them is always a hassle. With Shein, I get great quality clithing6 for them at a fraction of the price that I would pay on Amazo or the like. I've also been able to find some nice stuff for me, which isn't always easy as a plus sized woman. I've enjoyed using this app, and it's super easy. 10 /10 would definitely recommend."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein, i love the amount of options that they have available and for all sizes. Absolutely love it. Only issue at times is the shipping part or processing time- it can take too long. But besides that it is my number one go to site."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love, love love the Shein app x. I've managed to pick up quite a few bargains whilst being on a tight budget but the quality of the clothes doesn't diminish because of this x. The site is easy to use, communication is very satisfactory, I've never had to return anything so I'm not sure how that facility works but over all I'm very impressed with this shopping site x."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is the best app ever, amazing for online shopping. Prices are reasonable and if you check in everyday you get points which means things cost less. You can add things to wish lists or boards. You can return things if they don't fit or you don't like them. It is just literally amazing. Would definitely recommend ✨💖"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love shopping with them. They make it so fast and easy speciallyif you use the app. Some of their items are not as expected but they have free and easy returns. For the most part I'm super happy amd pleased, I'm no longer shopping anywhere else. I refuse, I can get everything here for cheaper."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They steel small businesses designs. I can't figure out the stupid sizing chart! They show the size of the clothes, but it doesn't fit at all with the size I'm supposed to be. Feels too sketchy to even try and buy something. Fast fashion. Lots of choice and beautiful, but this cheap smells fishy. Choose better."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Good stuff most of the time, great shoes suprisingly, I've bought 2 different kinds of boots and they are both high quality for super cheap. The clothing has potential but is usually not what I expect, not in a bad way though?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent and fast delivery, good quality. Shein got a variety of goods and sizes are very true to size. Prizes are also quite good and not to expensive. Love to shop at Shein and will recommend it to my friends. Lots of my friends bought from Shein and they all talk with great loyal from your products. I would love to see some more sizes for the ab crystals that I have ordered. The quality looks very good and I can't wait for it to arrive. The size is a bit small s12 but is ok to put in between"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's honestly a very useful outlet to buy clothings/Accessories off of and sometimes can be a cheaper option in contrast with day to day shops. The reason why I took away a star is only due to the fact that the search engine is still not fully fixed,Ut got way better though!! Huge improvement."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Best shop EVER!!! Cant live without it! I love how you can earn points and each point equals cash value towards whatever your purchase is not to mention the live feed where you can win extra prizes and the little games that you can win extra prizes not only that.. but they have some of the most amazing clothes from toddlers to infants for babies to adults and every genre of styling between!!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoy shopping with Shein. Very good quality soo many different products to choose from. You can earn points and use coupons. An helpful, respectful customer service is a plus...I recommend for everyone!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is perfect for people who are in need of trendy fashion for low prices. They have so many cute clothing options for all shapes and sizes, with the addition of several coupon options every time you buy! I only have a slight problem with the tracking services, as sometimes it's not always up to date. Other than that, GO SHOP RN."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is easy to use, and there is always good deals on and coupons regularly, most of the products are good quality only some sizing issues but nothing to bad as I'm only a small woman. Delivery came quickly and was easy to track"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Cute clothes all styles, very affordable prices! Many coupons 24/7 (sign up is easy peasy & free!) I've had SheIn for years! Houseware, jewelry, accessories, shoes, and more! I recently got a pair of platformed Converse style shoes for only $17, they're actually great quality and incredibly cute - unlike a lot of platforms, cheap or not, that will tear from the sole immediately. Constant sales + incentives! *IF ORDERING A LOT AT ONCE, it may arrive missing an item or 2, but I don't blame them.*"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Not only are there app only deals but it's easy to use, search, and understand. They are a fashion forward company that has a whole new take on not only web-based retail but retail as a whole. Furthermore the prices are suprizingly low. They take returns as long as long as they are consist qulh"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy online shopping and when I downloaded this app. I could not stop shopping and adding things to my cart! It's very easy to use and look up different products. They give you points and coupons, which I am very pleased with as well. I usually buy all my things from SHEIN now. Yes, some items are cheap and may not last long but as long as it does it's job. I can deal with it. :)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Everywhere on the site it says FREE RETURNS. But then when you click the link to go to return policy it says that it's FREE RETURNS only on your first return off your purchase and that isn't the same as complete Free Return as there are conditions attached. Which doesn't make it completely free anymore. It is misleading because they had to be specific and put down ""Free Return on your first Purchase"" for it to be accurate. This kind of promotion is false advertisement."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Everything was great until one order was wrong. They delivered the wrong item. Then I received a notification that my credit card was hacked and when checking over 1k was stolen from my card from shein. I now have to get a new card. Highly disappointing. !!DO NOT LEAVE YOUR BANK INFO ON THE APP!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Haven't had major issues with the app. However, I noticed only when browsing thru the men's section, it would show some sort of error every once in awhile when I search or click on something specific."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Sizes in shein items are of wide range. I would just love it even more if there are more xs sizes for petite figures like me. The prizes are unbeatable the quality though has still to improve. Transactions are fast and easy and overall this app this recommendable.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am so thankful to Shein, I never like dress but shein has made buying dress easier for me and I get compliments bcs their clothes cater for my body. The cost are reasonable. I can compare clothes on the app until I decide which ones is perfect for me. My closet has change variety of colours at times I take risk buying thing wouldn't buy at our malls. The experience for me is great, I buy at the comfort of my space and shop anytime which is convenient. I hope the quality of their hair is good."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It was amazing a few years back but the quality is terrible now, less unique, the design quality has dropped and the prices went up drastically. What you see is what you get though. The quality was great before and had lower prices. At this point might as well by from regular stores like h&m."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,An app with absolutely ridiculous service. They do not deliver the products neither give any updates on the orders or tracking and there's no support service. May be it's fake.👎 I've been continuously asking for call reservations and trying to chat but there's no response from their end. I don't even know whether they'll deliver my order or not. Never pay your money beforehand because you don't know whether you'll get your product or not. Highly unprofessional!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"App works fast and is easy to navigate, I live it and shein is great, I always order enough to get free shipping, and the constant coupons mean I always get 20% (at least) off my order, plus if you login everyday you get points which is more money off. Great value and great products. Honestly, it really helps when bills are tight Shein is great for when you need to buy presents etc, I buy work jackets and slippers and accessories, kitchen items, etc. It's like a one stop shop."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Closer to 4.5 stars for me. The actual app is easy to use and I find that before ordering anything it's best to look through a few reviews. The app runs a little slow every now and then but that may just be my phone. There isn't always what I'm looking for on here either but that is to be expected I guess. Overall great app with very affordable prices.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Wow! This is like Wish but SO SO much better! And you don't have to wait months to get the stuff you ordered. I don't understand why people aren't freaking out over this. My favorite wardrobe pieces are from Shein! Thank you SO much for making comfortable clothes that fit all shapes and sizes! I will only buy clothes from you now. NOTHING is more exciting then getting a big bag of Shein clothes IINDIVIDUALLY wrapped in their own bag!! It's like Christmas & ur birthday all rolled into one lol 😆
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love shopping with Shein. Such a variety of things to browse and fantastic quality of items with unbeatable prices. A few of my family members and friends now use Shein and are all equally impressed. I don't think I've ever shopped on a site, with so many choices at such fantastic prices, excellent quality and perfect packaging and delivery"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like how the items are arranged in the mobile app but better yet, I love the prices and the selection! I like that I can see the different color offerings on the model before I put the item in my cart as well as the actual size variations so that I can select wisely."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app and prices are decent. The app runs efficiently and its easy to place an order. Orders seem to come fairly quickly and the material is okay for the price. If you buy, be sure to buy a couple sizes up as they do run a little small."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"My experience overall has been very good, but I don't want deliveries to come after 5pm please. The last two times it has happened and I would have to frantically make an arrangement. Other than that, I love the app, the clothing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love the products I've received. The quality has been wonderful and the prices great. I wish I could order my specific choice (color or design for example) of an item vs getting what you get.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Shein is a great online clothing store. Such a variety in clothes and always sales on! Shipping can take up to two weeks but its expected if it's coming from China to the uk. I highly suggest the clothes and you do get what you pay for and more alot of the time! Cant wait to put in my next order!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Well-Made, Flattering Styles at Unbelievably Low Cost A dear friend of mine told me about Shein past yr and, since then, I've revamped a lg portion of my wardrobe @ a FRACTION of the price I was accustomed to. Out of 20+ pieces, only 3 didn't work for me (sleeves were too small). Chat rep offered me a full refund w/o any requirements to return the products, so I passed them on to another friend. Shein is highly recommended for quality clothes/limited budgets"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this shopping app, there is a lot of things you can get for certain occasions. For example I've had a winter formal dance and got a dress from this app. I got the dress exactly how it looked and it was the perfect size."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The sizing is crazy, literally have to read 50+ reviews/pics to get an idea of the size. quality of some of the stuff isnt great could be a totally different material then you expect, maybe 30% of everything I order goes back due to sizing , normally takes around 2/3 weeks for orders to arrive which is manageable but it took over 2months for my return to be refunded , saying that, the prices and verity are great I still love shopping here♥️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Despite the nice products which I like alot. I had problems with points. I ordered, confirmed and reviewd, still did not receive any points. I had this problem with 5 orders and I contacted them immediately with pictures, their answer was sorry we have no control, second time sorry we will added but then NOTHING. Then the points expired!!! I haven't received it at all. All this like more than 5 answers for the same opened case. Contradicting answers, unfulfilled promises and lies."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Love the clothing and shipping is fast for me. I've been using the Shein app for a year now and I'm happy with the quality of the clothing and the prices are great. The only problem I recently encountered was after placing an order every thing was correct and when it arrived the order wasn't correct. There is no way to contact anyone except to send a chat message but the response I received was to contact an agent which can't be done at this time. Better communicate is neccessary.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've ordered about 15 items, and only returned 2, one was to small, entirely my fault, and one was not what I was looking for. But everything else was top notch,I love this app, I'll stay with it as long as it stays reasonable in price. Did I mention how great the prices are!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have ordered a few things from this app. Amazing. Be aware though, read reviews before buying an outfit. They range from being cheap quality to being amazing quality but price does not determine that. I've bought bedding and outfits that are absolutely amazing. Very happy with Shein and how fast my packages come and how easy it is to track my order without worrying. Thanks Shein!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"All that I've ordered and continued to order, have been great quality and looked same as the pictures, there are some unique and beautiful items that I have never been able to get in any stores. I always tell ppl to look online at shein. At work there at least 14 of us that always shop at shein. You won't be disappointed. Give it a try you will be addicted."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I go on shein pretty often. But most of the time I dont have the money to buy anything lol. The only thing they may want to improve on is shipping. If you dont pay and extra 3 or so dollar it could take up to a month to receive your package. Also they have a few items that don't have the best prices.. But other than that they have great clothes.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Sometimes the sizing is incorrect, it's normally bigger than on the site chart. I have had orders with missing items or they've given me a completely incorrect size. You have to read the fine print because it could offer free shipping, but then you end up paying tariffs, which feels kind of unfair. It's a good site to shop on, but it could easily go wrong, thats why I think their support team is so good."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The app is fine but I never received my order which was placed on November 4th and it never arrived. Each time I check its in transit and now I can't even return the items. So this has been the worst experience ever and I was looking forward to receiving the clothes
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The content is great. Very reasonably priced, lots of choice. Shipping is fast and you can track this at every step. Lots of discounts and rewards on the app. I havent bought from any other online retailer since using Shein"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"One of the best online shopping apps. Can order without a second thought, a variety of fashion to choose from. SHEIN gives away check in points daily that can be used for any purchase, unlike other apps, where they give conditions to apply for points. I love shopping from SHEIN as its easy and the products are genuine. I totally recommend SHEIN 😍."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is the greatest e-commerce offering in the retail space for cross-border purchases, hands down. Not only do I LOVE their goods, I can trust the quality, the great service and the sizing is well documented by other customers' reviews - which is great! Just an amazing app! Well Done Shein ⭐"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this store for two reasons. First it has wonderful prices on all sorts of clothing. Second being that I am a full figured woman their sizing chart is pretty accurate. They get close out to you quickly and they offer you 30 day money back guarantee. They also give you opportunities to earn points towards your purchase and coupons. The shipping and handling is very cheap which is rare in today's market. You can't go wrong doing shopping with Shein Fashions❤
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So far so good .I just got the app and what a humongous selection,styles,colors&sizes!! It's great.And reasonable prices! I ordered 6 shirts/blouses for 90 some 90 some dollars.Your first order you a get a pretty big discount.So it was like 80 something.I have yet to receive them but will leave another review when they come . But I suggest anyone who don't know of SHEIN check it out."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I purchase once from shein, six items to be exact, the slippers are lovely, and are true to size, but the pants was way too big, even though the size chart shows my waist size, I ordered a 3x when a 1x seems it would fit; and a lot of people complaining about it. So I'm scared of buying clothes on shein and if I do ill by buying one piece at a time in case it dosen't fit!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Quick and easy use. Some of the stuff that you see on Instagram when you check them with the description provided you don't find them. Is there any other way of searching? Can you write the end date of the sale items. When you have received an item and wrote a review Is it possible to go back and load a picture after submission? Otherwise it is quick and the app is effective
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Absolutely love Shein! One hundred times better than Zaful. Recently started using Shein and it has such a user friendly platform and even the deals and varieties are awesome! You have to spend rs.1800 to get free delivery but thats better then 3700 on Zaful 😓 It takes a lot of time to deliver though but thats okay because the clothes that come are mostly worth it. The points system is also really fun and keeps the customer hooked to the app. Love Shein and would never stop using it ❤️❤️
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is very straightforward. I suggest to measure yourself, and check the measurements on each piece you are interested in, as each are different. Example: I wear anywhere from an 8-22 depending on the actual measurements of the article of clothing. I'm very satisfied!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really like shein, they're stuff is usually pretty good quality. Always read the reviews before purchasing anything though incase it's not what other consumers expected. For the app itself the notifs are annoying sometimes but still useful for telling you if something in your cart or wishlist is out of stock."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Products have always arrived before time. Sizing not always correct though. Dresses I have bought have been good. I bought my husband 3 shirts the same just different colours, but they were all different sizes when they arrived. Returns are easy to do. I used online chat and they were very helpful. I will order more things."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Some unbelievably good deals to be found here. Mostly good quality and plenty of interesting / trendy / unique items that are hard to find in one place. It's hard to describe how vast and versatile the selection of items is. Descriptions are sufficiently detailed (e.g. measurements / material ) so you know what you're getting. Returns are easy in case there is a mistake regarding an order. Definitely recommended.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Loads to choose from and you do plus plus sizes wich is great. It's not just clothes, there is plenty of other items for home, garden I have bought many items. Shipping is OK to, doesn't take too long. I enjoy looking through the app its so addictive. 👌"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The apps is great and purchasing it seem to be easy and quality of it was good. But I only give it a 3 stars because the logistic company Shein is using is always problematic. Returning is not as easy as it seem. So making me very caution in wanting to buy Vs I can buy. So may not be my best choice of purchasing. If only the delivery and collecting for return can be improved. Than shein will be the best.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Personally, I would recommend downloading the app and making a purchase as the quality of the products are great. And there are many ways for you to get great offers and discounts you can earn points by opening the app and checking in which you can apply to your purchases to lessen the costs of the total payment which is cool. However some items appear bigger than they actually are in real life. That's the biggest disappointment."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great prices and quality + all clothing has all dimensions so you can't go wrong with the sizes like using any other shopping app ! Absolutely amazing, I'm really happy with Shain and would recommend it to anyone! You can also find the exact same products like from Amazon but a lot cheaper! Shain is gold I swear!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is the best shopping app ever! The prices is unbelievable and the service outstanding. Always great specials and if you buy a certain amount you get discount and shipment is free! They have such a big variety. It's a must have app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is so easy too use! The items on it are not expensive and free shipping! It takes about 1 week too ship but that is ok with me. If you are a inpatient person this is not the app for you but it is the app for me. You get coupon's a lot, and you get points for buying items on the app! Every dollar is 1 point. I would most definitely recommend this app to people who are patient!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this site. Bought a load of things for my holidays and I am over the moon with every single item. There comfy, fit perfect and for the price omg absolute bargain. You can look every day and there always new lines. Great offers on discount and free delivery. Orders come between 3 to 7 days. Packaging is great reusable zip bags. Can't say enough just wish I earned more money to spend xxxxx"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a great shopping app, with awesome products, prices, discounts and coupons. I shopped twice and will definitely continue to use Shein. I have already recommended it to family and friends who have started to shop already and they are loving the app as well. Absolutely amazing 👏 😍 ❤️ 👌 🙌"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The cutest clothes and really cheap.best app ever😍💘 I had a problem once and I need to cancel an item from my order. I talked with a girl ,she helped me out in 5 minutes tops! She was really friendly and helpful,she made sure that I meant that specific item, the money were back at my account after a couple of days and the rest of my order came in a week as always 😊 (Nottingham UK)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been shopping with Shein for quite some time now and I've always been satisfied. I've never even have to return or exchange an item because everything I've purchased so far from looks exactly like the photo you see on the App, if not better."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Goods always arrive on time and generally fit well. One top l ordered in different colours, same size, was too small and my last order the quality of the jumper was very poor. It may be my imagination but anything with the ""Emery Rose"" label seems small in the same size as general clothing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love the App, the points you can gain which turn into money to spend or put towards future purchases. And most of all I love the products! Everything I have ordered so far has been just like the picture and description and cost friendly! Cant say enough good things about SHEIN!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is glitching. I can't select different colors of products. It won't show the picture. It's just a blank pic that's ""loading"" but the other color never shows up. That's a new issue. Please fix."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Fantastic app , high quality items for less of the price tag so many choices from variety in sizing aswell as being true to size , quick shipping and so easy to use you can get points when you purchase and leave reviews and there is even coupons you can use for purchases , wonderful app would be lost without now"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"My experience has been great HOWEVER, I notice that the app is set up mostly for skinny women. It lures you in with great looking items but when you check it out it doesn't come in normal body sizes. That makes me a bit uneasy. I feel its biased and unreasonable to have all these awesome things showcased and NOT AVAILABLE to normal sizes. There's way more women sizes 14-18 than 6-8. Your most beautiful clothing is in 6-10 not cool. Example: your recent feature of the double breasted pea coat."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very bad experience. First of all it took more than 15-20 days to receive the product. The received products were not of good quality. Hence decided to return the product . They took the products but haven't processed the refund. Now when I'm trying to check the status , it's showing no refund available for this account. Fake app, fake customer service. They loot people with cheap quality clothes. There is no phone number to contact th customer care. They have included stupid chatbot."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Cannot fault the service. Items arrive quickly and always beautifully packaged. Definitely value for money. Read the reviews and see customer pictures to get better idea on sizing. I've not returned anything from my last 4 deliveries. One of my top online shops.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The return policy is worst. I read in one of the reviews that you are not charging return shipping fees if there's a quality issue. but that isn't happening actually. I received such a poor quality track suit for aed 62 n now you'll charge me aed 18 for the return and there's no exchange option provided.. won't recommend this app to anybody due to the return policy. otherwise i like the collection.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I really love Shein. It has almost everything and in affordable prices. Its really a great experience. The app is also easy to use. The delievery time is accurate as well. I am glad I found Shein!!!!! I absolutely recommend this to all... You will not regret!!! Actually it would be really nice if you had bts products and clothes but anyways I love Shein.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,*edited review* instead of criticising Shein I actually tried it! I was wrong. Even though it's not UK based they're quite fast at delivery AND the app works!!! Perhaps it works too well as I've received my second order and it's been excellent from start to finish.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Literally lost a lot of money due to an unexpected and never mentioned customs charge when my package arrived after 2 weeks.. It was the worst online shopping experience ever in my life.. Over the years of buying online every fee for delivery was included or there'd be options to include extra fees.. But not in this case.. So I've lost 5k worth of clothing.. I'm very disappointed because there was no extra efforts in play to eliminate the cause of this.. I wouldn't recommend Shein to anyone!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It says that there is extra discount when ordering in the app. But in fact the prices for the same item are expensiver then when you use a browser. So at the end, it is more or less the same price. Quality of the clothing is acceptable. Price wise it's a scam."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It has a favorite button, which is helpful. I can organize my favorites. There is no limitations to the favorites, so I can go back and purchase things that I hearted. My purchase and deliver hasn't happened as of yet nor the quality and quantity but it will soon. I enjoy the variety of products that they have. I love browsing, this has become my new addiction. I'll update this comment when I get more into it. So far, I'm having fun with it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Cheapest feeling clothes ever. Almost every shirt I bought I so cheap and thin. It's basically transparent. Fits are horrible. Barely look like pictures. And I ordered 12 different things. Like ordering the wish version of what you think your gonna get. Save your money. Spend a few extra bucks and order from literally anywhere else
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,my experience of shopping was amazing... the quality is very good of clothes and you get exactly what is in the picture... they have real photos and reviews of the product which u can check before buyin to get an idea of the product... i have used many shopping apps but this one is definately on top of the list... will shop again from Shein... thank u for a delightful experience...
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love the app and the products they sell !!* The products are of very good quality and their service is great !!* The communication channel can just be improved a bit to make sure a parcel gets through customs. But I would definitely recommend using the app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's the best app, it really is soo easy and useful bc I'm in Europe and it's hard to find a company with such variety and styles of clothes which come to European countries. The delivery is fast too, it only took 3 weeks and they came early. A plus is the codes for discounts which help you save a lot of money and it's easy to get points by playing the daily game or by entering the calendar on a daily basis. Oh and you get points from the things you buy and plus you can see your order any minute"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,All the orders I have made fit to sizes and I just love the variety of fabrics that the clothes comes in and if you look at the measurement guidelines you cannot go wrong with the selecting the correct sizes for you. As long as you order items such as clothes that are suitable for your type of body all is perfect.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I don't exactly know but your app is just blank with spaces and not even one image of clothes!! My internet is way more fast than my girlfriend's reply to my message. Can't view anything and the images are loading. I don't think your server is slow in my country because the rest of my friends can use it without having a single problem. PLS FIX IT!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love Shein!! I was very hesitant at first, the prices looked ""to good"" but it has become my ""Go to"" for fashion and decorating. I have not been disappointed with any of my items, from swimsuits, (I bought 5...but honey they were only $10.00 a suit) to dresses...oh about 9 to 10 to date..oh and the earings..and a few odds and ends for home decorating. High end value for the price. Fabric is top notch with secure stitching. Fit is just as described in the description. Love ya Shein!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Lovely website to order from clothes are great , delivery is fantastic , returns is really easy & customer service tracking etc is excellent, great choice of clothes & i love that you can actually see pictures of of the clothes on people , great choice of clothing & very cheap would definitely recommend ordering from shein 😀"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Excellent app. It gives clear pic of the outfits. Has the most trendy clothes. Fits are normally very true to size. Easy to shop as it gives 👍dimensions unlike other apps😘price range is wide so it fits your budget and style. Awesome . This us the only app I like for western outfits. Overall its fab.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I would absolutely love to give no stars but I can't. Placed an order with express delivery for about 10 items. I received 1 item. I then got an email saying my other items were being sent back to shein and that i had two options. They could try again to send my parcel which would take 12-14 days, or i could have a refund for the items only. They refused to refund my postage as well even though i paid £12 and as 'compensation' gave me a code for free shipping on normal standard postage."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Overall the products are good but your customer service is very awful. I have a problem with my order not being delivered so I have been trying to get answers through your customer service but it only has a fixed set of questions !!! Plus on tracking my order it says reached maximum attempt count but I didn't receive a single call.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Prices are good and shipping is usually earlier than what they say. Some items you need to be careful of because a couple of my orders were flimsy or not exactly right (most earrings). But clothing is perfect every time!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I've bought clothes from here for several years. Many of the sweaters have to be ironed after washing. Many of the sizes are not what they seem. The photos of the ad is misleading often or the items is sold out that is in my size but it will still pop up on my newsfeed on social media as an available item. Otherwise I'm satisfied with at least half of the products. I bought 3 sweater dresses in different colors and they all wrinkled up after being washed one time and they were uneven & twisted.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"All of the products I buy from Shein are wonderful. The clothing fits perfectly. 👌🏼 love it all. I'm currently waiting for 2 more pieces of clothing. One of the things I bought (sunset lamp) is slowly fading. When I plug it in, it's not as bright as it used to be, unless I move the cord in a certain way. Which is weird, but other than that, I love Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Shein is the best! I get my orders on time. No issues. The app is easy to nagivate . ive never needed to speak with a customer service cause everything is so smooth. Their products are the best good quality. I have no issues with shein
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Ordered stuff and I must say, being in the curve section, everything fitted perfectly. I've never purchased stuff from anywhere online before without having to send 75% of the clothes back for a refund. Everything was delivered promptly and Shein clothing was very reasonably priced. Love it"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app so much!! I get to see new fashionable clothing and the product is all 100% real and the material product is amazing!! Plus the points are all in USD dollars, and I'm an unemployed student which helps me to purchase the product a bit easier.. Definitely recommended for everyone to use this app!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Such a brilliant choice of clothes so different from other sites, unusual designs, easy return iff not satisfied. Have bought quite a few items, is great that you can look at reviews from other buyers getting there opinion on things is very helpful in choosing sometimes."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Most clothing quality is great, prices are great too. The app works perfect and there are usually always coupons. However, sizing on each item of clothing is different and shipping is a bit long."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have had good experience so far with shein, the clothing mostly is good quality though there are a few you have that tshirt material is usually not the same as ours. But that isn't all the time. The kids shoes are adorable an I have purchased a few pairs, sizes and quality so far been excellent. For the prices you really cannot moan. There is something for everyone all at great prices. And you get great deals on postage which makes a huge difference."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My 15 year old is still waiting on her delivery after three weeks. Tracking still says in transit after April 8 and states item was returned because of bad address. However, my address shows at correct. I've had pre ious deli was from this site and no issues. I can't get in touch with anyone. If I don't received by item by the middle of this week I'm asking for a refund."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a really good shop, however my only complaint is that for plus size (and also regular), they need to have a more diverse cup sizing list. There are a lot of things that I get, even when I order up a size or two, the cup size barely changes. My cup size is not crazy huge, so I think I there should be options for people who above C and regular D cups. Other than that, this site is super fantastic, and I'm always recommending it to my friends. They have a lot of diverse styles."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love shein, its affordable, best quality, latest fashion. I didn't expected they will provide such good quality at affordable price. They gives you best deals/offer and also the free trial lucky draw. We can earn points in several ways. The only drawback is delivery time 7 to 10 days but it doesn't matter if you are getting your trendy choice stuff."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am so disappointed. I use to LOVE this app. so much. even recommended it to some friends. but the last order I placed was processing for over a month! so, I was really confused. and when I tried to contact them, there was no way to talk to anyone. so I set up an appointment for them to call me over the phone. and they never did! will not be ordering from here again. I am BEYOND pissed off. screw you shein!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Loads of options, easy to shop and narrow down. I like that I can keep a wish list or items in my cart and then purchase them when free shipping or good discounts become available. All notifications are in the app so no need for heaps of emails."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love the Shein Fashion Shopping, have done several shopping online so far and have received all my orders. The great thing is that you can always track your order to see how far it is. The clothes are exactly how I saw them advertised. A person just need to make sure they make the right measurement to ensure they receive the correct size. So far so good and will keep on ordering. The fashion is unique, beautiful and great quality. Thank you Shein, expect my 100th order tomorrow 🥳😅"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"To Shein...you're the best. Thank you! Every item from clothing, coats/jackets, shoes, boots and jewelry I'm enjoying the look. Quality of your product is excellent. Shein has everything you’re looking for. Always has sales and the quality of clothing is excellent. I’m so pleased to have found Shein this my go to place for all my essentials I need. Thank you Shein"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love SHEIN and never had a problem. A shipping mistake was causing a bit of stress but this was not from their end. They took care of the problem immediately!!! Thank you !!! I have been buying items with great prices and they get to me in a decent time. They are made from great materials and the jewelry looks great without killing a budget!!!😉
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I find the cutest clothes on here! I always get compliments on everything I order from clothes for my 1 year old son, 3 year old daughter and myself! Highly recommended them. Fast and easy delivery. Returns you have to pay for shipping but it's worth it if you buy a lot and need to return more than 1 thing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's not the app that is bad, it is the company. They make it look like they have an actual customer support, but no matter where you click you never actually get through to anyone. I tried to get a refund on a swimsuit because they sent the wrong size. But yet it doesn't allow you to click on refund for swimsuits because they are not returnable. But it's their fault because they sent the wrong size. I've never been so frustrated with a company."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! I love everything about it! I love the reasonable prices and how they have everything you would need and want. When you're ready to check out, it will give you discounts and coupons with a percentage off that will give you a chance to order just one item you want! It also shows the rating on the item as well as previews of who ordered(rating the item they purchased), which makes it more interesting."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,They have a lovely variety of clothing. I don't have issues in what I want to find or what I am looking for. Sometimes there is size issue where some items are not as they seem to be in the picture and description. Very rarely I have ordered from here and had to return items. Most likely everything is OK. Just love how in one app you can find all different types of clothing
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is just so good! I love it, first off, it has so many articles of clothing and so many options to choose from, it even has categorized clothes, second off, it doesn't just have clothes, it has all kinds of stuff, phone cases, hair things, body stuff, and more! I love this app. The one thing that bothers me is that it takes kind of a long time to get to the house, as If I would put the rating down because it's already so good."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Wide variety of items sold on this app at extremely low prices. Good member rewards and fun games to earn points. Read the reviews of the items before you buy because the quality can be poor at times. Other than that, its a great app to shop for all things fashion, home, pets, and so much more."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I had bad experience up on online shopping. After that I didn't use online shopping. But one day I saw a beautiful long dress which was wearing by one of my friends, on that day she recommended me about SHEIN. I was very glad to give her thanks cordially after getting some orders from SHEIN. It is very reliable, most of the products are same as pictures and descriptions in the advertisement. Now I'm happy with this online. I have so many items from SHEIN."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Prices are really good, postage makes your store an attractive choice. Clothes are mostly reasonable to great quality, a few items were poorly made though. Sizing is not consistent unfortunately, i need to check the size measurements for every clothing item. Ive bought earrings, clothes, a few household things. I enjoy your store and the range is surprising!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"5 stars, no words. This app, has every style you could find (you just need to say the right name for it). Something(s) you could add: fake teeth for Halloween Halloween cosplaying. I've been trying to find some of these for ages, but couldn't. Or maybe I typed wrong. But, great shopping app! Tip: if you want to find the style, let's say... Aly style! (gothic) Just type the right name. Because maybe its a nickname? But just- great app. Awesome."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like it! And it gives lots of good deals! I order at least £20 every month! Just one thing, though - I would prefer if it was able to make some of the vouchers lower prices, or at the very least give more time. Most of them are useless to me as I mostly spend £20 and max £30."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"From what I can see on the website, the clothes are phenomenal! I love how much they cater to plus size women, most online stores don't have a big selection that's appealing. My manager actually referred me to this site, and everything that she's bought so far looks great! The quality is A+ for a reasonable price, and I love the flash sales!! I just ordered quite a few things and I can't wait for them to arrive!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's not a complicated app but it's not friendly either. Same images appear again and again when browsing... Quality and comments accepted on the feed are not of the best quality.. Exact same comments also appear more than once in the same feed....
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, however a few of the cheaper things you can buy are quite poorly made, but tbh that's expected, on the other hand, things around £10 and up are really quite well made, and I'm very happy with practically all my perchesed items, it has a great range of style, trust me from someone with a very odd style, there is deffinetly something for everyone!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I buy clothes on Shein all of the time. I love the items I've purchased. Although they do have a good return policy. The items always come very quickly (in the time predicted) and most items fit well and are super cute!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Fantastic, absolutely love the products and the service. Super easy to search for specifics and a phenomenal selection. Only place ill buy my lingerie and ive never had a problem with size. I did have a lacey bralett with a missed seam connecting the strap, but to be fair it was easily fixed by myself and its still one of my favorites."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely awful! Technical issues resulting in certain letters aren't accepted so can't enter correct billing or delivery details. Contacted support and told to wait 48 hours and then see if it's still an issue, if so contact them again... No I'll take my money to a company that has better customer service!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They do not post my negative product reviews or photos. Only the positive. Points are not received if the review is negative. Often items are not as pictured. Sizing is bizarre and inconsistent. Delivery times frequently change to later dates after items are purchase. Tracking has never once been accurate. Really, zero stars from me."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My daughter told me about this site. I love the low price good quality of clothing. Although I have yet to give reviews on the clothing, I have purchased several dresses for myself and a wardrobe for my granddaughter. She just loves the clothes. There were a couple dresses that fit too close so we use them for something to wear under other clothes. I myself had only one dress that did not look good on me. I was able to send back and get a fast refund. No hassles. I will definitely buy again."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Generally excellent - prices are very competitive, shipping is very cheap or free, product range is always superior to others with comparable stock, delivery is swift and before date given. Customer service is easy to access and use to make any returns etc. No hesitation in recommending."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app. Functions well. Clothing is good quality for the price. Fits true to size. A great mix of trendy, comfy, office & spicy items. They have more than just club/video h@# wear. If you're plus size this is a great place. For Shein plus doesn't only mean big butt, little waist. Real customer pics wearing items and on-time delivery are a bonus."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Its SHEIN, so when downloading you know you're getting SHEIN website in app form. It does exactly that & it seems to work great! I can make purchases simple, I can save to my boards easily & it does pretty good with the notifications, though the number a day reduced would be nice."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great App for all sorts of things. I am very cautious of the clothing as I have had a few experiences where the items are smaller than the size advertised, however I did not double check the measurements. Household and interiors items are good, cushion covers are my current favourite."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I like the app. It's user friendly and pretty easy to use. It allows tracking of an order from beginning to end and provides timely notifications which is good. Love the rewards point system that's in place too
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pls dont partner with njv logistic. They really have bad reputation in shipping and they took long when delivering orders. I love shein cause the items were pretty and affordable. I also love the point system and I save a lot because of it. Other thing I find not good is that they dont restock most of the items which are extremely popular and best seller. Another problem is the logistic company that delivers my order. I really hate nvj, hope youre not having them anymore."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Do not download this app. after having it for a few weeks credit karma notified me that there had been a data breach and that my personal info was in danger. when i checked who was behind the breach it was SHEIN. My password had been exposed by them. Deleted app immediately. Luckily that was the only place that I used that password.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Loved the stuff I purchased! Good quality at a great price! Fast shipping! Large variety of products. I've purchased made multiple purchases over the years. I love their bathing suits, clothes, house decor, kids clothes etc... My 7 yr old granddaughter downloaded it to her iPad & has a list of fidget toys, make brushes, novelty items & some clothes. She loves SheIn too!! You will love whatever your purchase."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love the variety, but I wish that the plus size had the same options in clothing and not something similar. Or more conservative I'm a big girl, yes but it does not mean i have to dress like I'm forty. I see cute thing on here but it is only in smaller sizes. In my opinion FASHION NOVA does way better in size range....just to put that out there."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Such cute dresses with varying styles to work for everyone. The sizing charts are accurate but you have to look at measurements every time. The sizes are not the same every time. I bought a Medium that was still a little big to a 0X so watch the sizing!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love this app, besides shipping charges are high. And if by chance the article doesn't fits you or anything the return charge is also to be paid by customer's pocket so it just leads me to use it at last if i dont find anything good at other apps. You really need to look at it. But I love the collection ❤️ unique and trendyyy"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm addicted to Shein! I love so many things, clothing especially. They have wonderful little gadgets that are helpful for home and auto. I order something every month. The clothing is great quality for the price. The prices are amazing. They're shoes are fantastic. I have many, and several pairs of boots and I'm very satisfied with every single pair! I'm a bodysuit fanatic! I've gotten so many wonderful ones from SheIn. I don't shop anywhere else. 😊😁"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Overpriced. Simply just too expensive. One can find better deals elsewhere with a fraction of the price they've placed on each item. Overpriced to a great extent. Definitely not recommendable.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I got one good outfit and the rest was just poor quality. Obviously you get what you pay for. I wish shipping didn't take so long. I advise getting things worn by the models. That's the only good outfit I got the rest weren't on a model and they were poor quality. The jewelry is surprisingly decent tho!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I always get what I'm looking for. Shein caters for my whole family. I love the different styles of clothing available. The flash sale prices are so low the only problem with the flash sale is the amount of items u can buy. I even love the kitchen stuff and jewellery available. The prices on regular items are also affordable. I even got my daughter, son and husband addicted to buying from Shein. The delivery time for shipping to our country is so fast. I prefer to buy from Shein than locally."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app sends out wayyy to many notifications. 🙃 I purchased a week or so ago and while the experience was good it's tainted by constant app reminders AND emails to tempt me to purchase again, seriously 😳 Had to uninstall because I can't be bothered. Will reinstall when I want something again, not when I'm bombarded"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app I've ordered 4 times of Shein so far from bedding to clothing and makeup the sheglam range is amazing the quality of the clothing I have found is on the thin material side but what you get for the price is great. It has the after pay option for me which on a single income is perfect. Shipping time I have found to be excellent can't fault it so far and you can track your order from start to finish. Highly recommended Shein Love love love it.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I am going with 2 stars because I was unsatisfied with the sizing. I ordered a few items for myself and some for my girlfriend. I actually couldn't of been happier with the things I purchased for myself and if I were only going off my own experience, I'd rate this much higher! My girlfriend had a lesser great experience than I did so I would only do 2 stars since this is mostly an app used by females. The sizing isn't accurate and the availability of some sizes isn't the best. Great prices."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Was a bit skeptical using the app from past experience with other companies, I'm glad I gave it a try!!!! I'm loving the mini games (although I haven't won anything) and the site is easy to navigate and I'm better able checking my orders and their status!!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I LOVE shopping for anything and everything on SHEIN! It is priced well, there is a wide variety, most thing are good quality and the few thing i have bought that were not good quality were at least very cheap so I did not mind. The make up is worth trying because you can get some really great products....I love the ash color eyebrow kit, it matches my natural brows better than any other brand i have tried and i have tried most of them."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's a nice app with cheap clothing that usually don't feel low quality, but you get what you pay for. There's a high probability your order will have holes. Also, there's been this weird film on the clothes lately. It's a little concerning. It comes off in the wash, but I don't think it should be on there in the first place."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Everything I've received has been great! I love that they have the measurements listed for each size since they can differ as well as reviews and photos from actual people - makes choosing an item and size easy. Shipping is surprisingly fast and returns are also easy.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Everything good about shopping online in one easy app. True to size clothing and cute cheap accessories.. good quality overall very satisfied with purchases and timing. It's about a two week wait for your items. I bought close to 100 items from this app. I highly recommend for plus size women as well.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The app worked nice before this update. Now everything is messed up.. i asw able to delete stuff directly from my wishlost but now its such a mess. Another thing is that when i tap to any product in my cart while returning back the screen goes to starting of the cart . Hate the new update . Lots of bugs.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,something is definitely off because some of the reviews can be very bad but they'll still be 5 stars?? or they'll be way too good and hype up the product and when you get it it's just alright and once you review something you can't even edit or or add onto it which is really weird and annoying their jewelry and stuff is really nice it's not high quality but nice and very very cheap
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm addicted. When you go to your cart, they show you perfect options for if you want to accessorize your outfit! I found a cherry print dress and felt as though something was missing, but shein paired it with a gold chain headband and I fell in love with it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love Shein, the quality is great and I'm always happy with my items. The sizing is pretty good and it also helps that other people can share photos so you can sort of visualize what it can look on you. I've bought clothes, bed sheets household items makeup. So i highly recommend SHEIN."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love the sales and price. Mind blowing! Also a fun places to shop. Only down fall is it takes awhile for them to ship your order out. But for the prices of the item I can over look that. Can't wait for my first order to come! Eeeeekkkkk
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's never a dull moment using this app. I search, find and buy beautiful plus size clothing, accessories etc. Its a really great app and you should download and tell a friend to tell a friend....You also get coupons, points notifications and other notifications.. You will never miss out on great deals. ❤❤❤❤❤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Well, let's just say Shein is my new favorite online shopping site. I can honestly find everything that I am looking for on this site. They are always having some sort of flash sale, free shipping, etc. Other sites simply don't compare to Shein. My go to sites before Shein were Kohls, Macy's, Old Navy just to give you an idea. Happy shopping at SHEIN!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I haven't ordered yet, but it takes me an hour to decide what I want at a restaurant and this company has so much more than a restaurant!! It's like every food you've ever thought of cooked every way with every condiment! They have great sales and coupons on top of low prices!!! You get a good idea of how something will fit you using the filter on the reviews of an item! Select your size and find someone of a similar height and weight as you and you'll have an idea of how it will look on you!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is literally the best app i downloaded ever! 😌It has anything you nees from clothes, accessories, decorations for your home, even for pets!! 😍In the best prices possible, you get coupons, codes and points to add discounts to your purchases. It has tones of reviews on the items you want to buy so you can get a closer look. Most importantly it has any size you need. I love shein i have ordered many times and im always pleased with the results 🎉❤️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Shein has lots of great items at great prices and you'll be happy with your purchases IF they actually send you everything that you purchase. I know people myself included who don't order from them anymore because they didn't deliver, kept the items, and customer service was a damn joke! PROCEED WITH CAUTION!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My new favorite place to get clothing, lingerie, and jewelry. Their sales are the best. Shein is cheaper than other clothing stores and the quality is pretty good for the cost. Their selection for women is endless but they should add more for men. I'd shop for my boyfriend if their men's clothes were cheaper and had more selection."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM THEM! They will take your money and then take their sweet time getting the product to you. When try to get in touch with customer service to figure out what is going on, you get the runaround and they close the ticket without resolving it. Just bad business practices or top of cheaply produced clothing. Not worth the money."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Got a lots of dress 👗 and tops. But then I still can't get the size correct. So end up most of the clothes I give it to my friends cos size big and some small. Sad! Sometimre pictures of the tops and dresses also plays a part. I choose so carefully . .. overall all nice outfits... 👍👍 Hats off.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The last few weeks I've became addicted, friends and my daughter were wearing really cute clothes for a big savings. When I asked where they bought, they'd say, Shein. I am so glad I found the site, not only nice things for myself but! Love shopping for my 7 year old daughter! There is no reason not to dress in style!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Exactly what you expect. I don't think I've ever paid more than $10 for a single item, and while the fabric is cheap, it lasts longer than I'd expect, fits better too. Some of it might not be perfect for regular wear(really inexpensive leather bustier, for example) but you get what you pay for, and it's pretty much exactly what you see in the pic. This has been 10/10"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I keep coming back! Low prices, and overall decent quality. The only complaint I have is the shipping takes a little longer, but it is never a secret- buyer is made aware of shipment time during check out. The app/site has an option to upgrade shipment time though 😊"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The app is good but would be great if it could keep the points for a long time (I was saving for a while and it dissappeared) and if we could divide the saved items into sections and receive notifications when the three saved item is low in stock.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love it!! Easy to navigate and great products, shipping usually takes 2 to 2.5wks. Lots of coupons so your items are always discounted and arrive in good condition. I have not had any problems with the app or the service so far thank goodness 🙂👍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This experience was very bad. I payed over $150 to get free shipping but a week later they send a random email from DHL saying we need to pay an extra $47 for taxes, fees and delivery. Even though on the website they said it would be FREE. I am disappointed because they did not warn me at checkout that i will have to pay this too."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Love the app. Exceptional!! ♡ BUT RETURNS RULE NOT CLEAR ENOUGH & SHOULD BE IN CAPITALS TO STAND OUT!!! PLEASE CHANGE. I didn't see it. So wouldn't have bothered buying the item. Due to money issues. I ordered a bra expecting to be able to exchange if it didn't fit. Knickers i accept not to, but a bra I don't understand why not. Now I am left with 2 new bras that don't fit me & can't afford to buy the bra again now for another month."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I find the app easy to use, it gives me alerts if something I have on my wishlist is about to go out of stock or has come back in stock. It lets you preselect your size or measurements and will remember it for things that are in stock! I didn't download it for ages and now regret that looking back, it's so much easier!! ❤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,NO COMPLAINTS! I'm able to track my orders & SHEIN does a great job shipping orders out fast! I enjoy all they have to offer along w/their great prices...good quality of clothing at an affordable price...you can earn points to use towards purchases...flash sales & if you use the sizing charts they've been pretty accurate. Oh & they offer free returns in the U.S. I'm new to SHEIN & very happy I discovered them.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Overall I love it! Have to check the ratings and reviews on each thing you order to get the right size and know quality but as far as fashion, it's the best place I have found for work clothes. Plus the price makes it even better. Even if I end up with one outfit I don't like, u always end up with 6 I do. Price makes it totally worth the risk of not loving them all."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"SHEIN keeps failing at the payment. I've ordered from them many times before, I have funds to pay for the clothes in my account but it keeps rejecting it. It say to contact support but I can't find a contract us anywhere on the website, it's really aggravating!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love everything about it. Except how the bathing suit bottons and shorts show a little more than I would like. The only bikini bottoms that dont show a lot of cheek are the high waisted ones and I dont like high waisted things. The blue jean shorts are a little too short for my taste but some of them are a really great and the perfect length.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Product got to me faster than the expected date so that was a plus! You can add things to your wishlist to save for later. I just recommend reading reviews before buying clothing bc the sizes are off a bit sometimes. But overall great experience!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great products and great prices. Its easy for the cart to pile up quick. Finding the right size is a little complicated but the reviews help u figure it out . Shipping can take a little longer than expected but it's worth the wait.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app! Easy nav, loads fast, and has a clean layout. I love how easy the favorites feature is to use right from the search results. It seems like new items are added every day, so it's always fun to browse!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"There's nothing more that I can say besides I love this app. I've been ordering from Shein for the last year. Though I've had some sizing issues with the bras, everything else has been spot on. I'm currently waiting on a large summer order for everyone in my house and it's all arriving within 2 weeks like every order before this one. I will definitely keep ordering from Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Pretty good. It's a clean app, which makes it easier to search and find what you want. The prices are awesome considering the quality of the products, and I can compare them without much effort to find what fits better for me. I don't know who made this happen, but congrats, it's currently one of the best shopping apps we have."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The clothing is great. I have ordered a few clothes and lots of bathing suits and loved them. The only thing I haven't been very happy with is the home stuff. The plastics and sticky part then to be cheap and not work well. The reviews and pictures of people wearing the clothes is a great part of being able to pick good clothes out.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,So far I've love the two out of three I bought. The third was a size to big my fault and shein refunded me and let me keep then jeans so if I gain weight I have an extra pair. I am looking forward to my second order and will continue to review. Also love the prices so low and cheap but quality items. Its nice when you live two hours away in any direction from the closet Walmart target or malls.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love shein, every item i have purchased has met my expectations above and beyond. I love the fact that i can track my orders every step of the way from the moment i place it to the moment i receive it. And i actually have been receiving my orders a couple weeks earlier than estimated. The quality is good and sometimes i even get free shipping. And they always have discount coupons, plus you earn points that you can use towards your next purchase. YOU ALSO GET SOME PERKS ! TRY IT OUT"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Was hesitant to order from Shein, unsure what the quality would be like looking at the prices but I was more than pleasantly suprised. Ordered well over 40 items now and been very happy with the quality and fit of 99% of items purchased. Takes a few weeks to arrive under standard shipping so not ideal if you need anything super quick but I'd definitely recommend the company to others."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Everything's great with this app. The clothing is great. (well most of it) The products are good too. If I had to choose one issue that I have it would be returning items. Just wish it was a little easier to do so. Other than that if you haven't shopped or used SHEIN yet you are seriously missing out! Once you start SHEIN you will not stop! It'll definitely be your go to new addiction!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely ❤️ Shein. The app is very user friendly & the store offers amazing products for home, fashion, pets, accessories, etc. The prices are absolutely amazing & definitely competitive. I have had a great experience thus far."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great options, but please give better discount deals for Fiji. I'm not able to get further discount vouchers then the regular $10, $20, and $35. I'm sure you can give better deals than that in % like you do for other countries"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"worst experience,Returning process is worst than other. Cloths were same kind as you will receive from flipkart or amazon. No proper customer care intraction. Item was missing from my purchasings but still they charge for returning. Club Factory service is much better than this. I want my refund. after getting refund I will unistall this app. WORST EXPERIENCE."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Customer Service is terrible if you have any issues. I have been trying to get a refund for items that were not delivered since July 2022 and still have not received it. Aside from that I love all the items I have received. (ADDENDUM) Just to clarify as I received the comment below. I have contacted cx service and I have months of documented back and forth with them refusing to provide my refund and repeating the same thing verbatim that are invalid. This started in JULY and it is DECEMBER!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I ordered for the first time . Had to return two items cause of the size. Didn't get the refund till now. It's been a month now. While talking with the customer care, they said to contact my bank as they have already refunded a month back but I didn't receive anything as yet. Bank said, they want a mail from shein that the amount has been refunded and when I try to call customer care, it's always busy or nobody is available. I want my money back. This is really disappointing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great functionality, but the App could be more intuitive, by suggesting items similar to those that were viewed / purchased or which is more in line with the filters that were applied (e.g. if a user does not view tight, revealing clothing, why add them to the suggested items?)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the quality and the price of majority of the items I bought on this app. I wish that most of the beautiful dresses would have a longer version and the splits would not be so high, showing so much legs and back would not cut so low"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely devastated, I was meant to get $750 worth of credit, I've done everything that wish is asked me to do! Playing games and paying for them it said it would only take up to about 5 days to complete!! It's been over 2+ months So I spent so much money on buying things on wish thinking I would get credit back and I have got nothing so disappointed 😫😞😪"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Everytime I get an order, it's broken or missing an item. And several times an item was changed by someone within the company to a different size without my knowledge making me spend money on something I was unable to use and unable to send back because the return fee is often more expensive than the item bought. I've submitted tickets with customer service with documentation but as stated before, the return fee for returning a broken item to be replaced is more than I actually paid 4 said item"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My first order. Interesting shopping, so many things to choose, great selection of varied items. Order process very easy, good delivery time considering the item has travelled from another country, it arrived earlier than expected. I have a post box address, unfortunately the courier was unable to deliver to a postal box, but it was not a problem as I was contacted by phone and met with the driver, which was great to receive my parcel. Very happy with purchase and my first experience with Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I purchase many things from Shein every month. Things are very reasonably priced and the quality quite good. I enjoy the special discounts they have very often. I must say I am always encouraged to purchase a lot more than I originally planned. I really enjoy shopping on this site.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love it quick fast reasonable and affordable. Only issue is that some of the materials are very thin.but its effective reliable and efficient. I recommend shein anyday. It make shopping easier for those who once thought they couldn't shop online.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Addictive! Shein has tons of items to choose from. Shipping is pretty quick too. Make sure to follow the size chart for every item. It is fun for shopoholics because it is a very affortable way to buy trendy styles.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is great, works really well and the notifications aren't over the top. Really nice clothing for every style and budget! Just order in advance cause it can take a while to arrive."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really do love SHEIN.. but it's been quite frustrating lately. Never had this problem before, but today as I was trying to place an order, an ""unknown error"" would keep popping up, preventing me from purchasing. I've tried different cards, none work (and no, there aren't any problems with my cards or my financial accounts). My app is up to date, still I wonder if it's a bigger system bug, since I also tried placing the order through the browser on my pc, but ended up with the same problem."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Outstanding! Shein covers a wide array of items, household to handbags. Their clothes are fabulous, they are the current styles and colors at a fraction of the cost. Your not just a customer either, you become part of the Shein Community, with videos on outfits, challenges, contest for points. Members will eagerly help you with a outfit choice. I ADORE Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Has affordable and good quality clothes. The application is also fast and easy to use. After purchasing clothes, the shopping doesn't take time and you sometimes get free shipping. I love the application and you can also get discounts and many promo code."

I just received my first order and I loved all of my pieces. I would suggest reading item reviews before your purchase. I will definitely order again."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love Shein and find myself ordering from here all the time! The app is absolutely fantastic and rewards you! You constantly get money off your orders through coupons and it's fantastic. I highly recommend following their Instagrams because they always hold competitions where you can win gift cards!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"They take to long to ship and always ship through ups who is horrible at updating you. As much as I like the styles and everything I will not be using it much in the future. They're ""customer support"" is virtual robot and you can't really connect with anyone."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's a great app for easier shopping. You can find literally anything on there but shipping takes extremely long and is also expensive. The clothes that I receive are good quality and overall it's a good app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Almost everything is like the picture and everything is great quality. About everything is true to size but if you're not sure than you can check the reviews. It'll take about a week or two to deliver but during that time they are making sure it's the best it can be so when you get it it's worth the wait.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"All in all this is a great app, the only ads or from the website and aren't very common so not bother! In addition the prices are incredible and the shipping is very good for an online company seeking things for so cheap. They are also very good quality products so would highly recommend!!!! 💜💜💜"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,My friend recommended me this app & I'm so fkn glad she did. I've made an order almost every Sunday (bc that's free shipping day) since she told me about it a month or two ago. 😆 They have literally just about everything need from clothes to jewelery. nail art supplies to everything seasonal. Stickers & shoes & everything you can possibly imagine for CHEAP. & most everything I've got has been great quality. I definitely recommend checking out this app! 💜
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"That's for real the best app to purchase clothing items and other pretty stuff. Pricing is affordable and the app is so organized and easy to navigate. They have great coupons as well and gathering points is actually useful here, plus free shipping is amazing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love SHEIN!! Was very scared to order clothing from over seas because of sizing and quality. A lot of clothing & shoes that look awesome but the quality is very sketchy and sort of looks like the item you originally saw. Not with SHEIN! IT IS AS YOU SEE! Follow the sizing charts and you won't be disappointed! Quality fabrics & craftsmanship! 💗💗💗SHEIN!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Big variety of clothes and not expensive at all. Most of the clothes are true to their size just check reviews etc. :) some items feel super cheap but duhh what do you expect when you buy something for 5 euros. Shipping really fast so thats fantastic as well.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I discovered Shein about 6 months ago. I received the items so well packaged. The only issue are the sizes. I read the measurements and select the size from that info. When I received the clothes are so much bigger than the description. The have to improve the reviews because there are a lot that do not describe the ítem, are songs, poems, or emojis. It would be great if Shein delete the reviews that are spam, they do not deserve any points."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The first order was great, and although sizing was far bigger than on the website, I can tie up the shirts anyways so no big deal. I then bought clothes for my son and loved them on him, and then for the third purchase got some long sleeved shirts for myself and some for my husband. It was like a totally different quality than the first shipment. Like cheap Halloween costume look and feel with my shirts to thinly made cheap fabric for my husband. Will not buy here anymore."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"You advertise curvy/plus size clothing but there is no difference in the two as far as sizing. Also, not enough true plus size items US 22,24, 26, 28 unless of course u want to look like ur wearing a tent. Who designs these clothes? ""TRUE"" wrap, as well as a line dresses are a great option for plus size women... BUT PLEASE MAKE AN OPTION FOR WOMEN WITH LARGER BREASTS!! I have ordered so much via the app and based on your measurements, but nothing fits with the exception of maybe 3 or 4 pieces."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's really amazing fashion shopping store. I am really happy to do shopping in SHEIN. quality of the clothes are really amazing tqqqqq so much for best clothes with different and many choices .Very pretty dresses , cute caps , wonderful shoes mostly I love the shoes because they are many different choices ."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I give the app a 4 because the links click quickly and the sizing charts really have help with ordering the correct sizes. It's fun to Surf and they have just about everything. However when it comes to the sizing filters, clear return process and knowing what is or is not eligible for the coupons before submitting an order I would give it a 3 star review. Also they do not let you block either text or email notifications without suspending your deals and for that they get a one-star review"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've brought things from SHEIN before, my only critiques are that most of the items feel cheaply made and most designs are stolen from other creators. I like the concept though and have had no problems when it comes to shopping."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Alot of clothing styles to choose from with no lag time when placing orders. Lots of discounts and incentives and an easy return process if you're not liking or fitting thee style. I especially like their size guide.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I want to say I'm very happy I found this site and very very happy with all my choices of clothing. I'm going on vacation soon and can't wait to wear all my new outfits. Every piece I selected was true to size only 2 pieces were a little big but easy fix my mom will take care of that but overall I have not sent any pieces of clothing back. Keep up the great work and the materials are great. Thankyou 👍 ❤️
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Gave one star because they wouldn't allow 0. Bad customer service if you can find a phone number that works for them. They purposely keep the contact number hidden so you can't resolve anything. Customer service constantly lies to you. Developer wrote a reply just go on the app and submit a ticket. I tried to submit a ticket. It refreshes back to FAQ. So you can't submit a ticket. See what I mean.... Lies. See how they weren't interested in finding out information. Just submit a ticket.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love shopping here! They have everything you can imagine for every style, soft, grunge, artsy and so much more! Although, some of their products are terrible quality, and see through, but you get what you pay for."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"East to use, and I love the clothes. Can't complain. The one thing I wish they'd add which would make the app perfect would be to make it possible to share your wishlist to others. Just makes its more ideal and easier to give people ideas for such as Christmas or birthday presents."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great quality items and clothes especially the kids section and accessories. I've ordered lots of times on here and the delivery has always been quick. I'm so impressed with the frequent vouchers, it always makes me come back rather than shopping elsewhere. I also love that the search can be as specific as you need it to be, it's like browsing you're favourite isle in a shop. Update: Fast forward to 2023 the prices keep changing at the checkout...what's happened? You also lost my parcel."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is really amazing and I have no problems with it so far. The quality of the clothes are amazing and the different options are just so amazing but one problem is that some currencies aren't there and it is really hard for me to convert this currency to another, I would really love if there was a NAD currency"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Im regular customer to Shein every month i ordered from them. I suggest all catogeries of clothes but don't go to the furniture or kitchen ware is not a good choice. The clothes is realy good im in love with jacket tops and also always Im getting real size. In additional 2 times i returned back the items it took time but a least they took back the item and give me my money back. I stared ordering from shein 2 years ago. I will keep ordering from them if they stayed in the same level...
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My first experience was good with shein...but second time I ordered the clothes were of cheap quality and they tore very easily...and as for the very recent order my payment was deducted from my account and the order got cancelled....the customer service team is very poor...delayed replies or no replies at all...the robot reply for the Facebook is very useless and I now have to accept the fact that I lost my 182 bucks for nothing....
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very consumer friendly, love that you can get feedback from customers with pictures on bodies other than the models, you getter a better idea of products and clothes from reviews of the consumers. Very slow and unresponsive delivery around festive season from Buffalo logistics, other than that, I love Shein. Oh yes, sometimes the material of some garments feel a little cheap, so dont forget to read reviews first."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have found a new best friend in fashion that matches my idea of what women curves should feel like; the array of styles and classic retro makes it easy to blend my own personal style. Not a cookie cutter one size should fit all lable. Thank you, Monica B."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The shopping bag dumps all of your items if you go back during the payment process and also it doesn't allow you to pay with a card with a different billing address as the shipping address. Very annoying!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I had high expectations from this site but it's the epitome of disappointment. Plz don't purchase anything from this app because they'll only cause a lot of inconvenience to you, the customer. They're not customer-centric. They deliver products which are of the lowest quality. Thereafter, when you request a return and refund, they'll take you for a toss. It has been over 10 days since my return was picked and I haven't yet received my refund. Customer service is as pathetic as their products!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Getting around is so easy and painless. SHEIN always gets your order right the first time, evertime. So much variety in products and styles. Shipping time has improved as of late. I'm impressed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this shop. Clothes are fairly cheap and usually decent quality. Some stuff you get what you pay for but when you want cute clothes without high dollar cost, this is the place to shop. I haven't been disappointed yet!! And I've done a lot of shopping through here."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good looking clothes, good prices and all. but I'm a 14 year old girl looking for some clothes for my first year of high-school. I find cute tops, but every time i find a top I like it's a crop top. that for one will not be allowed by my family and for two its not allowed by schools, I should not have to find shirts in the men's because all I can find are crops. If your going to make clothes make it so people like me can wear what they like and be comfortable in it"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very bad, couple orders I made with them and the very last order I purchased didn't received although they claim I did just cause it says delivered but there's no way they can be sure it got delivered to the correct person or in the right address. I spoke to customer service and denied a refund nor sending the package again. So money lost with them. Good in prices n products but lame delivery service can't be worried every order to actually be delivered since they drop it anywhere not buying."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Well, sad to say I haven't bought anything as of yet but most definitely will by end of the month! Browsing and navigation is a breeze. There is a very large variety to select from that caters to everybody's taste. As far as I can tell by reading the clients comments the sizing is mostly (±85%) true to size and if you are honest to yourself and follow the measurements guidelines given with every item and comments from other clients, you will be pleased with what you receive. Love this app alot!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Good experience some items have cheap clothes but that was like one crop top out of 20 I ordered. I wish they had different model builds on there so we can see what actually fits. A lot of the stuff is the same fabric reused over and over.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app! I've ordered a few things and they hopefully turned out good, the cloths are really nice , cute & chic. The orders deliver within a week with good packing, the only problem is with the Return Policy otherwise it is a wonderful app!❤️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Really glad I happened to come across this shopping app cause it's the ""only"" shopping app that actually has petite sizes on their jeans!! If you're 5'2 and shorter, they've got jeans for you!, as well as different types and sizes for you awesome women out there!! Go check it out, their apparel is pretty much true to size, too!!! The only draw back is the delivery, it takes about 2 weeks, and that's why it's a 4 star rating."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"As long as I use the size chart and check to see if the garment runs true to size, or small I get the correct size everytime. As far as the tools, well you get what you pay for. Don't expect a $5 tool to work like a $50 tool and you won't be disappointed. I love everything I have gotten from this app. Not that I haven't had a few things break on me but I don't expect something that cost me very little to be great."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"While the shipping is fast for me, the recent changes to the app that only allows me to shop in Asia makes me have to look for clothing in my fit and personal style a lot longer. I'd like to be able to add items from another region like the US which I like a lot more than what's available on the Shein Asia site. Also, why are the clothes in Asia all for teens? Women of other ages also exist and have more spending power so the lack of a selection will make us go somewhere else."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like most of the pieces I've bought. The only issue I have is some of the piece were not fitting as well as others. This might be my fault for not looking closely to the size description and go directly to medium. Overall, prices are good , delivery time is good and quality is as expected for the price. Would definitely shop there again !"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Been shopping with Shein for a few years now and I think it's a great site. Good quality clothing at a decent price and plenty of incentives to shop here. You earn points for your orders and more points to review your orders. These points can then be taken off your bill and there's always an extra discount code too. It's brilliant! I've become totally addicted!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Clothes are a hit or miss with fitting but are cute! Customer service is horrible tho I emailed last time it took over about a month or so for something to finish delivering to me and got no response. I also had a return delivered back to the location this past Friday that still hasn't been marked as received at warehouse so the customer service is why I gave only a 3 star review
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Never had a bad experience before, usually delivery on time except for peak holiday periods. Quality of the clothing is always good, I'm actually surprised. Just wish they had express shipping to South Africa 🇿🇦"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing.....great deals, something for everyone. Honestly would recommend for sure!! Good prices for the products at hand. Products don't look cheap at all. Have a few items from here already and they are great quality!! Get get get"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shien has such a great variety of things for all sizes! Their plus size range is absolutely stunning and allows bigger girls to wear beautiful things. The quality is incredible, I found you just need to read the reviews regarding sizing. Shein has been an absolute life saver and financial saver for my wedding with regards to bridesmaids outfits, mother of the bride and mother of the groom outfits, accessories and even decor! I am a big Shien fan and highly recommend it to all!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Shein has been a great shopping app to me. It's so amazing with good products and qualities. It's so worth buying and with no regret. There's great gaining in this app as it provides sales mostly and check in points. It helps us all alot including those who are not able to have the chance to do so. Great advantages in here and absolutely great app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the glitter dresses, the bodycon dresses, the car accessories, body jewelry, socks, lingerie sets, artificial nails, eyelashes, sweatsuits, pet toys, office supplies and organizing accessories, thank you cards, party favors, holiday decorations and gifts. Whew! I like a lot and buy a lot. The prices and discounts are worth it! Sometimes the quality, fit + longevity vary.. but I've never been disappointed"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"you NEED to try it. I've only ordered once from shein and I'm definitely not disappointed. The quality of the clothes and other products were really worth the money. I bought quite a lot of things like tops, sweatshirt and accesories and they're hands down AMAZING in my sight."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Aside from the reported stealing of designs, the customer service is awful. I've contacted them for several issues before but not once have they resolved my concerns. Also, the monthly promotion of first 199 orders is a hoax. Sale promotion is a hoax too, most of them are not really on sale but indicated as such, with the original price written off as the sale price. Not worth it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app. They have a beautiful variety of clothes for everybody's different taste in clothing. Great deals too with the coupons and points. Everything I've ordered I have received in perfect condition. I will continue do make purchases on this app. I'm glad I saw the Ads for this app lol. Totally recommend
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Hard to decide between 3 and 4 stars because I really love the clothes and size options on this app and how easy returns are. My only gripe is that I've kept several pieces from shein that have broken after the first use.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I haven't ordered anything as of yet. Got things in my cart. Nice prices on things. So far no problems at all with this app. I would recommend it. Finally ordered things and they were delivered yesterday as said. I loved all my items I ordered and in great condition. Will definitely be ordering from them again.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible customer service! I didn't receive my order and they cancelled it without asking me. The reason they cited is that I rejected the order. The truth is I never got any call from delivery person, I tried to reach out to customer care so many times and I kept waiting for my order for a month. Pathetic. I'm never going to order from shein again. You guys learn professionalism first before starting a business."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I think there was a recent update thats making the review images load in super low quality to the point where you can barely see the product properly, please fix this. Otherwise a great shopping app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I don't know, I like this app however sometimes orders take a while to arrive. One of the things I hate is that its similar to wish, for some of the items it says ""random color"", personally I hate that and I believe alot of people agree."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Worst shopping site. This is fraud. I cancelled my order and initiated a refund request but they are not giving my money back and whenever I tried to reach out to them they took my bank details by saying that it'll generate in 4-5 days but it's been 15 days and they're not giving my money back. Worst experience. Not gonna use this website again
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shien is an excellent online shopping app, but the cons of this app is that it is quite cheap material(dont get me wrong of course, their stuff is so cute) but the jewellery break very easily unlike other stores (like prettylittlething)but their jewelry is expensive but it is good material. It arrives on time or even earlier than expected and that is good. I definitely recommend this app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's fairly good with cute clothes and nice organization, but my only criticism is that the app is really choppy when trying to scroll down through them. It's not like my phone speed or internet speed is an issue, because I dont have the same problem with any other apps. Overall I enjoy looking through the clothes but the choppiness makes it somewhat hard to enjoy as much."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"OMG I'm kinda obsessed with SHEIN app , great to navigate & always good suggestions tailored for u . Earn points by doing fashion board competitions & just by signing in everyday. Also a chance to be in with some freebies .. just review the items you're sent & keep them . It's all about the reviews 💯🙌🏻✨️keep up the good work @SHEIN"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Good quality and prices The delivery us faster than specified, items are amazing, a lot of people say some items come smaller than expected but they don't check the sizes, the sizes are specified in the description, is not their fault. I spent over £500 on shein so far, I first started shopping beginning of the year. That's my favourite shop. I bought kids clothes, clothes for myself, candle moulds, home decorations, kitchen stuff, bathroom stuff. Literally everything! I definitely recommend it!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My order(placed on Apr 24th) was shipped on 12th May and there's no update yet even though I live in a green zone. I have received orders from different site. But on SheIn there has been no update on the tracking either. I tried connecting to customer support but it was of no use. Tried to contact via email and still no response. Having no other choice, I'm leaving my complaint here. Terrible."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I haven't seen any shopping app best before shein . I have many purchases from shein and i am always Very happy by its price, quality, delivery services all. I am assured that the products of shein are always higher than my expectations. I never thought of reviewing any app in such a broad paragraph but i am showing my love and loyalty towards this app. The products of shein are affordable and has many varieties in every type of product."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I've been using SHEIN for 3 years and love it, and never had an issue until now. When I try to return an item, a page pops up saying ""400 Bad Request; Request Header or Cookie Too Large."" That also happens when I click on Support. So now, it seems as if they're trying to prevent me from returning anything, and if so, that means I'm completely done shopping on SHEIN."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app.. Products were amazing.. Good material.. Delivered within time.. Highly recommend app. But there's a problem in packaging of few products..leather material products should be properly packed.. Overall products are good. Over 10000+ products are available in shein..amazing collection of jewelery, shoes, stationary items, hair accessories, decorative items, plus size clothes, etc. Products are worth buying.. U can get discount. By applying various vouchers.. Hope u all enjoy shopping👖."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I found shein through a British family on youtube(the Inghams) I also started seeing other influensters sharing. Upon my first few orders i had hits and misses as I learned to read closer the reviews of items and descriptions. I was hooked. I am totally in love with Shein. I order as often as budget permits and have found my wardrobe now being predominantly Shein. Clothing is great quality and prices are incredible. Coupons are readily available and lots of ways save. Love Shein!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Everything is so inexpensive and I was skeptical at first but their stuff is actually pretty well made. You just have to check the reviews and photos. You also get discounts for leaving reviews good or bad. Pleasantly surprised with this shopping app. I recommend this to the fullest.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app, I've never had any issues with the site crashing. I also love being able to filter specifically for my size, that saves so much time. I ❤ everything I've purchased!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The clothes are good, look at the reviews before you buy it. I ordered something around one month ago and it still is not here. I understand some hold back because of the pandemic, just the shipping is super long its quite annoying."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Are you kidding? I love shein. You just can't beat Shein. Romwe is great too but they each have their own advantages. The staff of shein have been very cooperative with any questions or concerns I've had. Waiting on another order now. Also, I really appreciate that Shein gives people the opportunity to express themselves in such a diversity of size ranges and styles. It makes me feel excited to shop for plus size clothing for myself, and I get to see everyone else trying it on too."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,App shopping is easy and items I order to items received ratio 10/10 with zero mistake two separate orders and both arrived 2 days earlier than predicted.

Couldn't be more piss off"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein has been the only online store for plus size options that is actually true to size for me. Although like any other clothing brands and depending on the material, it is very comfy and durable. A lot of high rise which I prefer and I can move comfortablely without having to pick up my pants or lower my shirt. The clothes literally feel like they sit on top of me and give me a flattering look. I love how many options Shein provide for all styles. 💚"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Everything I ever looked for in an app.. However,try to be accurate on the shipping dates you indicate upon placing an order since the courier company might call when someone isn't arround hence missing out on early delivery .. Other than that,great app😍😍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is great, so many good quality things to buy going from clothes, house decor and cool gadgets and the fact that you can save points from giving reviews and buy things for free or discounted is awsome. I really couldn't complain."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing I have used it for the past 3+ years, but the past two swimming suits I've ordered on two different occasions something always happens, my first one I ordered the top didn't ship so I sent it back and got a refund, this time as recently as yesterday I got a swimming suit and it WAS NOT the one I ordered. I love how cute the suits are on shein and my VERY FIRST swimming suit I have ever gotten on here is my favorite one ever and I wanted more but something seems to go wrong."

I also like how they give you coupons and you can earn points by checking in every day, with every purchase you make, and also by the reveiws you write on items. Definitely recommend if your looking for affordable cute and trendy clothes!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I never buy clothes online due to weather I will receive what I've ordered or due to sizing. I thought will give this site a try as I like the look of the clothes being advertised and they aren't stupidly overpriced and actually affordable. I love how they also has a kid section which I will definitely will be using in the future. The app has been easy to navigate, customer service were also very helpful, they were quick with replies. I have only ordered today so I'm unsure what shipping is like"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love this app. I can find so many affordable items that aren't just clothing related. I love that it has something for me, the kids, and the men in my life. Everything I've bought has looked exactly like the picture and was true to size.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I wanted to bring to your attention an unfortunate incident regarding a recent purchase I made. On [07/1/2023], I paid $170 for a package from Shein Canada, but unfortunately, the package was never delivered. I tried reaching out to Shein Canada multiple times to inquire about the status of my order, but unfortunately, I haven't received any response from them. Frustrated with the situation, I decided to escalate the matter to PayPal for assistance."

I placed an order on 1st June from their site and there are certain items that don't suit me well and while placing their return, it is showing failure and I have already tried quite a few times. It's been days since I am trying to return that item"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Shein's size guide chart is inaccurate and misleading. They will not issue a refund even though they neglected to provide accurate information in regards to sizing. Also, I wrote a product review on each item I ordered and they neglected to approve it to the reviews in each item listing I am assuming because the reviews I gave were 3 stars or less. They do no offer quality products or adequate customer service. I wouldn't recomend."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is a great app to get cheap items with good quality. I have been using shein for 3 years now and it is a very great place to shop. I usually get my packages earlier than it is supposed to arrive which is a good thing to me! One thing that is annoying is that using coupons may not give you the result your looking for. But other than that, it's a nice app and I'm very grateful for it!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have been shopping with Shein for several years now way before it became as popular as it is now and it has only gotten better over the years! The customer service and quality of products are exceptional. To date, I have never had a bad shopping experience. Thank you Shein for always having great merchandise and awesome prices!!! I am a customer for life!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Shopping from the app is relatively easy. The interface is also visually appealing and I honestly prefer it to the website. I love shopping from shein so using the app just makes everything easier for me.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was having an issue while entering to my account on my laptop when adding the region to United States but I have fixed the problem in the app. I have seen incredible offers and coupons and I expect more so I can, purchase more stuff from us."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app! Its amazing I've bought so much in there. The shipping only takes about 4 days. I am 12 years old and I buy shirts from X-Small. I wish there were more clothes for 13-14 year olds. I'd love if you could add more to the kids section. Also I'd love if you could add more sport bras into the girl section. Amazing app! I think I might become addicted..
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein. It gives you points for checking in to the site that you can use towards purchases which is a cool bonus. There are lots of affordable clothing options, accessories, & lots of other cool stuff on the app. I highly recommend."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have ordered SheIn multiple times for many, many different items! Bathing suits, sweaters, shirts, pants, I could go on for a while. They have improved their quality, just check reviews before buying. Shipping is fast and they work with afterpay, which is a wonderful benefit!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this appt. The variety of clothes and the price, The only downside is the customer service. I have had things break after only a few months, and over the 45-day limit of return, but when I've contacted them to complain, they say there is nothing they can do! So some things are a total waste of money, and you are left with faulty goods."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very quick delivery time. One thing I've noticed though is the sizing of items. I have just received 2 sweatshirts both sized 16 but one is about 4 inches longer than the other ! Apart from that I bought several outfits fir my granddaughter and they are fine 🙂
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Some things can be really great about this store such as, price, time frame to received goods and some quality of the products I have purchased. Some of my items have been very cheap and rough quality, I have the sizing understanding but I feel that it needs to be clear sizing not 74 or 160."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Package was STOLEN! I've never had a problem with Shein until recently. I made an order & it said it would deliver between 03/21/23-03/23/23. I was out of town during the weekend & my package arrived on Saturday, which was the 18th of March. I did not get an email notification that it had been delivered. It was also noted in the app that it was delivered & someone ""signed"" for it when no one was home. Smh. Shein needs to do better with their deliveries."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My sister has been using SHEIN for over a year and has gotten me many things over the course of said year and I love every single piece given to me. I just made my very first purchase using After Pay and I rather like that ability and is another app my sister got me into which is really helpful with bi-weekly payments for your SHEIN (or many other apps and sites) orders it makes it even more affordable than ever to shop SHEIN. (Oi that sounds scripted, ADHD things and thoughts)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,What the fk your customer support robot is useless. I can't get it to help me and it won't let me talk to an agent or send a ticket. Hello I have an issue with my whole order and it's useless. The app is great but sometimes items are bad quality and come damaged or different and I can't get yall to help me ??? Pls contact me so I can get in touch with someone about it
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was super skeptical of this app at first. I figured it was basically another version of WISH which had disappointed me more than one time. However the last few purchases I made were completely satisfactory! I even bought majority of my decorations for my wedding from here!!! It came out AMAZING. Now with clothes obviously sometimes the quality is not exactly name brand and is sometimes see-through, but you get what you look and pay for 99% of the time."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Worst customer service support! I've been trying to contact them but no response in the support chatbox. I've got missing order and im not sure whether i still can get it or not coz their service s*cks! My first and last time ordering! I should have listened to what others say about Shein. Disappointed.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Am i reviewing the app or my experience with the overall shopping in the app. Well for the app it gets a 5 star but for my overall shopping experience gets 0 stars if i could give 0 i would due to my order being a lost consignment it mysteriously come up missing i never received my 70.00 order thanks shein for your messed up delivery service. Maybe you should open up some stores so people can go in and try on and dont have to deal with shipping and not receiving or shipping and having to return
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The return policy is horrible. You have to take pictures with the clothes on to show why you are returning them on top of paying a fee after the first return. It is embarrassing to have to put something on that you don't feel comfortable in and take a picture... what if it's something lingerie. I think they do it because most people don't want to do something like that. Then the fee. Really how would it be my fault if it doesn't fit right or doesn't look right on me.?
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is great for buying clothes at an affordable price, problem is their shipping method. They have changed their delivery service from Aramex which was good for us, to Buffalo which is ridiculously expensive. It's tax and vat are way more than we can afford, not happy with them"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've always received the correct items, and I've ordered 3 times now, probably 30-40 items. Everything is not the best quality / thickest fabric but totally worth the price to have lots of cute outfits! I don't like to wear the same outfit many times anyway...I love the sizing so I know if it'll fit, and everything is very true to size 😍 With the 25% off coupon every time I still try to qualify for free expidited shipping, which last time took around 7 days to get to Vancouver Island in Canada."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Is alright but some expensive pricings on a lot of mediocre items that you can also get at a local Dollarama, alot of the clothing items are a bit questionable in styles, cheaply made, unevenly seamed, body type specific and easily torn. Really gotta watch the review ratings on everything."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Always love shopping from shein! The sizes are pretty accurate and the clothes are good quality for such a good price. And the app is so easy to use. They have so many little cute gifts and accessories too, not just clothes."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I ordered a product which was bigger than my size even it was XS. I know they didn't give the shipping back. I write a review indicating about larger size and shipping process. SHEIN DENIED MY REVIEW because it wasn't positive. This is such a cheap trick to improve sales: by not showing honest negative reviews. I'm so disappointed. That is why all the products have 99% positive reviews. They DENY the negative ones. Check it by your own. Every product has positive reviews only.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I will not order anymore. If u order only 25 € u don't know when if will arrive. There is no option for tracking Sometimes arrives earlier or later but u never know the day. So if u're working u dont know when u have to stay at home to wait for the package. If u order more than 39 € there is available the tracking but its never updated. Some products are good and on website it's easier to find more similar product than on app, but I will not order because the shipping it's not well organized."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,no doubt clothes on shein are trendy and sometimes cheap too but their customer service is really really awful. if the item does not fit and one asks for return they cancel your return and if you contact customer care executive you can be on waiting line for more than an hour.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Some good quality it's but also some bad quality . Not all sizes true to size . One style fits the next style doesn't. Can't understand why you can't return sale or marked down items and this should be made more clear before purchase and for this reason I don't think I would order again
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Overall my experience has been 5 star all the way, sizing is great for me, but my daughter it vary in sizing, but no problems with returns when to big or small in size. Value for money, and easy to use the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good clothes, rapidly sent. New clothes lists are all small sizes, even though they have a great curves and plus section. Selection of gifts, cards, jewelry, and random things is almost as large as their list of clothing (which first drew me to Shein). Inexpensive, not cheap."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love this site. I only gave it a 4 star rating because sometimes the sizes are not true to size. some comments feel almost placed. because I wear a maurice's plus 1-2 now and I ordered a 4x in case ifs like wish, it fit well, unfortunately the material was very cheap, my books kept falling out and I am 6ft 1 inch tall about 260 I'm a big and tall girl and the top fit so short. some items were worth it. I love the variety though. wish for more tall plus clothing"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I am totally in love with SHEIN!! I've already bought tons of stuff and I highly recommend this App. I read the review on all items before I buy. The pictures other customers post are extremely helpful also because some items don't look as good as they do on the app. This is also a great place to shop for my grandkids. They love it too.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have sent the return receipt so many times & yet I have not received my refund wallet. It is already May 8 & I have sent my returned items in pristine condition last March 30. It's more than one month, why is it so difficult & takes a very long time to process refund in SheIn. I am posting here since their customer service have also failed to help me."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So far, clothes and shoes I ordered were great. I also like it that all items are delivered together. I suggest you give freebies to your loyal customers especially when they bought a lot of items. Thank you! Keep up the good work shein!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've order from the site in May, still haven't recieved my package. There's no call center or customer service to speak to, just an automatic computer responding. Tracking info hasn't been updated since May. Basically no one to tell you anything. It's ridiculous. It will almost be 3 months."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Worst online experience ever. I have 2 orders and one has been two months the other an month and a half and still nothing. The tracking sucks and so does the customer service. They wont cancel the items or refund them. And all it says is tracking number created.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Okay, I am officially addicted to Shein. I find so many fun things here. I shop at least twice a month on here. I keep seeing things I have to have. Everything is pretty true to size as far as clothing goes, which allows you to buy with confidence. Accessories are my fave though, and Shein has a huge selection! The prices are good, so go ahead and spice up your fits with amazing accessories. I am a very happy customer!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing i have been ordering for years and have liked everything that i have bought i even got a long evening gown for a film premiere from here its gorgeous i always get loads if complements on my clothes and even got 3 of my friends shopping from there, delivery time does take a while but definitely worth it!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Honestly it's maybe one of the best shopping stores but I cant shop. I go to checkout and it gives me an oops problem with the servers, I go to Customer Service and it's just a white screen,FAQ, also a white screen. Uninstalled then reinstalled it's the same so I don't know what's up. Very sad about this"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I actually get a lot of my clothes off of this website and they are by far the ones that get the most compliments. They look exactly like the photos but sometimes it is a little hard trying to guess your size, but they give off measurements for you to look at. I will definitely be using this app more often and recommending my friends to it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I LOVE Shein & I LOVE this app! It is super easy to use & I love everything about Shein! I feel like I have a direct line to the manufacturer at the BEST prices! Shopping Shein is like having the inside scoop on the newest fashions at the best prices & they have EVERYTHING for your entire life! Home goods, gadgets, pet supplies...Shein is #1 for fashion, but it is also so much more! This app has it ALL!! 10/2022 The app has gotten even better! Now there are 2'malls' so your size is rarely OOS!😍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,the app itself is good.. never had any issues with automatic logging out like I do with footlocker .. and the business is good. so are the products for the most part ... except some of the customer service agents could use some communication and service training.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The filter options are reduced :( it was the best thing about shein that you had a lot of options so searching what you look for was so easy! Like for exemple i don't see the length of sleeves filter option.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Fitting can sometimes be weird. They have no expected delivery date so they take their own sweet time with delivery. Extremely unprofessional. The online support is a chat bot which is totally useless. It is so difficult to get in touch with them. No one answers the call when you try to get in touch with the Shein team.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the range of clothes, colours and that you can see other angles of the clothes (back, side etc). They have a bit of everything too!! From shoes, clothes to homeware to skincare and haircare!! It's so great I defo recommend."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I sent back some clothing for credit to buy other merchandise on your site. I was told it was to late for a return, but the clothes have not been returned to me. The amount is close to $60 and I can not get a hold of any true customer support access. I buy alot of clothes are your site and this is really upsetting. I want credit or for the clothes to returned to me."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I love the swimsuits and the variety of clothes for semi plus size. I just found out they use extreme amounts of lead on the material and I'm not going to shop here anymore! This is very very disappointing! They don't deserve any stars for lead is a danger to our bodies!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Amazing pricing! Amazing Clothes! Amazing home decor! Amazing everything !! ACCEPT for closed toed shoe varitey, And shipping cost is crazy. Almost $4 for $1 ring???? Yall got to kidding!!! Please find some wiggle room to lower shipping cost. Ohh and not all of us feel comfortable in crop tops and i feel like thats 75% of your tops/tshirt inventory. 😔😞😭 I know thats whats in right now but can we please get more regular length or atleast SPECIFY when it cropped in all your cropped shirts?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great for shopping cheap. Mostly ships from outside of the US so shipping is a little longer. Ive ordered from them around 5 times now and had 0 issues. Will continue to shop with SheIn. I wish the app had a better filtering or recommending option.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Sometimes shopping here is a ""hit and miss"" scenario. If for any reason you want to return something than you are better off just giving to a griend or donate to Goodwill. Shein pays for Shipping back something the first time you return anything. Which costs around $7.00 USD. Any returns after that are ALL ON YOU. If you bargain shop (like me) and an item you buy is below $7.00 than it is not worth returning because you DO NOT get REFUNDED for ANY SHIPPING FEES. Hope this helps!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, This app has great prices, You can get lots of good things for great deals, It does take up to about 2 weeks for shipping, But it's worth it for a lot of stuff, Example if you get like a paint pallet that has like a bucket with like 2 sides a pallet and a lid and a handle dial costs like 15 to $20 on Amazon and Shein You can get it for like 5 to $10 so it's a very good deal."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing company for people with little to no money. good quality clothing and items. Some items are a little sketchy and obviously cheap. But yall have good shirts and and skirts. I love ur jewlery. Most look as if they cost like $20 when there only about 2-5 dollars. Totally worth the money. If ur body runs larger like mine some clothing items may be a bit tight and difficult but honestly i make it work. Im glad they have plus sizes too, good company thx!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The prices are outrageous. The cheap things are listed first (maybe 4 or 5 items). Then after that the prices jump up over 60%. I ordered 3 sweater coats and they never sent them. They never returned my calls or my text. ""BEWARE"""
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have ordered several items from Shein and am overall pleased. My only issues are the sizing of most clothing. For myself (plus size) I go by the measurements and have been well fitted (mostly); but men's and kids clothing has no consistency at all. I love the women's plus size clothing. It's not ugly old circus tents and tarps...it's nicely designed fashionable clothing for ALL ages. I am 58 and find very nice age appropriate but not boring things all the time.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Products are good in this app. But the main problem is in tracking the product. Customer care response. They never knew when the product will be delivered and if anything go wrong while delivering they say to wait but they don't take any initiation to sort the issue and inform customers . I waited for more than one month for a package still no proper response. Please improve all and provide valid number to contact customer care. If a package is delayed please arrange acknowledgement.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"There are so so many cute options on Shein. I just ordered sunglasses, some pants, a skirt, a shirt, a bodysuit, a dress and some eyeshadow for just over $50!! The prices are incredible and they have amazing selections for plus size as well!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Extraordinary! I love how theres always coupons for every order and prices and theres free shipping as well for orders over $20. Its amazing how theres always coupons daily for you to use and it gives you enough and good deals as well. This is a total go to when you shop for attires. Even when you have little budgets theres also installments given as well. Its easy and fadt to creat an account too. Theres even products that offers quick ship. They ship fast as well without them as well.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is great, lots of stylish western wear. I always prefer Shein for Western wear.. but I think they should include Indian ethnic wears also that would be great. I'm just disappointed but the delivery service and return policies. And they should mention an estimated date of delivery compulsorily. That's the missing point in Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Well built app- easy to browse & buy but terrible customer service. They make it impossible to chat/talk to a human when your have issues with your order. Watch out for ""FREE"" shipping fee as they still charge you when you check out despite the order value surpassing the minimum amount required to have free shipping. I have been caught out several times and its impossible to get a refund."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was skeptical but I was pleasantly surprised. I order all the way in Namibia Africa and the service is excellent and packages always arrive before I expect them. Advice is always measure yourself, get a tape measure so you always get the right size. Works for me. Thanks Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the styles and colors of your designs. And the price... oh my goodness the price! The prices are so that any woman no matter their financial strain, can afford to buy a few staple pieces and build off those. No one should have to use the excuse, ""I don't have anything to wear. "" With Shein the choices are endless. It doesn't matter what size your body is either. Shein has something cute and reasonably priced to fit ALL sizes."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app to shop!! I absolutely love it!! Fast delivery, great prices, great quality of items...I have YET to be disappointed with the items I have purchased! And I have purchased A LOT! If you like to shop, like me, it's a no brainer, it's a must have app!! Happy shopping! Thank you Shein!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Loving shein so far! Everything works great, an order of rings and lipstick should get to my house by tonight or tomorrow and im very excited. I have one issue with the app and that is ring sizes. When I first got the app I could go to rings and click ring guide and choose between centimeters and inches, now I click size guide on any rings and the sizes don't appear at all. I'm disappointed because I want to order rings that fit, and the app doesn't need an update, so please fix this <3"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I don't typically leave reviews but it asked me so I figured why not? I love shein, I'm sure 99% of people do! They have something for everyone at very affordable prices. Shipping may take longer than Amazon but when you're spending a fraction of the price it's definitely worth it!! Everything I've purchased so far has been of excellent quality, just make sure to read reviews! We all rely on reviews when it comes to purchasing online & definitely appreciate seeing all photo reviews!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Find sizing a bit of a problem. I ordered a watch in my second order and never received it struggled to get hold of you and gave up. Order another watch in my third order and got it. Colors are not always the same as the picture. Most of the things we have ordered are great. Especially the men's clothing no complaints.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Payment facility is unstable. Payment was made but an error was returned. Then after a minute, the app gave a successful message. Had I not waited for a minute, it would've been a double charge."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is my first time ordering from Shein. My daughter lives in Shein's because almost every other day she get 2 to 3 large packages or boxes full of makeup, clothes, shoes and nail supplies. Half of my grandson room is stuffed with Sheins items and bags. Now I'm hooked on it. Their quality of clothes and of items are fantastic. You can easily break your break your bank account so be very careful...lol they have nice selection and the shipping time is pretty good as well."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Pretty good It has fast shipping but some of their stuff is cheap material and can look more attracting in the picture.But not all of their stuff is that way most of the stuff I order was good material and good quality just make sure you read about the product you want and the reviews.bbut overall the app is so good!!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Better quality than you expect. I would compare it to any other fast fashion brand - lots of polyester crepe clothes, but certainly very wearable. Pay attention to the reviews and make sure you actually take your own measurements before choosing a size. Good prices and FREE RETURN SHIPPING - you can afford to buy 10 items and return 4. No scamming you on the return, and the refund is very quick. I've honestly bought 3 times now and I will order again."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is absolutely amazing! It exceeded my expectations. I oredered for the 1st time last week..my order was scheduled to be delivered on Dec. 13 and it came yesterday Nov. 30!

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"What's not to love. Well fitting clothes, good jewelry, excellent prices. So far so good with the app. My only problem is the app does not open from my email, even after changing the settings multiple times."

You will not regret ordering your whole wardrobe from this store the only suggestion read the reviews on the products you like everything I've gotten is amazingly beautiful! The only problem I have is when I'm shopping getting the pictures to load sometimes it takes me a few days to order but it's so worth it! I do and I will recommend this site to all of my friends and family. Just please please please text the pictures! Even though I still love this store
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Do not buy jeans from here, the sizes are terrible and the buttons are more like cheaply sewn in plastic that breaks super easy, with that said the tops are cute make sure your read what they're made of because they sell WAY too much polyester tops. They look cute but in person, hideous. Read descriptions! It's an ok app with ok clothes of you're careful."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Ordered a top & bottom outfit and a romper. I'm in love with them! They fit perfectly. Shipped fast. Great quality, great prices!!

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I was turned on to this app by a friend. I told her there was NO way the clothes would be made w any quality for the prices I saw listed. She assured me I would be wrong. I will fully admit how wrong I was. I love this site! Exchanges and returns are quick and easy. Sizes are true and the quality has been very good.

So far only 2 items came in bigger sizes, a boyfriend jean,I ordered another one that is one size down and was perfect and the top (I think it was plus size cut because even 2 sizes down tops I bought still became too big but fitted my plus size friends perfectly and they bought them. Overall I will say your products are 👌🏾🤟🏾 #❤️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Super, fashionable, affordable, amazing, I love everything about SHEIN Fashion. Every time I bought things that would make me feel more comfortable and loveable . I start buying things from Shein a year ago and I will not stop buying things. If I ordered things always ❤❤❤ I recommend shein they have so many different options and loveable things"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The deals are unbeatable so far... Now the real question is will they remain as frequent?? I've not yet had the chance to check the quality of the items for myself yet but I don't have too many concerns about this factor in reality just bc I've heard a lot of ppl say shop here & basically scoff at the idea of shopping anywhere else. I'm an eBay fan at 💜 so if I find a store to rival all the shops tht eBay offers me, than I'm definitely sold for good but I'm not sure that's going to happen!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's legit! I ordered a whole new wardrobe and it's so affordable. All the items are good quality and have lasted and washed well! And they're great at processing returns too for those items that don't fit. 10/10! Will use again!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,My first time ordering there i got about 23 things and it was divided into 2. 20 of the items came at once and the other 3 were supposed to come. Was marked as delivered on shein and on the usps tracking website too but i never got it. I dont know what happened but that was soo disappointing. I dont think i woupd ever teust ordering things in larger quantity from this store any more.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I LOVE SHEIN SO MUCH it has some really good stuff for cheap prices but their has been some complaints about bugs founds in items but when I get things it's never happened I'm just being honest plus u have to pay 6 dollars just for the shipping fee... Hopefully that helps a little
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Out of about 50 items I purchased from Shein thus far I've really liked about 10 items. I purchased one pair of tights that I found to be soft and thick enough. The other clothing purchases I found to be mostly poor quality material and/or very thin/see through. The majority of items I noticed are what another user described and I would agree as 'trashy' - and on the cusp of soft porn. I would not call this a family clothing store as they have branded on one of their shipping labels I noticed.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's more than 40 days I have returned an Item due to fit issues and still haven't got any refund for that ! Whenever I call customer care they keep on delaying rather than helping to sort my issue I don't know why they are doing this with their customers, product is with them, I have returned the Item and still no refund even after waiting for 40 days !"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love this app I can get bags on bags of items without feeling like I shouldn't have spent that much money. I get stuff for my cats and clothes jewelry and it makes me smile when I get to open a bunch of packages of really cute affordable stuff. People always say omg that's so cute where you get it and when you say shein they look like they can't believe it but girl get in you're bag!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Shein used to be a lot better; but the changes in games and ways to earn points/coupons SUCK now. They took away daily gifts, points seem to expire a lot quicker, and the games have been changed to make it IMPOSSIBLE to win coupons, points, or credits. You have to share the game/app to get anything. They need to stop trying to be Temu and go back to how it was. Its ridiculous that they act as if you can get things, but you have to stop right away if you don't share it. Super disappointing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I love shein, 98% of the time their clothes come flawless. It must be a new update but now the points you earn every day expire? I'm super pissed because it takes forever to get alot and I spent a few months checking in everyday just to have 347 points and I just noticed it said 117 will be expiring in 7 days! I know it not alot but it took forever to get that many!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app works well, no hiccups, fast, easy to use. As for the site, wow! I can't believe the prices for the quality of the shirts I bought. I'm getting some pj's now for summer. Edit: things on the site sell out FAST, so when you find something you want, DON'T WAIT!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Fantastic, I used to use WISH all the time but if something goes wrong with a purchase, the don't care to fix the problem. It happened to me numerous times! Then I found SHEIN, their products get to me fast & it's one low postage price, I love them! Fabulous job SHEIN, I rate you 12/10 lol."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely amazing, I'm astonished! Just in case you think this is a bot account it's not I'll even say something a bot wouldn't say, JSchlatt did it and you know it, anyways this app is amazing and you do get everything so sexy and cute for such a low price and even coupons too! I really recommend this app, but do know that if you don't know your size and most things, then the things you get might be too big or too small for you so remember to check your size!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's good, love the design, love how fast the transaction, but in contacting the costumer service - there's a bit of a gap in there,...what I meant is - have placed an order, few minutes after, have realized I have ordered wrong size, So have searched how to contact costumer service and it took me more than 10 min to figure it out how to reach them , to cut the long story short,... Costumer service can respond within 24 hrs and in short, my ordered have been shipped already,"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is a good place to buy clothes online but app is updated very late for tracking orders in germany. I cant fins a way to change language of the app and no select button to take things off my ""recently viewed"" and ""my saves"""
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Update: EXCESSIVE NOTIFICATION!! I uninstalled the app and now reinstalled the app to give them another go. In 24 hours I've 6 or 7 notifications! This app is so intrusive it's not funny. You are basically installing Spam Ware. Old Review:Extremely hard to get a refund if something arrives broken!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great everything arrives on time. I have been a shein customer for 2 years now and I have only been dissatisfied 2xs out of over 50. So I'd say it's a yes. Anything is never a waste because prices are perfect! I will continue being a shein customer and recommend this app to anyone who wants to order anything. All orders you must atleast give it one week for your delivery arrival. Thank you shein! Yours truly A Happy Customer 😊 😃. Nicole W
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've used this app for a while and it has been excellent. They have a multitude of options to choose from, whether it be clothes, bathroom decor, kitchen decor, room decor, lights, accessoires, electronics, ect, you will always find something new to look at."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great service and very impressed with the quality for the price it's very good will continue to order from yourselves then only downside and its not really to bad if you plan ahead but items could be delivered quicker but if you do plan ahead if you need for a special occasion just order with enough time x
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was skeptical when i placed my first order because ive been so disappointed with other online purchases. When i received my first order i was impressed with how quick it came, then when i opened my order every item was in its own bag....and even the bags are nice quality...and the products i ordered were actually what i ordered, not some cheap hideous ill fitting junk. Im so pleased with every item. Im hooked on shein!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Sheins customer service department is absolutely amazing! They went above and beyond to resolve any issue I had. They were very prompt and courteous. I would recommend shein to anyone! They have beautiful things that are high quality at a low price. TOTALLY LOVING SHEIN!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I always shop on shein for everything. Cloths to house holds. It my to go first to look for the items I need. The products come as they are shown in the photos. The reviews on the items are helpful and prices on there are great.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is easy to navigate, prices on items are crazy cheap, and the sizes when using the measurement table is a true fit. I love this app because it has everything my family and I need. Way to go SHEIN, finally something that I love."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So easy to use and the quality is really good. The majority of what I've bought has been true to size (I'm a UK size 8). You do need to ensure that you check each size as some clothing is in UK sizes and others state S M or L but in some items L is a UK size 8 so just bear this in mind. Getting a refund is a simple business. Just make sure you replace the items in the correct bag it came in (the bar codes will be on your order), print off a lable and post via the Post Office."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Well I am new to this app, but so far am very happy with a couple of purchases. It was easy to decide on the size parameters by reading the reviews to make decisions. It would be great if the description of the product is little bit more in detail. Overall easy to use and navigate the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Before the existence of Shein I had the desire to order the latest fashionthat will suite me. Since I have discovered When I realise what value it adds to my life. It is not about the products itself, it's more about the experience using Shown application that opened a new world to me. This application made it possible so search for a items that will fit me and not for 21 year old. The variety of colours for the available for the same item put forward a new dimension in choices something to wear"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,💢💢💢This might be super petty (I love the app and clothes) but I'M PISSED that the app refreshed for no reason after I spent a good hour reviewing and posing and taking pics of my first haul. ❗️❗️❗️ Please let me review items one by one instead of showing them all together. ❗️❗️❗️I had done half of them and then suddenly they were all blank. SALTY
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Just love love this online store. It makes me crazy, I just want to buy. And compare the R/$ rate it is not bad. Not bad at all. And we don't have that many varieties like shoes, dresses, cell phone items etc here in South Africa. Yes we have but Shein have so much more to choose from.."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Lots of choice for plus sizes, sizes and lengths do vary so best advice is to read the reviews for each item. Some times finish is hit and miss but overall its well worth the prices."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I'm giving low rating to this app, because I have ordered so many times from this app, everything was ok and I was also get good product from shein, but right now when I'm placing the order there is some shipping problem is going on, showing that it will not ship in my area... If I was calling to the customer care they are not responding my call so right now how my problem is going to be solve?? I need a reply, Shein. I want to buy something from there, so plz solve my shipping problem."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It has cute clothes but as soon as you put in xxl the options dwindle to the more unattractive clothes that cover everything, I prefer to dress in the cute clothes skinny girls get. It would be cool if your sizing went up to at least xxl for all your items, with your sizing chart that's not even that big. The price is good too."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,They have always been helpful and there products are amazing. I had a package go missing and I contacted support and they were nice and straight to the solutions. And sure enough a week later my reshape arrived in perfect condition Highly recommend
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am new to this whole online ordering of products and was a bit skeptical about the sizes and quality, but I have received my first order, the quality of the clothes are very good and it is the size measurements given on the item. I am impressed about how fast I received my order it was not even a month from when I placed my order. I will recomend this app for buying online any time. The tracking was also updated regularly. I will definitely be ordering from them again."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Excellent Everytime! Beautiful clothing for the whole family. Plus they are a one stop shop. I've never bought anything I didn't like. Clothes are just like the pictures. Easy and fast shipping always a sale. Easy fast simple returns too! Love SheIn!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app, has been really helpful when purchasing bits for our wedding. The only negative I would say is when you order an item and then it is discounted and you cannot return it. Otherwise love the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love Shein, it's like Christmas when we receive our orders. I love all my clothes iv ordered, my ladies tops and pajamas are the best. I'm very happy with the quality of the materials and the sizing. I will now order my my grand children and keep ordering for ever. My friends were all ordering and kept saying i must try, now that i have, i will keep ordering. I love Shein, the app is so easy to use, anyone can use it. Best ever App, got everything from clothes, makeups, bags. Best."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this app. Super cheap and affordable clothing, great coupons, and I've never had an issue with any products. I've bought swimwear, dog clothing, jewelry, clothes, and never had an issue!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My very 1st 5* rating ever!Never had to call costumer service f/anything.Everything is very streamlined from ordering,delivery,2returns.I buy fairly large orders and the delivery timing is ALWAYS on point or better.And regardless if I keep all 30 items or end up returning29,refunds never fail.Amazing prices,styles,entire place rocks!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love it!!! My new down time addiction is adding things to my wishlist Have made several purchases, love that I can use afterpay.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I have been ordering from shein from a long time but this time my prepaid orders been in my delivery area since a week and still not delivered. I have been talking at Customer care since then and still no positive outcomes. So unhappy with the services lately also got refund problems for another product too. So frustrating.!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the clothes. Havent had any problems with Shein but have been having problems with the courier service they chose to work with. Their clothes are great quality and they have such an amazing variety for amazing prices. Would definitely purchase a lot more from them. I just wish they couldve chosen Courier Guy to work with because Buffalo Logistics South Africa is very difficult and stressful to work with (Their ratings say as much). Furthermore, Shein is absoulutly amazing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein should disclose all the models are wearing slips. Almost everything is see-thru. You'll be thouroghly disappointed unless you know this information. It is about the cheapest quality material mixed with medium level sewing skills. Prices are way too high for such quality. Everything is cute but not practical. Also, I gave it 5 stars only bc I want more ppl to see this review. It actually deserves about 1 star."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Everything is so cheap! And really good quality for the price! I'm plus sized and everything fits at exactly how I wanted. Arrives in a timely manner and has tons and tons of stuff to offer. I get compliments on this stuff constantly and always recommend it
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app(store) The flash sales is the best part, but it doesn't stop there being in the Shein Club styling outfits for extra points it the best. Shein I must say exceeded my expectations! So if you haven't fill up a cart and join the team!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've had nothing but a great experience with Shein. The clothes are cute and cheap! You get what you pay for though. Some of it is a steal and some of it...gets returned. Returns are easy and processed as fast as can be expected. Thanks Shein!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I know it's fast fashion and that fast fashion is bad, but Shein is also the only place that caters to my unique sense of style and does it with options for my height. The shipping is great the clothes are good quality all worn and washed many times with no issues, I kinda have to give it a five star rating and happily recommend it to anyone."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Shein allows for plus size people the chance to have clothes that fit and are comfortable and affordable. They give you the chance to feel fashionable. Yes some of the fabrics are man made and some of the styles are way out but you can find something on their website to buy. It is pleasing to see plus size models used now to see how the clothes will look on the body.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have yet to buy anything. The items look to be really good quality, there are so many options for males,females, kids,home, and of course pets. Love to check the app daily, I have a lot of fun on here, and enjoy spending spare time watching the live videos, and taking part in the contests"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm so selfish with this app ❤. I'll add my review to help if you're considering to shop on SHEIN. Shein has good deals all year long. There might be other sites that might be cheaper but I won't even explore. Shein has got what I want. I can order for the entire family especially for my pet. As you can see I can go on and on. But, I'll stop right here. Download and start gaining points. Shein gives back too."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Everything I have ordered has been as described and shown. Usually, I received the items in a timely manner. Only wish it was easier to find petite sizes without having to go through all their options"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Every item is exactly what I was hoping for. The reviews on every item are always helpful and help with the size I purchase. Something will say two weeks to deliver and I end up receiving it earlier every time.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Don't know if anybody realizes, but this app steals your data. I mean, it's really no big surprise. All apps made by Chinese companies are data miners, but when you open the Shein app, it pastes from your clipboard. So, that's kind of a huge let down. Imagine how else this app is being intrusive? If you have this app, just copy the Tiananmen Square copy pasta, kill the app then open the app again, then just uninstall. Stick to using the website."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Really enjoyed the easy flow of the app. I was able to find a few nice outfits. Pricing on the app was pretty decent. Shipping can be quick or a little slow...as per expected with covid-19. ✌️
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,SHEIN has terrible customer service. I returned two items and was refunded for an item that I kept and not for the item I sent back. When I reached out to customer service they claimed that it was my fault that I had requested to have the item returned. However it was their warehouse that reported that they got a shirt they never got and then they did not get a dress that they did get. I will never order from SHEIN again as they have been unable to fix the problem.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Buyer Beware! Products are cheaply priced and are good enough quality. The only issue I have is that if there is a problem - they are almost IMPOSSIBLE to reach. Their customer service is via chat, but be aware - you will get caught in a loop. When my package was showing delivered (in a totally different city from where I lived) it took months to get a refund - and that's only because my bank got involved. So basically it's a good company - until something goes wrong."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The only problem that I see is that you get so many emails sometimes two three a day which makes it very hard because if you find something then you have to turn around and order again for me if I got emails at least twice a week I would be happy with that product a pretty good I just have to be careful what size is because I've ordered larges and when it received to the house doesn't look large looks more like a small or even a medium so there has to be a little more caution placed spies
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After ordering twice, I ordered again and included some birthday gifts for my husband. They canceled my order saying I failed some sort of risk verification even though I sent them the paperwork. There was no real explanation why they did this in the first place. Now the money that was already taken from my bank is tied up and I still don't have a gift for my husband. THANKS SHEIN!!!! I'm in the Philippines for awhile, I thought Shein was the answer for finding clothes my size. Not any more!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"She&In app comes with a lot of perk and has a cheerful feel to it. Could be more user friendly, if the selection fields were more specific, as tons of products show up."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Nice, occasionally cheap clothes, alternative and not, i love the new ""boards"" feature so u can organize ur wishlist and put boards for gifts for friends and ect, ships acceptionally fast, unless youre impaitent, shipping is pretty cheap if u cant pay 29-50usd on a order. Only 3-4usd. And make sure u check mesurements and reviews before buying any items. Dont expect more then your buying for. Usually its cheap for a reason."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I cannot stop ordering from Shien. They have a lot of good affordable options, some clothing can be of less quality, because the prices are lower, and less fabric kinda means a better price. I like their clothes and jewelry, but have not tried out beauty products yet or shoes. Try to size up since sizing can be different when you order from another country or online in general. Ty for reading my review ❤."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best shopping app so far. very convenient,safe, fast and helpful! ur forever customer. Still the best in 2022 but the prices really increased its not convenient anymore. I really ask Shein management to stay still on their fine quality with reasonable prices becajse that what stand them out amongst other apps."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"First time ordering. I was a bit nervous but wasn't that bad the experience. Ordered three things but one I have to return. Easy to return. Free charge of dropping of the package, near to my location from work place."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great prices, cute clothes, accessories, home goods, decor items, and a bunch more! Easy to use app, easy checkout. Shipping does take a couple weeks or so, but the prices being as low as they are, TOTALLY WORTH IT."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I was seriously impressed with the quality! Everything so far has been excellent fabric and fit! Shopping is super easy as the app is set up for convenience and gives you information on every item.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been with shein for some time now, love it! I spend a lot with big orders but I get a lot of discounts through each order and with my great level 3 upgrade I get free shipping with all the orders I put in so far that even my small orders are discounted. Love ❤️ it ☺️ my kids and hubby love 💓 when I shop for the latest 😍 fashions on this site !!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I bought clothes off of their site and never received my order. They delivered it to the wrong address since it said that it had been signed yet I never received it. I had checked my mailbox, my neighbors hadn't received it, ect. Also their customer service is not helpful! I'm still trying to contact someone about getting a refund when it's been almost a WEEK from this incident. 😡"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very wide selection in all fields, clothes shoes bags etc. Very reasonably priced, placed my first order a few days ago got the free shipping and my package arrived today, a week earlier than it was estimated to arrive. Customer reviews and app are extremely helpful and I recommend checking reviews prior to purchasing to get an understanding on quality because some things are gems and others are not."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is a great app, but you have to be careful. If you get points, then you log out or log in on another device, it will delete all of your points. I have 456, then I logged in on my computer and all of the stuff in my wish list and my points were gone. I am disappointed with that. But everything else is great."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein, I really do. They have the cutest stuff from clothes, jewelry, home decor, and they even have kid stuff and men clothing too! The prices are so affordable, which I love and they are always having sales/price cuts! I also love the fact that you can have a Wishlist- you can save all the items you love or want to buy in the future. The only negative thing I have to say about Shein is the customer service, not reliable in my opinion. Love it all in all(:"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love their.concept of selling... their Flash Sales, Points System, Card discounts, Instalment and Voucher options. Love the whole idea of selling stuff in innovative ways and keeping customers.hooked.to this app for buying on regular basis. They have separate.category for plus people and that makes life so easy and comfy where I dont need to step out anywhere to buy anything as I get all my kind of clothes.at one stop.Their dresse's quality is top notch with affordable prices except sometimes."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely uselss service. My return is lying at my place since last one month and there id no support through customer service also. Pick up guy, calls and informs that this is not my area and denies picking up the stuff on daily basis. And no refund is generated yet. Very bad management by shein. I would recommend not to use this application as the customer support is pathetic."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The product quality is really good its usually exactly as shown in the picture and the best part is that they show clothes on all coloured models (not only fair ) that is really amazing as we Indians can relate and it helps in making decisions that whether that colour will suit our skin tone or not and it also has an easy exchange and refund policy its just that they at times take a lot of time for delivery like really long.... and the product comes at different times that's really tiring
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is very easy to use and browse. The company's clothes are also beautiful, affordable and of quality. The only fault I find with the app is that the ease of use means you will be frequently browsing their awesome offerings and end up spending 😅😅"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love Shein, never had an issue, i always use the size guide provided and measured before i order and everything has been spot on, delivery does take longer than a uk based provider but its always worth the wait, when i have sent items back refunds have been quick its my go to site for affordable stylish clothing :)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely love this store, being a plus size girl, they have everything from my work attire, to a casual day, chilling in my sweats watching Netflix, to a night out at the club, hell they even have some plus size wedding an bridesmaid dresses that are stunning an good quality for a unbeatable price. I'm addicted to shopping at shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"There are so many categories to choose from. Whatever u need or want, they most likely got it. There are always great reviews and high ratings on all of the products u look at. You dont expect that since their products are cheap! I'm literally on Shein for hours on end. I absolutely love looking through Shein especially the clothing!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein it's an amazing shopping application I have ever seen, the most thing I like on it it's that when you order your items and doesn't fits you or u don't like the quality, you just do Return process and they will come pick it in time and then they return your money either in wallet ( u can use it to order next) or Credit card 💳 ( that's when you paid your order by credit card) another thing why I love shein it's because all my clothes I order them there and it always look good on me!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great experience shopping with shien. I always get good quality products and they are true to their size I love how the product are low cost and affordable to different class of person. I look forward each day to the flash sales the product are always great and unique, you will be able to find something there for everyone. I would give them five stars for shipping as they keep you informed about your package in a timely manner information on delays or delivery are related to you prompt thanks"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app, never lags, but PLEASE MAKE IT DARK MODE ACCESSIBLE! The app doesn't just allow you to browse items to buy, there are contest to enter and other fun things to do to win points which =$. But please make the app DARK MODE ACCESSIBLE!! IT IS SO BLINDINGLY BRIGHT EVEN WHEN MY PHONE'S BRIGHTNESS IS ALL WAY DOWN. It's unbearable at night. And please made moving the clothes in the outfit contests easier. Moving and adjusting the items is so hard."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love everything about Shein, its affordable, has countless options to choose from, I find sizing to be bang on, shipping time is super fast and often at no cost, packaging is great, and for the most part the quality is up there too, and then there are the coupons...all in all im a happy customer and will continue to shop with SHEIN."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I'm so disappointed.. firstly they charge ₹35/- for safe delivery of ur items but I received a broken piece (an accessory) which can't even be returned. Other than that the quality of the tops is so bad. On top of that u are expected to pay ₹65/- to return an item. If we pay a price atleast we expect the quality to be good. Please do something about that.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very simple app to use. Wide variety of CUTE clothes for cheap, both very small and petite and plus sized. Models showing off product are VERY PHOTOSHOPPED, however and look like carbon copies of each other."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The reviews for merchandise are mostly fake af, just ppl trying to get points to get a kickback. They'll post pictures of just random things and write gibberish just to add something. I like the low prices and dont expect the finest stuff, but I still like to see reviews so I can tell what the merch looks like, to tell the scale, sizing, ect. Your not going to get that here and most of what I looked at didn't allow returns so be prepared for a gamble."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love the variety and amount of new items added each day. I also love the gals section of the app. Making my own looks for challenges is tons of fun. It's like a game inside of a shopping app. There is plenty of opportunities to earn free points. Love this app
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein, I've never been disappointed. I'm very fussy and my tall curvy shape means I find it difficult to shop recent styles that fit me nicely. I've ordered roughly twelve times and always purchase a few things incase it takes 7 days to arrive and I've only returned 2 items as I ordered too small. I've ordered things for my dog and love birds also. The prices are super reasonable, theres a wide variation in all styles, styles I never see in high Street stores...wish they had a store here."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Struggles to have a site with clear separation of US-only promotions. Even check in instructions are unclear and I keep getting redirected back to the US page for ""check in cycle"" even though I meant to just use the JP one all the time. Their notifications also tend to be US centric, so do yourself a favour and turn off daily notifications or you'll have a similar problem to mine, trying to figure out what's available to you in a different region. Otherwise, sure, you can buy clothes on the app"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Wonderful !! It has an unlimited varities for almost everything , to be honest the first purchase was a piece of cake,,but i got through some obstacles during the second but was fine overall ,definitely recommend !"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love this app it is very easy to use and the products are so cute and cheep tho the quality is not very good and Shipping takes FOREVER but for the price it is Fanominal. There are so my coupons you can get and earning points is pretty easy. Would recommend if your looking for cheep cute clothes. Another problem is the returns are really confusing I tried to return some jeans and get a smaller size but I never heard back from anyone and I never got my $15 back but maybe I'm just dumb. 🤷🏽‍♀️
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Read Reviews for products and look for photos of people in the size you're ordering... sometime through fabric is stitched awkward but if you size up on some things you'll be fine. Affordable and cute. Like thrifting clothes you are taking a risk with quality but can put together some cute fits for cheap for events. Always use shein for bday fits that I know I won't wear too often so I dont wanna go to broke for. App is good and search is helpful for themes.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app!!!! I wish there were more apps like this. My favorite thing about it is that it gives ppl points for submitting a review so all the items have a ton of reviews with pictures so you can confidently buy stuff knowing that it'll be just like the description. Its prices are sooooo reasonable too. It's just perfect!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great design and affordable dresses, only if they make XS in all of the item then that's going to be perfect! I have been shopping on here for most of my wardrobe. Fast shipping too for when you needed it sooner for an occasion. o Overall a great experience with SHEIN.🖤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing!! I love shopping on this app. I'm never disappointed with the stuff I get. The sizes are true to size. The clothing material does not feel cheap. Their clothes ranges in different styles :) The clothing is good and their prices are good as well!🤑And not only do they sell clothes but they sell stuff for your house, bedroom, kitchen appliances, accessories and shoes😁And delivery is fast👍🏼definitely recommend downloading!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Poor I can not even make a purchase on regards I come from the United Kingdom and have put all information in correctly. However the phone number will not accept and is asking for a 5-16 digits which when I have entered in my own phone number which consists off 11 digits it will not accept at all there for not allowing myself to use the app at all. Need to be addressed ASAP!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It is one of the best shopping apps one can ever find... It provides you with what you desire to wear... all the pieces are quite good and one can slay their day with any of the items... it's the perfect thing for a fashionable women whose aim is to look good... I am quite satisfied with shein... You can find the dresses here which you once imagined of...
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I bought three items from shein. One did not fit well. They asked me to prove it with a measuring tape before I could return it also I couldn't figure out how to get back into the original account I had made and kept asking for instructions.They deleted the whole conversation. When I finally got back into my account that I had used to order the products, it was supposedly past the return timeframe. I got the products around July 25th and now it's Aug 26th. Supposedly 35 days to return."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I had a great experience...collection are awesome.. And prices are also affordable plus easily you can get vouchers and points which you can redeem while shopping.... And delivery takes time otherwise if you are style freak then this is perfect for you
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I ordered a dress which was on offer ""buy 1 get 1 free"" but i got a piece and moreover the quality was too cheap that u can't wear even at home. I am a online shopping addictive and never saw this type of shopping site having too cheap quality. please don't install this app and never shop on it. Trust me.... it was my first and last shopping from shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I LOVE SheIn. I would give this app more stars if I could. My entire wardrobe screams it. The prices are incredible. The quality is typically great. Just make sure you check measurements. Don't try to be a Large if you're an XL 😂. I literally spend hundreds of dollars on SheIn monthly and my husband hates it 😂 And Shein working with Afterpay is incredible. Sooo many cute summer clothes at an amazing price that doesn't break the bank!!! And their EARRINGS are to die for! Go SheIn!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Shein is awesome the clothes are wonderful and inexpensive. And their other products are great too. Every once in a while something is a little small but hardly ever. If you scroll down and read the reviews from people that bought it you can usually avoid any issues.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Clothes are all of good quality, delivery is always very quick and by having this app you can check in everyday and earn lots points to use towards your purchase. It allows you to upload photos of your purchases, and you can also see photos and real comments and opinions of others who have bought products... size guide is good and helps you to pick the correct size."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,would have gave a 5 bit havent ordered anything yet but love the way the app is set up and how they have ideas to help you create the look you want from the items you've chosen. and the only thing i would change is the size charts but otherwise app is amazing
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"SHEIN is AMAZING. Super cool stuff, lots of reviews and review photos so you can see exactly what you're getting, and everything is very reasonably priced. A highlight of 2020 has been finding this app and upping my fashion game, even though I spend most of my time at home XD."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My experience on Shein is always great. I love how I can use the app to track my purchases. Also, if an item is sold out or not available in my size I get options close to what I was viewing. Shein is the best. Just one issue. Just wish I had money to order what I need."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been buying from this online store for almost a year and maybe two or three things didn't like it . For the rest everything is good .. the prices are really good for what you get and still good quality. I hope the have an email address that i can comunicate for those who buy a lot, i know they work with emmacloth for wholesale but the emma's page and inventory is not the same.. if you SHEIN can offer a personalized help will be really helpful, because sometime i buy to re-sale.5 stars 4u"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I like shopping here then going personally to any stores in person. It gives me so much pressure seeing people around then online. I can put all my favorite clothing on my bag and just leave it for a day or two and then buy it at the end. All is affordable and great quality. Most recommend. Love it I even buy my kids their clothes. Love it.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best online store ever! I would definitely recommend buying from Shein. True to size, stunning quality and beautiful designs. In love! However, I've been struggling to change the language on the website and already sent a query on the feedback option about this. I moved to Qatar, but I don't understand Arabic, so I can't shop! ... Please help"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Honestly for an online clothing app with varied reviews I can say more than 90% of my orders are perfect fit and quality wise . The other 10% is a mix of either the clothing items don't fit my body type even though I do look into reviews so it's really just me not the clothes and app assistance in fitting sizes or the 10% is quality but item is still what is was described as and fabric feel and comfortability is subjective. However all jewelry walldecor and other non clothing items are 10/10
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Clothes are great material, jewelry is cute and shipping is sometimes faster than it quotes! Always a coupon to use and I love that it gives the opportunity to earn points and aquire further discounts from shopping and reviews. That way you know more about the clothing item, style/fit, etc."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is a great app. Easy to search for products and communication with customer service is excellent. Finding the right size of clothing is also easy as the reviews are from real customers and are super helpful. The only trouble I have had with Shein itself is with the couriers, delivery time and communication but that could just be because of my current country, South Africa. I used to live abroad in Qatar and had no problems with delivery."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein!! I've ordered shoes from you and clothes and so far everything I ordered was good quality. I have two online stores that I order from now, and that is: Fashion Nova and Shein. Also, Shein's prices is very reasonable. I also think that everything they sale is nice and fancy. I can't say that everything is good quality, but, everything that I have gotten has been good. One of the best online store apps so far. They have alot of shoes and clothes to choose as well. Love Shein!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Cheap quick and somewhat simple, it's alittle annoying trying to return stuff but whatever I need I seem to find on here. The coupons are shady, don't purchase any when your checking out. They almost got me but I made sure to review"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I LOVE SHEIN. Great quality clothes for cheap. It's fashionable. I hate how long shipping is, but it's worth the wait. Update. Once you become a regular buyer, Shipping is super fast. I loveee it!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! I'm actually addicted.. so yea.... You can't beat cheap, cute, fashionable clothes! Plus their delivery is pretty good. Sometimes it's crazy fast, other times it arrives when said. I honestly cannot complain. Way better than forever 21 and fashion nova."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very comfortable, good delivery time, cute designs, good price. Have repeatedly ordered from shein. Sometimes the fabric isn't the quality or type you expect from the images, or more sheer then expected. Still good clothing, just something to be mindful of."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This fashion brand has the WORST logistics I've ever come across. A handful of orders placed and even after receiving TERRIBLE FEEDBACK from me after each delivery, no seriousness in their delivery process. Sick marketing which is unable to handle customer specific orders, reviews or experiences. I've finally uninstalled it and would highly recommend Ajio instead. MUCH BETTER PERSONNEL."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I would have liked to give 4 stars or 5 but I rated this 3 stars because of few reasons. The most which concerns me among the other reasons is COD service. I would like to ask you to resume COD service again. Its very difficult for students like us who doesn't have any source for online payment. So if you see this then try to consider my request.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great place for inexpensive fast fashion! The quality can be up and down, so best to check the reviews on the items you're interested in. Same for sizing fits, read the size chart and check reviews for accuracy. That said, I've found some of my favourite pieces on Shein. The points program is a nice perk too!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I have ordered a lot of clothing for my grandchildren over the past months. I have only been disappointed with a few items. Two shirts that came completely see through and you cannot tell it by looking at the app one shirt that shrink like crazy and cannot be worn. And a very nice sweater that I paid a good bit for that is falling apart and has nicks all in it just from being washed once. My overall experience has been pretty great with 90% of the outfits I have purchased
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"When you order somenthing, is always, not what you were expecting some things are so not how you sow on the picture, others to Small, or large but short, ther shipping and letting you know about your purchase and time to be deliver is very good, is just the product is made very cheap."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Good app. Ordered a few items and received a bit later then expected but was happy with my purchase. My only problem with the app is customer reviews on item . Lots of spam instead of rating the product. Extremely annoying when trying to find out more
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Impressed by the quality of the garments considering the prices. I was reluctant at first, but so far the items I've ordered for me and my daughter have been as described and looks like the pictures shown. The arrival from order to delivery could be better."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Look I love shein. With every online store you need to keep an eye on the reviews and I am very picky with where I spend my money but this place girl! I have gotten such cute clothes, lingerie, jewelry, home decor, office decor all at great prices. I have purchased multiple things from here that I just LOVE! they always have flash sales of their top products almost every night selling at jaw dropping prices, they ship to me with 2 weeks (I live in Louisiana),they have awesome customer service!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Reviews are everything! If you read the reviews and if you probably review items then you're almost guaranteed to have a successful time with this app. There's a lot of well priced items, some pieces run small, and small are occasionally thinner/more see through than I'd expect much 90-95% of the time it's worth it! Whenever I've rated something a little lower then customer service reaches out and tries to fix the concern. I recommend Shein!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I haven't been shopping here long. Only ordered from them twice and am waiting for my second order to arrive, But what I have received from them I'm totally satisfied with. The pieces I got were well made and Beautiful and you just can't beat the prices Especially as a plus size woman. Sizeing can be tricky though, You have to Really check Your mesurements and that of Each clothing item AND the Fit Guide to make sure it fits the way You want it to. But perhaps most importantly Read The Reviews!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app, I use it more than the actual website. It's more efficient than the site too because you can get customer service through it (if you need that) and you get to see the ""Best selling"" or ""Top rated"" list easily. Now if only it could send me a notification when my likes/favorites are down to one and about to sell out 😅🤑🤔"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,My experience with shien is not so bad. I ordered so many things in different departments and I have got exactly what I wanted. The clothes were true size and the product Quality is not bad at all. So I have good shopping experience with shien and I will definitely be looking for some more shopping.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A great app. I have only had positive experiences with this company. It is addicting though, as the fabrics are excellent and items are true to size. Also, surprisingly low prices. Received items earlier than expected. I'm happily hooked."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I think Shein is great, it sells clothes for most sizes for both women and men. Their prices suit all pockets. You get great value for your money. The quality of their products are great 😊. Delivery ranges from 10 - 14 days, I live in Ireland so that's brilliant. You can save money when you save your points. There are always promotions and sales going on."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love shein and would recommend it to anyone that asks me. Delivery to South Africa takes roughly two weeks, so it's quite Impressive however the free shipping comes with a customs payment so be aware of that as it comes back to what you would have paid for if shipping wasn't ""free"", Otherwise its a cool site with cool merchandise."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Shein prices are increasing every day. There is no customer service. My order is stuck since 2 months in transit and i cannot cancel it because the return days are counted after order is placed. I waited for the delivery as the time is not favourable now but i got duped. Its fine if the delivery is not possible now atleast order cancel option should be given. I loved shein but i will not order anymore.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Really good, easy to use. Has a great range for plus size people and has a style for absolutely everyone 😊 its very cheap and a lot of the time the price reflects the quality but thats what you expect from a site like this. Read people's reviews for good sizing references and quality checks :)"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Just looking and I love what I see, I'm hoping the cloths are of quality. If they are I'll buy agian, if not....I love the clothing, I got my package quick. The clothing is awesome, good quality so far. The clothing has not been disappointing at all. I bought a number of thing for decorating cakes and cookies and kids jewelry. It's all very nice and good quality. You won't be disappointed, promise."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Its a very good app for shopping as you get variety of option, patterns ,designs and what not! Material and the quality is up to mark! Lovely accessories with affordable rates There is also flash sale!where the rates of clothes is almost discounted to 10-15% You can collect points also by checking in daily! Tune into daily fashion! Because it updates you about the ongoing fashion and trendtoo! Plus you can return the orders if you are not satisfied or if the package come broken!must try app!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,When I received my second package I was hooked. I find myself ordering something from them at least 3 or 4 times a month and they are usually big orders of clothing and other accessories. I love Shein because they have the best deals and really cute clothes that fit my body type perfectly... I will definitely recommend you shop with Shein!!!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have to admit I was a little suspicious about ordering from Shein, I couldn't believe how reasonable everything was and in PLUS size..Im soo glad I took the chance Shein is one of my favorite places to shop right now..I have my entire family shopping from there now! I've experienced a few misses in quality and size, but there are wayy more hits than misses..being a plus size women I'm very particular about the way my clothes fit, and 8/9 times they hit the mark..AND they always have coupons!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Giving a 4 star rating because I've ordered from here multiple times now and I've been happy with everything I've ordered so far and everything has come earlier than the given delivery time the only thing is it's hard to guess your correct size because everything is sized weird to me but just ordering Jean's and stuff for my daughter is the only thing I have a problem with so just be careful about the sizes you chose other than that it's a great website!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've found literally everything that I've needed or wanted here at one place. With a single 1 point deduction. This is all bc there's only one single item so far that they didn't carry. Wowser listen up guys you can't beat that! Totally UNBEATABLE......... so we as customers thank you 💕 Shopping less costly so more enjoyable and very pleased. Sincerely, . The Quick-Mabe Family"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's an ok app and fulfills it's purpose. It takes a long while for me to actually buy the products, because it would show me other products I might like before actually paying. In the end I've shopped for an hour before finally finalizing the purchase. That's a great strategy. I'll wait and see the product quality when they arrive"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is my second order from Shein because I was so impressed with the first order. I have 7 grandkids and Shein makes it alot easier on our budget to spoil them. Love everything so far. They also ship right away which is great especially with the holidays around the corner. I also love the fashion they have for kids as grandparents we don't always know what's hot and what's not Shein actually tells you. 😁 quality seems to be good and the price is excellent.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So far I have never experienced any problems ordering from the Shein app my only problem is that we cannot choose our preferred courier company, I personally feel that for people in rural areas in South Africa pep paxi should be made optional as in most cases, their packages are returned due to the terrible road conditions so by making pep paxi optional people would collect their packages from pep. A happy client, a happy company and this will save the company lots of money on returns."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is perfect for clothes shopping and also helpful body tools to clean yourself, it's making my gender transition much better with the proper clothes that I can never find in stores. I'm so happy I found this app and definitely gonna be buying more things in the future"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It's good for the most part the only reason I gave 3 stars is because why do yall take forever on picking the free trails especially for those like me who buy 24/7 and to get coupons is hard especially when one is on a budget prices are good most of the products I've gotten haven't been bad at all just wish yall could offer more
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Was linked to Shein by a girlfriend. I loved it from the first time I saw it. Was expecting a long shipment time since I live in the Bahamas. However it wasn't. I was not good at the description sizes, but after first order I got it down pack. Very Good quality clothing and even more affordable. Lots of styles and designs to chose from. Shoes are good quality as well. I've got my Mom, sister and daughter hooked as well. The site is easy to install and use. My favorite site this far! I love it.❤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have ordered from Shein on several occasions and I was not disappointed. I have recommended Shein to many friends & family members. The first time I placed an order with Shein it was only around $40-50, as soon as my order arrived I tried in my items. I immediately loved them all & immediately placed another order for more items. Shein has a lot of different things for all fashion types & sizes. I will keep Shein in my go to for many items when shopping."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very easy to use app! They let you know when they're having sales and they always have new items so it's like shopping from a new store every time! Plus everything is so affordable and shopping is cheap, if not free!! What's not to love?!?!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love it. They got everything from home items to clothes. Just like a department store. But the thing is, though they may not be brand names, their items feel brand! The only thing missing, are the differences in sizes between short and tall, especially for the ladies, I don't know if there's been any suggestions. If there hasn't been any, I'd like to be the first. If you need a model, I'd like to do that too."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is the best app for shopping and everything to do with fashion. however, if they can fix the problem of flash sales notification.. because i don't get any reminder s yet i subscribe to be reminded when the item is put on flash sale but they don't remind me. i love 💕 Shein so much"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I've been using shein for about 2 or 3 months now I've really enjoy using it and never had problems with it. But sometimes ONLY some clothing's don't come out as they supposed too in the image but overall it's a very good and a trustworthy Online shopping site.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Well my first time order in with thm was awesome, I received everything I ordered, I just wish thy had better deal for tha curve women's.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like this app alot. I've found many great deals. My tip is to check out photi reviews of items. They are usually extremely helpful with sizing. Also don't do express shipping. DHL will charge you extra, plus standard shipping is usually quite speedy!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,My experience with Shein has been great so far. Most of what I bought met my expectations and are good quality. I like the variety of options to chose from and reasonably priced items. They always deliver on time. Overall great... Five ✨
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"So, this store is actually a personal fav. However; Why are you guys now working with Fedex and not USPS? Every package I purchase that is ""delivered"" by them never arrive. That or they appear SUPER damaged. I'm not even using Express shipping- Always standard. ALSO: For a month I've been waiting on a package that has been sent by Fedex, it stayed on Memphis TN, never was it delivered to my place. So.. What's going on?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Terrible customer service. They take forever to ship items ship items then they take away your ability to earn points and play mini games when you complain. They would not allow me to connect my phone number to my account until I said I would contact the better business bureau and they still will not unlink my account from the phone number because it belonged to someone else before it was my number. I am super aggravated. I'll use Temu from now on.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So far I have Good experience with SheIn 🤗, I can't complain because I've never had any problems, they delivered my orders in time and other packages they deliver earlier than I thought 😍.and the quality of the clothes💯 I trusted SheIn even more, the day I cancelled my order and ask for a refund because I had forgotten to use my coupons, they refunded me my money back with no charges🤞💯. I won't stop buying from SheIn ❤️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"love the app, easy to use, displayed nicely love the fact people can post a try on or how the item is received. Outfit inspiration little competition for discounts codes. like what more could you ask for in a clothing app/website, if only all apps/websites was as good as this one. Ive not had any issues with any off my purchases. great job guys!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,My experience with using this app is amazing. Really good quality for the prices and comes within a week although could take longer but the wait is totally worth it.! I've just ordered another load of clothes for me too this time and more for my daughter love the matching mommy daughter outfits they are so cute. Definitely recommend 👌
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"My first experience with shein didn't go so well ,I never received my order, the update on the tracking wasn't on point , I was very disappointed because the items I purchased was everything I wanted and my order was sent back to the sorting center, I'm confused on how the delivery got mixed up..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great style! Most clothes I order up a size, but they are still cute and form fitting (I dont like tight clothes). Prices are great as well! They are cheap, yet not made out of the cheapest material. It's not like clothing store, however it's not the cheapest material ever made if that makes sense."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,So far so good. I've only ordered once off of here. Everything looked nice. I've put in a second order and currently waiting for it to arrive. Shipping is not super fast.....takes about 2 weeks. So just be mindful of that when ordering!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Honestly best shopping app there is! I'm usually cautious with online shopping only because the sizes for clothes arent usually accurate but everything I've bought from here has been 110% true to size. Oh, and dont forget the super cute & durable accessories!! So definitely dont hesitate to try this business out, the prices are amazingly low, especially for the quality and latest trending styles. Thanks Shein!!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very good communication with timeline of deliveries. Always received goods usually within 2 weeks at most. Quality better than most highstreet shops. Priced very good for people living on a budget. Plenty of choice. Everything on one website is nice. Appreciate the free delivery offers. Very happy i had started to order with Shein it has not disappointed. I have bought all our recent clothes from this company.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I have always shopped on shein and have all my items available and easily returned until one of.my parcel showed delivered but I never received it I have sent number emails requesting a return or refund but unto now they proclaimed that I have received the parcel and is still investigating not to mention I tried calling the numbers for the carrier but the number keep declining. I just want my items or money back. Mistake can happen with the person delivering many times I have encountered that
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Beautiful products 😍 just don't take the risk and buy something with no reviews. I also love that it's easy to find promo codes for purchases. Some people have had bad experiences, but I feel like if you look at the ratings for a product, you'll be fine. Everything I got was great!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Like shopping on this app, although many items you can find cheaper elsewhere with free delivery, also it would be good to go back and edit reviews at a later stage for items that break, or aren't suitable for purpose or great quality etc..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have a great experience showing at shein it's fast convenient and barely something goes wrong it's always clear accurate if u know ur style and have a little fabric experience u will be able to choose freely and wisely I love it they make my life easier in some stuff and help me with bonding to my teenage kids I know it's Weird but it's true I just wish I can get more deals like extra stuff
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I now shop for all my clothes and accessories, plus beauty products on line with shein. Even Xmas and birthday gifts. Delivery has improved, not such long waits, awesome. The main quality of items is much better, the reviews people leave are really helpful so as to buy the right size eg. If something comes slightly bigger or smaller, really informative seeing other buyers reviews and when they show the outfit on photos. Special vouchers for introducing others to shein would be great 👍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I am not at all satisfied with the product. I bought a handbag which looked like nice quality and pretty online. But when I got the product it was not at all like the one I saw in the picture. The quality is very bad and fabric used is of very poor quality. Size is also not the same as shown.I have returned it immediately. waste of money. we have to think twice before buying from this.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is the best app to find clothes, shoes, socks, accessories, and more! They give you so many good deals/coupons for clothes and other stuff. They have so much stuff in any style you like,I recommend shein for everyone.5 stars!😁⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Favourite shopping app! Delivery times can take a couple of weeks in some cases, but returns and refunds are completed quickly. Earn points everyday just for checking in to the app, these mean money off your orders 😊"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Sometime things are smaller than I thought but I love this app I have had it for around a month and I've gotten things 3 times just check the ratings on the items before you buy to see if it's worth it. Overall really good. But I get notifications all the time 12 times a day give or take a few.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I do like and enjoy shopping with Shein, my only huge problem is the delivery. The bags are always opened and I've had to return a couple things because the boxes are broken. But besides that the app and items are not bad. Cute clothes."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great selection and quality for the price you pay . The customer reviews do help as well as the guided size measurements. The wait for ordering is not to long and note there is a customs fee applicable. However with their vouchers, discounts and point system the whole shopping experience is worth it!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The app has proven to be extremely useful because of the great review system. It really helps to look at people wearing the same clothes. Also the customer service is commendable. A guaranteed resolution of issues within 24hours and extremely understanding staff.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,So far my experience with Shein is so good! I've only shopped once with them and waiting for my second order. The products are surprisingly great quality! I've been obsessed with Hampton Decor for a while now and every thing I ordered especially the artificial flowers are top notch. Even expensive silk flowers I have don't come close to the look of Sheins. Would highly highly recommend them to everyone!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app and have recommended it to my friends. So easy to use. Can always see at a glance if you have any offers on. Love the fact the sizes are good. As a curve girl you have a great selection and I've had lots off compliments on my various outfits.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I recently heard of Shein.. and saw they had plus size clothes for a decent price. When I got my items I was very surprised at the quality! They feel amazing! So I've bought clothes for my 3 kids and my husband is next because we all want to wear comfortable but nice clothes. Seriously, super impressed and have already made 7 purchases within the last month. I will never buy from expensive boutiques again. There is something here for EVERYONE. (Even pets). They also have home decor!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I didnt know that retail therapy was a real thing until Shein!! I love how once you add something to your cart it takes you to other similar products! I can dive into this app and forget about a stressful day or whatever the case may be and its affordable enough to actually buy a thing or 2...love it
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"this app says shipping option unavailable and i cant even check out. i tried to connect it to my facebook account but i cant verify myself because the sms verification was not sent. As for some other methods of verification, they are asking for some sort of ID proof or imp. documents like driving lincence which is quite risky to give. Overall i dont think this app is good enough to recieve even one star. My griviences are not addressed properly... Anyways one star for providing me window shopping"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The only reason it gets a 4 is because the filter in search does not always filter properly. I love Shein though. My purchases so far have been great. I just wish they had more 11wideUS sized shoes in some of the cuter styles in low to mid heel range. Right now I am addicted to Shein.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the shein app. The only thing I wish they had was to stack coupons,then they would be the best . I have like 10 coupons and they're gonna expire. Also I didn't like that I my last order the things were split into 2 and the one came like 5 days ago and the other one still hasn't arrived. And in the package there was like 3 things... That's my only problem but other than that I LOVE SHEIN because its affordable 💜"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A godsend!!!My go to place for clothes. Huge selection of clothes for everyone in the family, including the little ones. App is user friendly & easy to score bonus points that turn into cash. Their return process was easy do & I was reimbursed within a couple days and that gets them bonus points."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is very easy to navigate and much faster than the website in my opinion (may just be my computer but yeah). I LOVE the clothes and items on Shein. Ngl I think Shein is my favorite shop ever because of how cheap they are but such good quality! Never have I ever seen another store like them!! Also I promise you I am not a bot or being paid to say this. Just a broke high-school student that likes cheap and affordable fashion :3 Totally would be an ambassador for shein if they asked me.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Really love the clothing and size ranges they provide!! As long as you match measurements and look at reviews for the right size your guaranteed an awesome addition to your closet!! The lingerie is not to expensive and i love all the comfy graffic clothing they have!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am absolutely obsessed with shopping on Shein. I love browsing through the clothes, and majority of the items are relatively cheap and good quality. I love that there are so many different styles of clothing you can get so it caters to people of all different tastes. I also love that it's not just clothes and accessories to, you can also get housing items such as bed covers and lights etc. Very cool brand and I will definitely be purchasing my clothes from this brand from now on 😁"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Easy to use. Quick with orders. Very good value for money. I've never had to send anything back, and there is so much choice. Something for everyone. If you're near the end of the month and money is tight, you can use Clearpay. Absolutely love the Shein App."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very nice selection of clothing, shoes, accessories, and even some small home decor items. The reviews from other customers help allot. I have purchased many things from them and rarely go to stores because I can usually find at SHEIN."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Shein is a great app to shop on! I only started shopping for a few months and had no problem with any of the clothes and other products. The only issue I have is their tracking. It doesn't update at real time and have to guess when my package will arrive when the estimated date comes around.But other then that I recommend going for it!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app, decent prices with great selection. Only down side is that the clothing quality isn't always great... Fabrics are rough and sizing is sometimes off. I do plan to keep shopping here however, they have great deals!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This is the 2nd order that I placed that sat in the processing status for days. The live chat is a joke. It's a poorly programmed bot. I reached out to Shein via IG for assistance and was advised to cancel a portion of my order due to items no longer being available. Needless to say that my credit card was already charged the full price. I thought payments were only processed when the order was processed. I placed another order...same issue. I'm done with Shein. I don't recommend them.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"AMAZING!!! Every piece of clothing I have gotten from Shein has been perfect. Everything has fit perfectly, washes up great. The prices are also perfect. Someone had mentioned an outfit I had on and how they loved it, they said it must have been very expensive. I just smiled. I will always use this company for my clothing needs."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app is fine and majority of the things that I've bought is fine, but what I don't like is the fact that when you receive a product that is not what was being sold and you go and review it. They only allow certain things to be shown. I had bought a top that was nothing like the image that was shown. I took pictures and gave an honest review and when I post it only the review was shown not the pictures. Because of that I'm more hesitant to buy anything else from this company."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great shopping experience, goods take about 2 weeks max to arrive, quality on 98% is excellent, always read reviews before buying an item as it helps a lot if there's a review. No issues returning an item and returns are UK based if your in UK, order your size as they are pretty much spot on with sizes"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Absolutely 💯 credible. Great deals and amazing discounts/ coupon codes can be applied to already fantastically priced items. Been using Shein for a while and never had any negative experience. Issues are resolved immediately and they make sure the customer/ consumer is pleased
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I don't really buy clothes from shein bc I'm afraid it won't come as I hope , but the stuff there are good, I got a lots of beautiful and cute earnings, bags hair accessories and nail tools. It really is great 💕 you just need to give a little look on the reviews and make sure that they are what they should be and done 👍. If you add any boards make sure to set them private though and always check if you're not sure about the item or the reviews if it's returnable. I think that's it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the cheap prices! There are so many styles and options of colour along with measurements for your size which helps me a lot! Only improvement would be to reduce some of the over priced items, for example bed cover sets for £40+😬"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I paid almost $30 to get my gift BEFORE Christmas. My order has been shipped. But now the arrival date is 3 days AFTER Christmas through after the new year. I want my money back for the expedited shipping. It was the ONLY reason I ordered on their app. I will continue to rate them 1/2 star. The quality of the order is hopefully worth it. But I SHOULD BE RE IMBURSED FOR THE SHIPPING. I didn't have any engraving or anything. There is NO reason why it is not here.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a very good shopping site I do wish that they had more stores in different places like America so it'll ship faster, overall I like they're clothes they don't always fit but that's the price of buying clothes and not being able to try to on until they arrive."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app is unusable since you added this stupid spin to win thing trying to copy temu. I'm literally searching for travel for stuff for my holiday and it keeps coming up with this spin to win bs, and not travel related supplies? I'm deleting because it's actually pointless using it and I'll just go on AliExpress because I can actually search for what I want there 🤡🤡🤡🤡"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The shopping experience is good, customer service not so good. with so many stories of packages never turning up or even being sent, it would be nice to have a human to talk to just to make sure your package is on its way. it doesn't bother me about the lenght of waiting time, you are told this but speaking to a bot ? not helpful"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I am trying to reach you all from past 30 days. Firstly I got my order in 25 days. And when I got the order 1 item is Missing from the order. I logged this issue on the day of delivery only. Also tried reaching your customer care 1000 times. Due to this I can't return my other items also. My entire money is blocked with you. 5000rs. I WANT MY MONEY BACK. TREAT THIS VERY IMPORTANT.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the app, but it's really hard to earn Shein points. I don't mean to compare apps, but I prefer using Romwe because it's a lot easier to earn points. You barely earn anything on Shein, even though there's ways to earn Shein points they aren't very efficient. Like the review. I want to be able to use Shein points on the clothes I buy but I have to wait until after I buy them to earn those points. And it doesn't even give that much. I can earn that amount from simply checking into Romwe."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Actually it's been great! Love the prices, and being a grandma & great grandma I love the choices of outfits for my Little ones (2-6 yrs)! Only twice have I been disappointed: a green sweater & the adhesive on the press-on nails. Other then that, it's ""good stuff""! Gonna keep ordering from SHEIN!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Dresses ,price , quality ,all that is fine. But what the hell is wrong with the customer care?. I have made nearly 80 calls in less than 5 days,no one picks up. It's been so many days since I've placed order,no proper response.! No update in order status.! . I'm tired and fed up. If my order delay exceeds after certain limit, I'm not gonna pay for it. Let them contact me then!. Worst experience with shein. Not expected this from you.!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein, it has great quality, great stuff, and mostly everything is great, it has almost everything you need, and Shein is amazing, but one thing is that on tik Tok, I see that Shein has been copying some designs from other designers, and that's the only thing that I don't really like about Shein, but overall, it's amazing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love shein for cute clothes and junk I don't need that makes me happy. THE MAJOR ISSUE is it never redirects to Paypal. I can't choose a payment method, it defaults to whatever it wants. I WAS trying to save up on Paypal, but it took out $22 from the wrong payment source because there's no option. Just checkout and bam! Your order is complete."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Prices are good. Quality is hit or miss. Designs are mostly average with some gems. Shopping during popular sales is an awful experience. They pull inventory even if it's in your cart so if you hold it even for five minutes while you're still shopping they'll sell it out from under you. Also a ton on sizing exclusion on nicer styles. Good luck having something you actually like in your size. Not my favorite shopping app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"App very quick and efficient, my orders were received within 7 days(deliveries10\10). Absolutely great with deals however i would recommend that they state material type so we can order knowing what we ordering, some I items you get disappointed when you receive them. Otherwise all good and I will keep ordering from you...."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Not super happy with this company! It's sucks because they have cute stuff that is priced fairly. Also the quality is also good. My problem lies with a refund. For a lousy $19. I cancelled an item right after I put an order thru. I have been asking them to refund my card. They keep saying it's my bank but when I called my bank they told me SheIn hasn't tried to refund my card and there is no problem on my banks end. I can't speak to anyone and they just keep saying the same thing
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Everything runs extremely small... None of the sizes are true to their numeric purpose. The prices sometimes almost double when shipping and handling is added, which seems dangerously close to false advertising, in my opinion. Also, the products almost never come as described. I've bee let down by this site more often than i care to even admit, therefore I do not trust the product. Tbh, seems to be a sneaky, wannabe sly company that has made its $$$ deceiving consumers..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Merchandise is very easy to view, no delays waiting for the pages to load going back and forward. Easy payments, items quality is acceptable for the deals getting and good matching options. Fast and safe delivery ,no customs fee."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Y'all made me pay for an extra $23.49. Now why? I have no clue. Because when I added everything up I got $153.93. Yet somehow, someway the total came out to be $177.42. At first, I thought it was taxes or something. But when I went to the place order page. The total was then 190 something. They added more tax, I thought. Now my suggestion is: don't add more money to my order. Forgive me if I'm wrong, but someone either explain this to me or give me my money back."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I. Can't. Stop. IT'S ADDICTIVE! Even if you don't buy ANYTHING you can check in every day to get points, if you don't miss any days, you get BONUS POINTS. I got $2.00 worth of points in 2 weeks from just checking in. Doesn't seem like much? THERE ARE SALES THAT DROP SOME REALLY CUTE DRESSES DOWN TO LESS THAN FIVE BUCKS. I. CAN'T. STOP!!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,WOW I could and can scroll for hours making wishlists. So many different fashion styles. Curvy range is fantastic. Packaging is great. Sizing is pretty accurate. Quality for the price is great too.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app. Some things you need to read the product info on before you buy. Items are bargain prices. Delivery has been quick considering it was coming from oversees. But I believe there is now a UK branch now which has made delivery quicker.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the app, love the design, material used quality of food all exceptional only problem I've had is waiting time for shipping wish it was less then estimated and 1 time my delivery went to the wrong place and they cancelled it however the waiting does fly when I'm busy and my refund came back in a few days besides them 2 reasons I would have given 5 stars"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Luv this app.so easy to use with wide variety of fashion,household & accessories.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is extremely easy to use. I wish i would have downloaded it sooner, because i was just using the site through my chrome app, and it was soooooo slow. The app is 10/10 fast, easy to use, easy to search for things... im picky as hell, but... as of July 2021, its a great app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Only had 1 not so good item/pumps which was probably my mistake not reading the description correctly . Love the clothing varieties of different styles for all different tastes . Never had a late delivery . Points are well worth to collect .😆
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,All my packages keep getting held at the post office for no reason even though I was present at home all day for incoming deliveries. Previously packages came straight to me so what changed?? I am unable to travel to pick them up. The app offers no help for this issue. Its infuriating.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"You can find great deals and options, you just need to look really close to customers ratings, and feedback, ohh ans as well always check the size tables!!! every time!Overall... yes I like it!!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Not very good, quality of merchandise is super, but, timing in delivery sucks, out of 2 orders one big, one small both made on March 28th. I've only yet received the small order. My big order 599.00 has yet to arrive, except for a pair of boots. No way to contact customer service I've tried. Wondering if I'm going to get my package, or if I got royally ripped off."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shein is a phenomenal app! I adore the style and personalization, and all around, im severely pleased with everything..except for shipping. It does take a bit and thats the only reason I would doc a star, but sometimes the packages even come early, soo.. :)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I looooove it and i definetly recommend it to you and it is really cheap with good quality stuff and i love it so much and plus all of the things you will order will literally come within a few days and unlike other shopping apps the things you order might come after a really long time and are not like what they promised but shein is on a a whole different level and i ordered a watch and it is almost here and i am really excited for it to arrive and it only cost a little bit of money.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Some of the clothing is iffy but the app alone is really good and I've also gotten so many really cute clothes and outfits. I only give it 4 stars because you do need to be a little carful of what you chose to get but most clothes are really adorable and good quality
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am addicted to this site. The clothes and products are actually quality, shipping is FAST- no waiting months! There is a balance of cheap but amazong products and expensive things. They have so many sales and cupons that make it like a game."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's great. Everything I've ordered has stayed true to it's image. Quality is good and there were times where my items were shipped a few days earlier! Overall it's an amazing app, this is my go to app now. Everything is SOOOO affordable and cute! Highly recommend"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Could not find anything wrong with this app after 4 orders all packaged nice and all items individually packaged in nice shein zip lock bags, I would recommend measuring before buying because the sizes are true to size, great vouchers and shein points for logging in everyday so come in useful when shopping. Loads of styles for the home and wee quirky gifts make the app even better and could spend a fortune, love love love 🙏"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Sheins a good app with great quality items especially for the prices. It's really straight forward to use. Things do take a while to arrive but that's to be expected when most of its flying in from other countries
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app so much! It's been 3 months already! SHEIN is the reason why I can't save my money that much ahahha. Was tempted because of their clothes/products! Love this app because it is also COD. Earning points is so good didn't expect I could earn more by posting photos, comments and also by giving details to your measurements. Never regret installed this App, HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ONE. Love their clothes so much. Very Satisfied customer here! True to Size!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"These really are what they say they are. As a plus size person finding non-grandma clothing for a reasonable price is almost impossible. Shein makes it possible. Just be sure to check the measurements, not all 4x or 5x are the same. Also, check to see how stretchy the material is it will make a difference. I am keeping everything from my first order, waiting for my second order."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Amazing!! As long as you read the reviews on sizing you can always find your size. Not only was they fast on delivery but it was three days early and everything fits as I expected them to and have no issues.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great online shopping site. Well priced and there's everything for any style you're looking for. Every once in awhile you get something that fits a little off but you can easily send it back and get a refund.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very clever app, prob too clever - considering how effectively it's made me buy a lot of things these past couple of months! Shein may get a lot of criticism for being fast fashion, but I disagree with this - Shein is no worse than any other fast fashion retailer out there. The difference is that Shein's prices are fair for the quality you receive. I love the huge variety of colours and styles, and how it caters for small-busted women. Shein solves my wardrobe problems and I love their products."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have ordered 2x from this company.. both large orders. Everything comes in together and it all matches the photos from the app. I do size up in the clothes but the shoes are a size match. Totally worth the money! And it's great that they take AFTERPAY!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I don't think I have ever gotten an ad while using Shein, and If I have it wasn't enough for me to remember them. They have SUPER cute clothes for REALLY cheap!! They have just about anything you need on here fashion and beauty wise. I definitely recommend this app to people who want cute clothes for a cheap price!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love this app. I was never the extrême shopping type of person, but the items it advertises are exactly as they are, and the choices are endless. Coupons are always available, and payment methods help me get items and get to pay the remainder in a 2 week basis with Sfterpay or Klarna. Love the app"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent app. Works great and is very useful. It is very easy to use this app and I love all the adds, with all the sale items on. I like all the points that you can make, to bring your balance down. I am just very satisfied with all the things that I have bought from SHEIN and I love your app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The best website for shopping, great clothes, homewares and more. Free shipping and free returns, I love everything about this website. Always great discounts to be had on the site and the clothes are great quality. Would definitely recommend."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love . Great clothes for the curvier lady. Great prices. Great discounts. Great buys for household too. Bought lovely bedding, clothes false nails, make up candle holders. All sorts of items available. Easy to use app. Some items are shipped from UK and you get these quickly delivered by evrie. Other items come via royal mail. Take a time to come but worth waiting for."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! I'm basically obsessed, but there's a few flaws which may be patched, but a few days ago I was ordering when I first got my card, payment went through, and I didn't get it even after 3-4 months ish. I want a refund."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love shopping here on Shein, the prices are more than reasonable and the pieces are good quality. You would think that because the clothes such a great price, that the clothing has to be of cheap quality and once you wash it , it's a done deal; it's gonna shrink once you wash it but that's not even the case. I use to shop at fashion nova before my 11year old daughter put me up on game about Shein , since finding shein I don't even shop at fashion nova anymore"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Worst app. I haven't received any my refund money yet but the package has picked 2 months ago. Non sense . This is ridiculous. Worst thing is the order and tracking details are now not listed in the app. Ideally it should show what are all the items I purchased earlier.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this store!!!! Just read the size charts and reviews on items before buying but even if you still get the wrong size returns are super easy! Highly recommend shopping with shein!!!! I get so many compliments on my clothes that I've ordered from them
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The whole purchase experience has been great through the app. It was my first use and had to return and get a smaller size. This can be done via app and email and there's always someone replying within a day or so. Whatever I didn't spend gets into an e-wallet. As such the whole thing went very smoothly so I was really relieved and happy.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I've only purchased wigs from Shein but the wigs that I've bought are great ! They all look and feel real! The only thing that I don't like is that your rewards expire to fast. You will never be able to build your points up high. Update:4/26/22 - I am over 50 and it would be nice if Shein would do a line that was for older and more mature styles!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Awsome my experience with these people have been really good easy to get in touch with them and their answers were quick my first order had to do partial refund had it put into my wallet it was done in a reasonable amount of time and no problem get it shipped there or shipped back so my experience so far has been great thank you
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Its been a very good shopping and purchasing experience using this app. All of the order, msgs inbox from customer service, eligible coupons, and shipment tracking information is available--in a 1 stop shop location. The app is a bit better than the website. I would suggest that anyone use the app over the web."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Mostly happy some things a little small but I now read reviews for guidance. Quality mostly very good. Very affordable site and brilliant able to spread cost over a 3 month period. Easy to spend. This year we ve all needed a bit of cheer and found that's what shein has brought😂
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really do love Shein I've gotten so many amazing things from here and things that I had low expectations for that really surprised me, the clothes are always adorable and very cute, my main issue is the size chart is different and I'm not sure how to use it as I'm xs or xxs in most clothing items"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Very bad experience. I ordered products worth 1200 something. Even after 10 15 days I am unable to track my order. No date is mentioned when it will be delivered and when I tried calling on their support no one is attending the call. I have no clue when the order will reach me and for that matter will it reach or not. Highly disappointed.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app is great for women but it sucks for men none of the search results are relevant and there's just not as much choices for men in comparison to women. I searched for winter outfits and the app showed me boxer shorts fix thisss it's not just women who need or buy good clothes
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love Shein!! I wish things didn't take so long to arrive. I haven't really had any problems with ordering and sizes as long as I make sure to actually read the description and look at the size chart. The clothes are so cute and cheap!!! I love ordering from this app for myself and for family members.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is great. Fast and easy to use, much better than the competitors. I've ordered several times, everything fits you just have to note measurements in the sizing guide. The quality is very good for the price."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Uninstalled, even though there are lots of clothes I actually like the looks of and would order. However, this website only accommodates small, medium, large and extra large. I won't support a business that doesn't support ALL PEOPLE and ALL BODY TYPES. Just don't make clothes if you can't include everyone. It's 2020 inclusiveness is everything people."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this shopping app its very affordable and have nice stuff for entire family and household stuff also. I will recommend it to anyone who has not tried it as yet. You don't have to shop on expensive shopping sites or wear brand names things to look nice. Shein is for any class who chooses to shop on it and for any occasions. Your stuff usually arrives on time or even before the expected time and you can return stuff for free. I will always be shopping here once I have the finances to do i
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"horrible curomer service. i have payment issues in my order ABP72267 and instead of rechecking it they simply closed the ticket! even though i had uploaded recipts of processed payments. i was an avid supporter of shein for past two years. but now, no more. rest assured im not going to purchase anything."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I bought 20 pairs of bras and panties they fit me perfectly well. and 5pairs of sandals the size were great except for one which was a little bit small but my daughter can use it. I also bought some dresses the sizes were amazing the one with the long zipper in front and the other one with the long zipper in the back are my favorite. The shipping arrived before the expecting time. Thank you for that ❤️❤️❤️❤️.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was skeptical at first. My daughter orders from here religiously and told me I would love it to. I made my first order of 15 pieces for a trip to Cancun. Needless to say, the outfits and swimwear were FLAWLESS! I had two pieces that didn't fit and the return process was seamless as well. Shein is now going to be my go to for all the latest fashion trends with the best prices! I would encourage everyone to order from this site. Oh yeah.. they even have the cutest clothes for your dog!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Writing from India . I am unable to get to the customer care , neither using the app nor on call. I placed an order for an e gift card on 20th December and I still have no notification about this on my app or email. It was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my friend. The new year has passed and she still hasn't recieved it. Clearly there s noone to even reach out to in India. Very disappointing!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great quality clothes for bare minimum dollar. Double check the size guides for EVERY piece of clothing as the sizing can change even by updating the color. As long as you make sure the measurements are correct the clothes fit very well.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I had added some stuff to my cart and it disappeared. So i tried again, for it to happen again. I ordered 3 items finally and suddenly I had 3 purchase confirmations for all 3 times I added stuff to the shopping cart? Honestly, I'm a little uncomfortable to use this app again. Very weird that they could run my card for 3 separate transactions when I only authorized it once for the one purchase."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I still haven't received order which placed couple of months ago. Whenever I am contacting then I am getting new tracking number and it is stuck in customer. You cant talk to customer care and you can only communicate with bots. If you want to buy something from here plan it for minimum if 3 to 6 months time period (* not guarantee-time Limit may extend).
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Love the Style of clothes and the price. Sometimes the sizing is off and sending clothes back feels like too much effort. I still would recommend people to ship here again for the styles and the price.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great for a Gal on a Budget! I've had a great experience thus far & checking in everyday to get points is a great perk. Love this app & you don't have to pay all at once either. They have so much to choose from & I love that they cater to the curvy girls like me!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's kinda hard to get ahold of anyone if there is an issue. Nowhere to leave a detailed message but other than that Shein has been absolutely WONDERFUL!! Good delivery times, super affordable and I love the selection of styles! Thank you Shein!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,God awful!!!! I would never recommend anyone to buy anything from this company..they took 3 months to send me my stuff.finally got no only did both purses fall apart in only a couple of weeks but the shoes were too small and looked nothing like the pictures.i wanted a refund since it would take a half a year before i got my product and they absolutly would not refund. So yeah good luck to anyone that orders there garbage.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have only received one order but I like the clothes they're as described and the sizes are correct! A variety of clothes that are awesome at a very low price! I spend a lot of time just looking and building my list of likes and wants!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love the ability to freely shop without going into a store. Nice customer service that gets back to me in a timely fashion. The shipping I feel is great, price is great, and you can earn points. Definitely try shein if you haven't already!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've been enjoying shein but why did yall raise the shipping fee for Morocco?? Also why did you change the customs policy, the prices are already expensive compared to other countries, and even compared to local products, and then on top of that you added even more bills... That's not cool at all... 😭 Will not be buying until yall get the shipping fee to 10dhs. Sooo disappointing frrrr....."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I didn't buy anything yet but from what I seen there's a lot of good stuff and they're really cheap too some are little bit expensive but you can find way more expensive clothes in that at a store and they are giving a card for $750 for free so you can just go browse in the store and buy almost everything I can't wait to sign up and get the shein card you have to install this app me and my sisters are literally addicted to this app it's just so amazing
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Best prices on clothing online! Shipping is fast. Im glad to see a product on the website and it looks exactly like the picture. App is great 👍 I use the app for login points but I prefer getting on the website for my best shopping experience. All in all great company. Shop here for bargains on popular trendy clothing !
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Can't say how much I love Shein. So easy to order and do returns... Not to mention the prices for my plus size clothing that's so much more expensive everywhere else. Absolutely love the fast shipping. It used to take almost a month, but now it's here in a week maybe a week and a half... With standard shipping!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great experience with Shein as the app is easy to navigate. Love that it has updated reviews so you would have an idea of the item that you are going to buy. Shipping is also earlier that I have expected. I will recommend Shein to my friends.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I LOVE IT! Shein is the first ever online shopping app which made me so passionate about the new styles and trends. Though, there's one thing that can be improved, is that, if they give us the fast delivery option as sometimes, some things are urgent. All in all, I'm in love with Shein!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"SG NOTE9 - It's been a yr since I've ordered, so my experience has been complete 5 ⭐ service. All items arrived early from original time expected. Packaging was on point. I read reviews as guidance so 2 out 16 fitted a bit tight. I still chose to keep to use after weight loss. My mix order were exercise products, shoes, purses, undergarments, clothes. Will order again. Individual product reviews TBA. Happy customer."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I'm very dissaponted it shein. At first Everything was okay my parcels arrived in time but now my parcels are always late not by 2 or 3 days but 2 weeks. I am very dissaponted and even today I haven't got my parcel but I ordered it on the 29 Of October and today it's the 28 of November it was suppose to arrive on the 15 to the 22 of November. Another thing shein must STOP working with ARAMAX cause they deliver late and the transportation fee is very high. I would highly recommend BUFFALO!!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is very easy to use, it is safe and reliable. Their logistic services are also fast. Clothing and other items from Shein are very affordable and they offer free shipping for items that reach a specific price. They also offer discount coupons. I am very happy with the service I receive from Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am new to Shein.I'm falling in love with the clothing n app.I hv always loved fashion as I get alittle older doesn't mean I hv to dress like it. I hv already received 1 order and ive placed a 2nd actually a 3rd. I may be alittle out of control. I spend quite a bit of time( hours) shopping and looking at the different things ppl post. From fashion, make up, nails, and excersise. Ive learned alot and I look forward to shopping, buying and learning more. I love that you can earn points"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"i LOVE this website and I'm very excited to use the app. I'm plus size so its super hard to find cute stuff that fits but everything I've ordered from shein has fit perfectly and has looked super cute. Very easy to use, very convenient, not to expensive. I could go for hours."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I genuinely love this app! It has its quarks just like Amazon when you are using your site to sell boutiques and other companies product. As long as you check sizes and measurements size isn't an issue. Accessories are cheap but I love the fact you can spend $20 and get a whole new jewelry collection! If you have $50 you can get a whole outfit and so many different accessories and you can get shoes. You can build your outfit on the site and know that they will have things that match well already
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,it has greay features and its a good app but please make it so that we can change the language on the apps. My mother only understands chinese so we were trying to change the app's language to chinese but it didn't let us. Please make it a feature to be able to change the language
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"When my mom told me about this shopping app. I was so happy because it is so easy to use, deals are going on all the time, a lot of the stuff on cheap and even on sale. I dont have a lot of money but shopping here I always can buy 5 or 6 clothings that are super cheap. And for being cheap it is such good quality. I love it and will continue to use it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I haven't ordered anything yet but alot of mixed opinions from others mostly good, the only issue some people have is the delivery which is understandable considering where they are based but overall the products look excellent and I'll definitely be buying soon."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is truly amazing I've purchased clothing items along with a few home decor items and I normally don't buy online at all but their products are truly worth it, and their prices are amazing! I basically buy all my clothes off there nowadays, you won't catch me at a mall as long as SHEIN is around 💯"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love this app and the quality most of the items. The packaging is great with the reusable zipper bags. But I too am irritated on how long it take you to accumulate points and by the time you get enough to use them they take the points away.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Huge selection of cheap awesomeness. Edit: Unless you want to be consistently torn away from whatever youre doing or you have orders out and want to keep up to date on shipping, turn off the app notifications. They can get very intrusive and annoying. See Shein? This is the kind of review you get when you keep asking me to review over and over even though I already have!!! 👋"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's okay. Mini game to win £125 worth of wallet credit was a bit of a con tho. No matter what was always 1 or 2 referals away and then said I can't claim anymore prizes from the game. Can't even use the vouchers I got from it without spending over 110 on a shop and who has that in this cost of living crisis. Such a shame cause I was actually rating the app for that offer before I realised its not doable without 10 referals a day. Shame you could have done something good there.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Everything is great with the app, the only thing I have noticed I didn't like, is that when you have received your order and you want to rate it (which gives you points) it does not appear anymore, at least for me, I need to access through the web to be able to do that and of course it took time to find that out."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've not long ordered my first items but can't wait for them to arrive, they've got amazing stuff on their very cheap aswell, I can understand how the shipping is £4.00 becuqse of how cheap everything is but if you order over a certain amount you get free shipping, I do like this app a lot!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Ever since I started using this app I have falling in love with it....it easy to use you can scan a photo of any kind of clothing and it will show you it it's available...I stay in South Africa and only takes 1 to 2 weeks for my parcel to be delivered. I'm very happy with shein my only problem is the Experience VAT I have to pay for every single shipment Even if I have a free delivery
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,*Wouldn't even give it a one star.* I ordered a sweatshirt from here about a month and half ago and I got what you'd probably call the worst quality sweatshirt. Anyway I proceeded to return it and the sweatshirt was picked up the next day and now its probably been a month and a half and I still didn't get my money back. Tried to contact them through in-app customer service - no reply. Called them using the toll free no. - no reply. Their customer service just down right sucks.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"One of the best online shopping sites I've ever bought from. Shipping is always early, All the way from China my stuff always comes even befor products in my own country. Shein is L E G I T . Good bang for your buck. Great prices and great quality. I could brows for hours through the millions of things they have! Also , they have after pay so even better. Always get free coupons, and you can use your points towards purchases, the reviews are all legit too."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Excellent selection of plus size clothes that are youthful. Great swimwear options for plus size women that are fashionable and body conscious. Also offers two piece swim suit options that flatter the plus size figure.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am currently in love with SHEIN. Its a great unique shopping experience. Lots of saving, coupons and even fun games to earn points for more discounts! Review your items purchases and get points that equal credits off your future purchases."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Clothes are really cheap, but they charge you a customs fee of around R27, and then you'll get SMS and phone calls from customs charging you about an extra R400 before they're willing to ship your items. So, it's better to use an app that's in South Africa as they ship from China., and you pay R400 extra for that shipping."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I've been trying to get ahold of customer service to dispute an issue as I've made a return that was confirmed received but only got a partial refund. The email the app provides expires and is no longer active after a few days then it prompts me to start all over on a different email and the cycle continues!? Where's my money?????
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love the quality of everything I've bought so far and how affordable it all is. The delivery time is sometimes quicker than expected. I also love how the app and people's reviews assist you to get the correct sizes. Best online store I've used so far.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Buying experience is great, delivery time improved but returns process needs improvement. Been trying to get return token needed to submit clothes I'm returning at the parcel shop but it seems like I'm only chatting to robots with automated messaging. Very disappointed by this. It should be as easy to return as it is to shop. Option to have courier company collect from my address should be made available."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Always early arrival of orders. The date of actual delivery of goods is always advance compared to the sked delivery of shein. Very satisfied with all the products from shein especially dresses. I love all the shein dresses design. I love shein sandals too. Nice leggings fit to my legs size and shape.very comfortable to wear. Thank you Shein. Satisfied customer here. The quality of the product is very good. The quality of cloth used is very cold and comfortable. I really love Shein products.tnx
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The clothes are good and all, but their customer care services are useless. There is no direct way to chat or call a customer care agent, and by any chance if you connect to chat, you can't really tell if you are talking to humans or bots as they never provide proper solutions. On call, you have to wait for 45mins to one hour to connect to an agent, if you are lucky enough to connect, to have a basic call. The worst support service i ever encountered. The 2 star rating is also because of clothes"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Awesome site! So happy I found it. The plethora of reviews and pictures make shopping easy. Rarely have I purchased something that didn't fit. Shopping is quick considering it comes from China. With express shipping, I typically have my order within 4-5 days. Flash sales are awesome and points to buy things! Highly recommend :)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love the selection. I couldn't find any nice dress pants for my daughter. I finally found them but loved the summer jacket outfits. She is so happy with all the different colors and tons of selections.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've only ordered a few times off the app and I love it. Sheins prices are really really nice and coupons and points are nice as well. Shein is very affordable and you should definitely try it out. It's an amazing and affordable app!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I am actually satisfied with all the products from SHEIN, so this rating is solely regarding an issue I was facing that was not attended by SHEIN's customer service. What happened was I wanted to modify the sizing of some of the items I have bought, I clicked on ""contact agent"", told them what's my issue, waited for 14 hours but did not receive any replies. System stated once products are shipped you can't modify. At this point my products were shipped and I can't modify anymore. :)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love Shein! I had my whole wardrobe taken right up from under me last year and needed to find a new wardrobe quick and decently priced but also made with quality fabrics that I can afford. The styles are completely versatile and made for every type of person out there. They also sell a ton of home furnishing items and greats items for my job that we can use for our guest in the hotel I work at. I also have gotten my entire work wear, lunch bags, sandwich bags, chair covers and more!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible experience. After almost a month of my order being placed and full amount being paid online, they have now by themselves cancelled it. The refund is not sent. Also, now that we are in problem, there is no one to help or talk or no one answering the calls. They are just plain ignoring the calls, tickets and no response. All money wasted and no order received. Pathetic platform overall."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app has none of those maddening glitches that make shopping a chore on other sites. The searches are right on with your search criteria. 8t isn't slow, or not working correctly as I find some apps to be. Plus the clothes and prices are fabulous. Five stars......"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! For some reason though, I dont have all the editing options in the create an outfit contest.I also don't have all the same clothes as everyone else in create an outfit either. Help!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I LOVE SHEIN!!!! The app is user friendly. I like how customers are providing honest reviews, pictures as well as measurements. The review feature help future consumers in determining what size to get. I've only bought items that have customer reviews on it. The shipping is fantastic and I've received my item before the expected delivery date. So far so good. Thank you SheIn for the customer satisfaction in shipping, quality of clothing, merchandise availability, etc."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE shein! I just received my first order a few days ago. I placed a pretty big order for my first time & it only cost $150 for 25 pieces & 2 of those were womens shoes! I don't know anywhere else you can shop that cheap with amazing quality & TONS to choose from!! I'm definitely a loyal customer!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,ilove the choice of clothing. And the prices are good but i do find the ordering process isnt very smooth. Its hart to go back and add coupons or promos . I also dont like how long it take to recieve items.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Always had a good experience with shein. They have so much to choose from and Always have a full basket. Very good value for money, and the points and discounts are an added bonus. Absolutely love shein."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"If you've been wanting to buy stuff from here but have been too worried because it's too good to be true, stop right there. I was thinking it was the same thing tbh but I went for it. Lo and behold IT'S LEGIT! I bought my family Christmas presents a month before thinking it would take months to arrive, everything arrived together in a week or so!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have never had a bad experience with this site and everything I've order has all been wonderul! The lace comes loose if used in the dryer but overall a 10/10 experience. The point system for daily check ins has saved me ALOT on my purchases!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app is good but why do products go out of stock within few hours? I've added some products to my cart last month and all ten of them were out of stock. They got back to stock yesterday, I added those 10 to my cart again and guess what? They are out of stock after an hour when I was about to order them! Will you guys bring those products back again??????"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love love love this shopping app so much, I'm always on here ordering clothes for my birthday they aren't that expensive and the lay out is perfect, I definitely recommend shopping on here and your order don't take that long and I find shipping is perfectly fine aswell, the clothes look just like the photos you see! 100% recommend"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I ordered from this app once. I paid so much money to get a cute windbreaker but once it arrived it was the cheapest quality. Way to small and see through. it looked like it can fit a small child rather then an adult. I'm never ordering from here again.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,So far I have liked everything I have received from SheIn. I got one top that is really cheaply made and the string that goes through front and back straps fell right out. Don't know if it is worth trying to fix. Otherwise a couple cheaply made but I switched out the belt that came with it and it looks much better. Gre
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Everything is very cheap and affordable. Haven't had something from shein that broke or ripped yet either. The shipping will be a little longer, but since they're shipping from China then it's fast in that regard! Nice"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Each section has large choice of selection. The accessories are great value for its price. Clothing need to be better quality. Return and exchange police are easy. Kids costumes are very cute
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Good quality clothes, great prices, super reliable delivery times, often delivered early. Always offer coupon's for money off, love that you can collect points and the use them to get money off your orders. Offets a size guide where you put in your weight height ect so it tells you what size too order in each different clothing type. Easy to send back If needed. Overall a brilliant company."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The shipping is great. The sizes for dresses and tops are also pretty accurate. I do have a hard time with the pants and jeans, they are really skinny at the waist and none will fit my waist size but other than that, I think the site if great!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I'm very upset with this app as I have tried contacting support multiple multiple times and just got the bot saying the same thing over and over again to me, I sent all my returns in the same box, TAPED and they said one of the items (a sweater) didn't get received even though it was in the same box? So they didn't send me my full refund amount which I'm still waiting to see apear on my bank account"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shein is very efficient ,reliable ,professional and informative. One is kept up to date with tracking service is generally swift. I do however prefer Buffalo service as I feel is more affordable as opposed to aramex pricing. The quality of clothing is 95percent of thr time of a high standard and good quality. Shoes are fantastic and quality 10/10."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The clothing itself gets five stars no doubt BUT if u are a loyal customer then beware of the VIP program where u r promised perks and special offers with levels ranging from 1-4, the problem is although u spend plenty of money they don't level u up accordingly. I was told that I would not level up again until May when I have been purchasing from them since the beginning of January so pretty much makes it impossible to level up beyond level two bc it automatically renews every year!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,My experience using this app has been easy with no issues to date. Clothes purchased have been delivered during the time frames every time and I've never been disappointed in the sizes and quality.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,There are some items in my cart which are under buy 3 for 999 but when i added these in my cart it is showing there regular price and not the discounted one. I message shein india on Instagram. They asked for my email id and then told me that there is no shein account with my email id. I even sent them a screenshot but they said the same thing. Please help. I have shopped before from other account and never faced any issue
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love So many items to choose from. Love the options that come up also when looking at a particular item that come up as recommended. I've found lots of lovely pieces for all seasons.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great items, I don't really have any adds popping up using this online ne shop mostly at the start but you can skip quite easily, the adds are only about new added items mostly or popular clothing bought. Very easy to use. Great clothing and very comfy."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I will give even less than one point because horrible service experience i have with shein. On 16th December i placed my order and still didn't get my order i can't even track it properly i paid already for the order and now no one is answering properly... I can't even cancel this order because they shown u can't cancel processing order.. even there is no customer support services properly so i am not able to find out what is wrong with my order. Please take care before you place any order.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love Shein. I get clothes for my whole family they have the cutest clothes foe my infant and toddler and my fiance has loved everything I've got him too!!! And he's hard to please😁 the sizes are always a perfect fit and the quality is great. I've definitely been doing the majority of my shopping from Shein and I don't see me switching back anytime soon.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am very happy with my shopping experience and the clothing I have bought from Shein. I feel the same as when I first rated this App. I like Shein , for the very reason, No one else can buy their clothing in the same places such as Target, Ross, Marshalls. I am sure you get the picture. :)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It is a nice app. The shopping experience is good. The shein points also give discount. But i only wish it gave me a delivery date after I placed an order. After placing the order I have no clue when it will be delivered. Sometimes it is next day delivered and sometimes it takes weeks.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app, great experience. Fuss-free returns from Singapore. There's also a range of clothes from super cheap to quite pricey. And the athletic wear selection is good enough that I Dont care to look at the massively overpriced Nike, Adidas or the LULu lemon."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"- Why do u put in lucky draw some items if those items will be never won? How i can see no one won anything from that. Just coupons which u can use if u purchase more than 500, Amazing trick 👏 good luck. - for shipping double price. There is shipping guarantee which i don't understand for what's that? + About quality of others shein has so many varieties of clothes and other staff just need to search. + price, every time there is sales. Also u can search by price u need."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The service is pretty good but the constant advertising is relentless! I get 4, 5, or 6 emails a day. When my notifications were on for the app, I got a dozen, maybe more each day as well. It's intense!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've bought several different items, pants, shirts, lingerie, sweaters. Other than the pants being a bit long (I'm only 5'3"") everything is great quality, fits very well and you absolutely can't beat the price."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app and you will probably find everything you want on here. If whatever your trying to find doesn't pop up in the search bar just type in another definition of if it, it will definitely pop up"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"All items except one have been exceptional, but that was because of the style of sleeve of a jersey I picked. The size guide for each product is pretty accurate and I've been able to buy with confidence"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Beautiful clothes, stunning makeup and amazing prices, but the sizes are mixed up a bit. You can get your side and it will either be bigger or smaller than you ordered it in. It will say the same size that you ordered but it is a little more complicated to find your size. I am a medium women's who has to but XXL/XL clothing because it says ""Medium: size 6"" or something like that. Overall it is amazing but they need to fix their sizing chart. -Lydia"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Great prices when I say great I mean great but it's not at all non curvy friendly so this app is great if you have a tiny waist they do have plus size but the plus size only works for mainly curvy plus sized women but its great for ordering stuff like hats or socks or over sized shirts the bottoms are a bit hard to find tho not to mention this app is mainly for trendy white girls
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love LOVE SheIN! I normally get my order delivered after ten days max! And it's easy to return an item if it doesn't fit or is defective. They have a wide range for all sizes, and the materials are mostly cotton and silk."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great quality items, great range. So many bargains to be had, orders are dispatched quickly with tracking, arriving within the date provided. Their customer service is very good, responding within the time, no fuss, very polite, and easy to deal with. The items are very good quality. Love Shein ❤️ Highly recommend Shein ."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's amazing 😍😍 I buy off it all the time even in huge bulk, and its always cheap and the correct stuff correct size and so many options to choose from ☺ ☺ Highly recommend for anyone needing/ wanting a great, cheap and fun way to shop."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I had ordered 3 items from shein last month and 2 items i ordered together which was supposed to be with no delivery charges so out of 2 i got only 1 dress delivered and i was charged with delivery fees, the other one i have no clue where it is and when i am going to receive as it been a month now. And the lastest order i received but i received defective product. I had a terrible experience with shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, with the YouTube videos I've seen with people opening their items from Shein, I didn't expect much. But I LOVE SHEIN!!! Well made, beautiful and true to size clothes. So affordable and great shpping time.I just made my second order of several items."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Overall I love Shein. The only problem I have is that when reviewing products there seems to be some tracker that flags negative words and therefore I assume you cannot leave a genuin review unless it is positive. The best thing about the website is that you can see pictures taken by customers that give you a realistic idea of how the product will look
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Cheap and cheerful clothes. Sizing does come up on the small side, but just remember to order a size up. Never had a problem receiving the parcel, and no issue when I had to return good either, although they were not free returns"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Some items are really tacky/trashy-looking. It takes an effort to find what you would wear on a day-to-day basis. I love 90% of what I HAVE bought. If you're unsure of your measurements, TAKE THEM! It's important to know how to fit the clothes to your body. Also, READ THE good REVIEWS, those that talk about fit, not just the ""like & give me points"" posts. Materials - what they look like in the picture are not always what show up at your door. I keep shopping, so obviously I like Shein! 😄"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"SHEIN has the best made clothes and styles I had ever come across and the prices are amazing. Honestly, I'd pay more. The workout wear zip up jackets are of high quality and all Sheins' items are exactly as described. I don't have to worry if they'll fit for their clothes, shoes always on target. Love the point system as well."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Beautiful clothing treats their customers great, I might look at other shopping stores but always find myself going with SHEIN for good quality and a positive shopping experience 😊 Customer service is a lot better than quite a lot of other sites, although it would be great to be able to speak with customer support when you need to, which is something that all customers like to do when they want help with their purchases.🙂"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Designs are cute. Only the fabric sometimes not good. I have purchased one maxi dress true to designs only that they did not looked good the bal. of the patern before sewing when I wear it, it looks like is has clothing malfunction because the design of the patern didn't go well. The sewing is not a problem the design of the patern was not controlled good when being sewed. Don't know how to send it back though so I keep it. But all in all was happy for their cute styles & designs"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"App is excellent, easy to use, individual measurements on each piece of clothing, extra helpful sizing guide, plus being able to move items from cart to saved list with one click is super helpful. Actually one of the best designed apps I've used."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent prices, excellent quality, can tell was produced quickly but for the price can't complain, shipping takes about 2 weeks. Will continue to order from them because do not have a lot of money for clothes and I've gained weight. Need to feel better about myself. Glad was free shipping.the garments I recently ordered were different from anything I've ever worn and they make me feel good about myself. Washed and dried well. Did not shrink nor did the threads come loose. I'm impressed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Love the app, never had a problem when it comes to my order or returns. what I hate is the fact that i often loose my points because the app has a system error. this week i never could get my points and I lost all the cummulation."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein! You can find many different items, almost anything you would want or need for a fraction of the price! Great quality too! Just buy a couple of things you like and you will see! I promise, you will continue to buy from Shein! You can use Klarna if you choose to."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app works great, and the product selection is amazing. I love shopping at shein. Their products are of good quality and are generally true to the description, sizing info and pictures."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I received my package with all I had ordered. The shoes don't fit me due to confusion on the sizes but overall the products are good quality. I love the quality of the shoes even though they do not fit. The clothes are equally good. I love the way each item is packaged individually. Thumbs up👍
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The app is useless for me. I can't set the language. I install it and it shows the local language on the ads and navigation. I can't read the local language, only English. Such a bother to try and find what I was looking for. So I had to uninstall. Edit: That does not change the ad language or category language. Setting the language to English only makes it so I can read the information about my account. Not the information broadcast on the home page or what each listing means. I wish I could set the region I want to see, then maybe I could get English."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have been buying things from seeing every since June of this year...and it took me a minute to find my right size. But everything I have brought has either fit just right or it was too big. That's OK through because I still find use for the too big items also. I just ordered several pairs of Jeans this month and every one of them fit perfectly...I so pleased with the results. And yes I have and will continue to tell all my girlfriends about Shein.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The material is very very thin like tissue paper, you can see right through, wrinkles horribly. I got a flower colored long sleeve hooded blouse, I love it because of the flowers you cant see through it and it's not hot to wear. All other clothes I have gotten...nope..the bras are very flimsy dont hold up..I got 2 dont like them..get a bigger cup size."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,You do not recieve your oackage in the time frame it says. And if you are in canada you need to pay a seperate fee from what is in the shein app. On an $140 order i had to pay an addition $40 for importation fees. I was completely unaware of this and not notified at all about it till i messaged shein asking what was going on with my order. Still have not recived my order i placed a month ago!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I loved this app and the clothes I bought, and I was really looking forward to buying more clothes! But both times I have bought off this app, my bank card got hacked!! I unfortunately won't be buying off here again as I don't think it's particularly secure."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I would like to give five stars, however, process of payment is terrible. Why I can't use PayPal as a form of payment? Why I can't change payee address if I want to buy gift from Brazilian site and send locally to Brazil when the same time pay being in Canada? I'm not in the field for understanding these unfortunate rules. Besides that you are perfect."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app has great trendy outfits make sure to read the reviews before ordering something because some things can run small or big they can also be see through the reviews on the app are usually very helpful because there are pictures included most of the time overall good place to shop.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very happy with first order. Well packed in decent box. Now placed second order because i was happy with prices, discounts, quality of goods. I usually order everything from amazon but i can get exactly same goods from shein at a fraction of the price. So im very happy or"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A great app, never faced any difficulty in adding to wishlist, cart or ordering it's pretty legitimate. Everything you order the quality of the product always depends on the price."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Impressed & Obsessed! Honestly, I wasn't expecting much, I've seen alot of ppl mentioning Shein products & posting reviews but not really taking it in much. But I'm so glad that I did! I can't get enough of the nifty little knick knacks & seriously awesome useful quality items! From clothing-costume jewelry-household items-decor even the shoes & pet care accessories! #BigWinForShein! I was expecting ""Wish"" type of duplicate/quality 🤔does wish even exist or did Shein swipe them off the map!+!+!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,delivery takes too long. some fabrics disappoint and could be better and more environmentally friendly. It's not always possible to select the star rating on the reviews and us stuck on 5 which isn't ideal.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"SCAMMERS!! They will rip you off! Spent $150 + express shipping ($13) ordering a nice outfit for a special occasion. They canceled my order 3 days later due to ""risky"" activity then claimed my bank ""refused the refund""! Spent over a week fighting them to refund my money. Said they would do it to my PayPal; then said they couldn't refund me at all since my bank wouldn't accept it (WHICH WAS A LIE)!! Still no refund and refusing to do anything about it! WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!! THEIVES!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shein designs are chic and ( if not too revealing), sometimes have the Wow factor too. The sizing is pretty accurate and the prices are reasonably attractive for the type of material given too. I love that the delivery takes just a few days. Excellent job!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"They are accurate with the size chats + the clothing materials are waoo😍!. Also their prices are very affordable. I rate it 4* because of the shipping are little too late for me personally. Also, their return policy is for first time returns only."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Quality of clothes is always horrible. I ordered 3 tops. All were not worth in quality. Worst part is they deduct an amount of pick up from your refund amount in case u decide to return clothes. They should learn from flipkart and amazon.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I recently ordered from Shein for the first time and was honestly skeptical of the low prices, sizes, and quality of the clothing. However, my order arrived right on time, the sizes were actually accurate, and I was impressed with the quality! We plan on ordering again soon!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've just discovered Shein and so far I really enjoy the shopping experience. Close are reasonably priced and there are a lot of references for picking the right size. I like how the size that the model is wearing is displayed as well.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I really like Shein. This app has a wonderful selection for great prices, and they have some AMAZING deals. My only problem with Shein is that my orders took about two-three weeks to arrive even with using the quickship option. Although, I did order over Thanksgiving break which I'm sure was a very busy week due to Christmas coming up. I will also say that I am not a fan of the fact that they seem to have no free shipping unless it is a holiday deal. Besides that, I am a big fan of Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Straight forward and easy to navigate, however would like a notification if any of my wishlist items are low in stock or an ETA of when an item would be back in stock. overall I've been pleased with all the items I've ordered thus far"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Been a customer for years now and never been disappointed with their products. Love the daily check in I've been able to used the points for purchase. All products are good quality and the shipping is fast. I love everything about Shein.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"this app is truly amazing and for very cheap prices, but the reason I gave it a 4 is because sometimes there can be inappropriate pictures and review and shein takes no notice to it, also sometimes the quality of things can be a little iffy so just look at the reviews before buying! :)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,There's a great selection of clothes I'm a plus size and they definitely cater for that including baby and children's wear also household bits and pieces. I thought it would take weeks for delivery but it really doesn't. The clothes really aren't bad quality some are really well designed and made. The website is well designed also. As well as money off vouchers each week and completions. All in all I'm really impressed.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The order process is fast and efficient. The only downside is the apps always have internal server error. Imagine when you want to track your oder, but the page won't cooperate."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great quality in clothing! I read the reviews/size chart and haven't had any issues so far. Only thing, i wish shipping didn't take 2 weeks. Plan in advance if you are looking for something specific for an event or trip."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Good app. Easy to use. Always has some kind of offer when you spend a certain ammount (usually over £80 or something) Alot of stuff though. Like alot to go through and look at it. It will littetally take me days to place an order lol. I like the way they do kids clothes and accessories aswell. Cute. Would reccomend this app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I used to be able to buy from shein US, but after an update they said that they stopped shipping to my area, but when I changed locations I saw they still shipped to a neighboring area. I tried contacting customer support 3 different times to see if they were able to ship to my area and all 3 times customer service avoided my question."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Top favorite app of all time. They have clothes and shoes for men and women at great prices and beautiful quality. I love SheIn because they have such a variety of lingerie, makeup, furnishings for ones home and bathroom and much more than just clothes! Great prices on jewelry as well! I highly recommend this app to anyone out there that likes to spend less & get more and still have good quality items shipped fast ! Thanks to everyone at Shein for making my pandemic days/boring life, better!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"SHEIN is a really good app, most of the time they have great deals. The clothes are trendy and nice, the shipping is really fast. Just a little tip for new buyers ""be a 100% sure about your measurements"". I also recommend the brand DAZY (korean) they have the latest fashion clothing. Happy shopping :)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This App does have many cute clothing, but my package was lost, I bought a belt and a graphic T-shirt and when I looked to see if it was delivered in February, it said it was! But I never received it. I was really bummed because there was no way to get my money back. And I really needed those two things. (I ordered in late January) my Romwe package already came. So I thought it should have came with. I don't know if I'd be able to trust this shop again."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Return system is terrible. I had to contact them at least 10 times just to get an update on my returns. The customer should receive info without contacting customer service. It is only when I contact them they issues a refund. So if I would not have contacted them would I have gotten a refund? Answer is NO. WORK ON YOUR DAMN CUSTOMER SERVICE AND REFUND POLICY
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Not satisfied at all. I generated the return request for an item. On the day of pickup I didn't even get the message from Shein that it was gonna be attempted at that day. The delivery boy came and took the wrong product as I was supposed to give that product to another one. But the point was neither did he show the image of the product nor did he check it. He just took the parcel without even checking.Due to this my two return request got failed. This is very discouraging and unprofessional.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this website and app. Shopping is so easy and their review posting is awesome! I love to research products before purchasing - and that includes seeing photos of how the clothes look while wearing them! Great prices and always great clothes.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This is the worthless site ever I seen. I give one rating for customer service. I placed the order through online payment but I cancelled with the possibility of having some problems but now one month is about to complete but refund has not been received yet and whenever I try to connect customer service they says that we can't do anything and you got your items already but the fact is I have cancelled before the deliver parcel.. Please solve my query I want my money back. I will never ever
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have been happy with everything I've ordered. The discounts and coupons are great. The app is like the website, very easy to use. I love that you can see reviews with pics of people similar to your body type to see how the clothing will look and get their opinions."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is just a good time. I love looking at all the clothes (and occasionally buying them). There is always something new. They even have fun activities like outfit collage competitions. It's a fun and interactive way to shop.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Got first order delivered just now. Worst experience ever. It was a gift for a friend and you guys ruined it completely. The package has been soaking wet for days since the metal chains on the purse have rusted and there's still water inside the purse. Invoice is also wet and crumbled. Looks like fishes in the oceans deliver your products. Won't recommend your app ever to anyone.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Most clothing a stunning but I have had the odd few pieces that are different to the picture or the material is super cheap its like a kids dress up outfit not every day clothing. Delivery is hit and miss sometimes takes a week most times takes a little over 2 weeks. My daughter is loving the app and deals.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love it!❤ Everything I bought from this app is amazing,😍 10000/10 quality also jewelry I bought didn't turn green! But one thing I hate is that it takes so long for everything to come😩 but other than that everything is good definitely recommend if you are looking for cute clothes!🛍 Also the prices are great!! Everything is so cheap I love this app!! If you are reading this you have to install this app and give it a chance trust me I'm only telling the truth also you are a amazing person!❤❤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love the prices and wide variety of style and fashion to choose from the tru to fit sizes the only thing i'd like to see improve is delivery. Delivery takes a bit of time. so i give 4 stars.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love SHEIN! Not only are their priced awesome, but they also are good quality. At least everything myself and people I know have ordered. I love the variety for women as well. On Amazon I pick one outfit and suddenly all I seem to be able to find is basically that same style. Shein throws new stuff and styles at you nearly daily and I absolutely love that!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,they send complete items including sizes and colors. and i love the free shipping they provide and the vouchers too! although it takes a week before i receive them but i guess thats okay knowing its overseas.but i hope it only takes like 4 days max! but so far so good.its a good experience for me.i love most of my orders from shein!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The selection is very nice but I ordered a suede bomber jacket but got a pair of chelsea boots instead. Very dissapointed with the service. I was so excited about it. Had been waiting for so long and this happened and charged me money for returning the wrong product they shipped.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,In the past I would have rated Shein 4 stars but only for their acceccories. My very first order of clothes was a bad experience as the material was horrible but I loved the accessories. I even opened a little pop in shop with some of the items. However the logestic company they use in South Africa is untrustworthy and I'm not the only unsatisfied customer. Anyway can't trust the company so cannot shop further on Shein which is a pity:(
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very easy as you can see! Loove it, because I see there is so many pictures as what you see! Easy to understand the details, that's it! But it'd be better if there is different sizes of each photos."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"They have clothing for extra thin and large people. They have decent fabrics and designed with a classy international look. Returns cost $7. Read the measurements that go with each size. American sizes run larger than their scale. The printed and plaid fabrics are not always properly aligned at the side seams, and the denim jeans are made for those with a flatter bottom. Motf clothing is awesome. Clothing is not designed just for voluptuous models. They have something for everyone."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app.It's easy to use and offers a wide range of products for low prices 👌. I was sceptical in the beginning, but they proved me wrong!The products are exactly as advertised, and i always get my order delivered earlier than expected. I recommend this app😍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I am giving 1 star because I am unable to place an order. I will change it to 5 stars once my order is placed. I spent an hour in finding perfect dresses for me and when I was checking out it is not allowing me to add address. It gives an error always I've tried multiple times after reinstall and by clearing cache nothing works. Fix this issue.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I liked this app until they started blowing up my phone with texts about sales. I replied with STOP and they'd simply move on to a different number and text me again. No option in the app to turn off this texting ""feature."" Installing app today."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love the clothes and coupons we get the only problem is when I get the clothes I order it's different from what was shown like it's a different material than what was expected other than that I think it is a amazing store. Thank you!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, the only thing is I could be scrolling through the dresses category and get down pretty far, if I click on a dress to get a better look at it and then go back it takes me back to the top of the list. It's just annoying and inconvenient, I still use this app though. I just wished it didn't do that."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Not even a week with it, but already made my first order. I can use Shein on my tablet but not on my phone, since I've downloaded it on my phone it keeps on saying ""Password incorrect"" and when I've tried to change it it says ""Password can not be the same as the last"" or I try to register again anything but it won't let me sign in."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I was very hesitant to purchase clothing off this site as I've been extremely dissatisfied with the quality of clothing and size misrepresentation from other online stores. However I decided to purchase a top I fell in love with and was completely surprised at the quality and size recommendation. I love this site and usually purchase everything I need from it as it has almost everything a person could possibly want. I highly recommend you try this site you won't be disappointed 🤩
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"great app honestly, easy to use, no ads or any inconveniences, i like it. But it would be easier if the sizes were in your own country way as some of us don't really know their hip and waist sizes"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have used this site for over 10 years. In the recent years and months actually, I have been able to get 12+ clothing items for under or just about $100 (including coupons and points discounted). I hadn't shopped in about 3 months and I'm now seeing how everything has gone up drastically in price. Things are over priced!!! Best bet to shop to just shop at Ross or Marshalls/TJMAXX. Same quality and you pay much less. I SAW ALMOST THE SAME DRESSES for just $9.99 at Ross!!! OVER PRICED HERE NOW!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have bought many items and they're always exactly as shown. One of my orders was the wrong item but they shipped me the correct and let me keep the mistake too. Great customer service and LOOOVVEEE the prices and fashion! They show plus size love too!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been a returning customer of Shein & Romwe for a few years now & haven't been let down yet. As a consumer it's your duty to be aware of how & what you shop for, with that being said, you won't be let down. It's imporant to be aware of your measurements & correct sizes; you'll have an even better experience this way. In conclusion, I always recieve compliments on itema order through this app. I recommend it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"For those worrying about your order not arriving, it arrives & is always in good condition but I guess that depends on where you live & your local courier. Quality? Depends on what you buy, make sure to always read the reviews before you buy it. Sizes differ from clothes to clothes, eg, XL in Tees might be US8 while XL in beachwear could turn out to be US14 so always check the actual measurements & measure your own body to find the right size."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This site is pretty nice. Quality of items are nicer than I thought. Sizes are pretty accurate. Once in a while I have to return an item for size difference. The return process is pretty easy. Chat service is the only communication. I wish that would change. Other than these things, I enjoy their site."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Shein has not disappointed at all. I love all the products I have bought for a crazy affordable price. It's easy and fast to order. Also has free points that turn into money to use in the app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Bad quality products! You can return them, sure, but it's more trouble than ordering again. They don't refund money on shipping (for the return) and have to pay the shipping again when getting new item."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Very good. Only had one faulty pair of trousers delivered. Very happy with other items and delivery. If you order cheap you get cheaper quality as expected but even then still good. Will continue to use. So far no complaints.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am not really very keen on online shopping, but found the app very useful and reliable. Delivery was made before estimated date and I could track my order the whole time. Size charts provided really helped and everything I ordered fitted perfectly."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So many amazing products, clothes, bedding, jewelry, kitchen gadgets, and so much more... for the best prices. I was able to Christmas shop and stay on budget. I received the package in a timely manner and the products were well made. They also let you use afterpay, which breaks the payment up into 4 small payments, but you get your items shipped out before you pay it all! I am very satisfied and happy I found Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this site!! Love the clothes,great quality. Don't have to wait long for delivery. They keep you updated with progress on delivery. Love checking in and getting more points to help pay. Top fashion. Excellent quality on the accessories."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely love this app. Easy to navigate and find what I need, offers a wide range of clothing to shoes, bags to make up, and accessories for women, men and children. Been using this app for a while to do my seasonal clothes haul 😍🥰😁 would 100% recommend downloading."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Good prices and quality of clothes I've received so far range from normal to wonderful. The sizing can be a little iffy. Definitely size up. But I love the app its convenient and the clothes are really cute. I recommend the app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"My 1st time using the App and my 2 Airpods were missing only cases got delivered way after the estimated delivery date. No compensation whatsoever and was told to pay R80 for returns of the two cases which will be charged on my refund amount. I would still be paying for items I did not receive but its okay, I'm just never ordering again. Thank you!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So far everything I've received from Shein has been amazing. Although I did order a choker and it broke after just 2 days but than again it was only $2. I was charged more for shipping. Other than that, I love everything I've ordered from here. I even ordered 3 sets of charms and my boyfriend loved them. Great job!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is the best. I ordered some items and it came 7 days before the estimated delivery. I also cancelled and order and they gave me a refund a few hours after. The money appeared in my account in two days. Overall one of my favourite apps and I will 100% order again
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Honestly I love how everything is affordable! And easy to search up and use. HOWEVER I can't set up my shipping address bc it won't confirm my phone number it classifies it as wrong. I've been using my cell number since 2015. This is really bothersome!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the whole app. Great design, big variety and easy to use. I seriously wanted to cry when I saw that there was a tall filter for the dresses. I'm 1.84m and I'm never able to wear/buy summer dresses because they're all too short for me. Thank you"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I like the app. But too many daily messages. Buyers should have the option to opt out from seeing EVERY Shein offer or sales especially if it isn't branded for their taste. We also don't need reminders about coupon expirations. For those that shop on a weekly basis this may be useful. It's annoying to be reminded that these coupons are about to expire. Trust seasoned Shein shoppers know if we are going to miss out on coupons, like the daily sale messages this too is so annoying when logging on."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I am extremely disappointed. It is my first time ordering from shein and I have to say this is the worst online shopping experience I've ever had. My order is super late and the customer service is some automated robot answering machine that is of no use whatsoever. I even went to my nearest post office to go check the tracking number and they say it's not trackable.i tried giving them the benefit of the doubt when I was first ordering but I very much regret not listening to the bad reviews.Nx
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love Shein. Was looking for an app for a while that had it all. Good quality, amazing prices, sales are incredible, great deals over email etc. Also comes packaged in super cute little bags perfect for organizing your closet!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The UI is not super smooth and responsive when loading large number of items.The burger nav also wasn't working well. The search bar used to not work well , not sure if it's all fixed in the recent update."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Ordering was not easy. Also on your website it kept going to Arabic even though I had it on translate to English at all times, so I just ended up translating each page on my own. Also the Billing was another headache. I also contacted you by email, twitter and Tiktok and never got a reply! The shipping better be smooth and clothes good quality or else 1 star honestly. Update 9th Aug 2022 Lowered to 2 stars. I had clothes missing on my first order. Customer service does not exist."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Ordered a a few times and had great experiences each time. And delivery time is fantastic. Love it when I get messages that items in my wish list are back in stock. Everything I have ordered have been great. Shein is my favourite place to order from. 😁
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love all the beautiful clothes and the fair prices. Just wish my package came quickly, it's supposed to be ""express ship"" and yet it will take a minimum of 1 week before arrival. Also if you do not purchase within 48 hrs. Your shopping cart is automatically cleared and your order is canceled. This upset me because I didn't remember my original items."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love the variety of women's styles of clothing. They offer something different and offer a good range of sizes and colors. Nice to see people modeling what they have purchased with honest reviews. I have made two large purchases with a third on the way. So far I've been really pleased with ordering, delivery and purchases."

I still order from them and it's spring 2022, love there pajamas, and I just bought a ripped crop denim jacket and sun dresses. Fast delivery and love this store. It's June and ordered so many long skirts and t-shirts with designs on them. I also ordered sandals I'm addicted to shein. Love this store. I still have a dress I haven't worn yet actually a gown. Shein all the way"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Most things I've purchased have been great, high quality. Inexpensive, and yes some things are hit and miss. Always check the size guides as some sizes differ from others. But I'm always happy with my hauls!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Incredibly amazing variety of clothing (in all shapes and sizes!!) for the whole family (including pets), accessories, home goods, health and beauty aids, the list goes on...at AWESOME prices. If you don't mind waiting a little bit for your items to arrive, it is WELL worth the wait. EVERY TIME I'M ON THE APP I SEE SOMETHING NEW!! ✨✨✨"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very happy with the app. I actually find it to be more user friendly than the desktop site. Quality of clothes can vary, but their returns policy is extremely easy and customer friendly."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app itself is really good! My whole family Loves Shein!! I buy birthday and Christmas presents from Shein and everybody loves them! I love that they're not just about clothes, but they have a pet and home section too! I've bought clothing for my family and friends, but I've also bought mats for my kitchen and pictures for my walls. Definitely recommend! There's something for everyone, no matter the shape, no matter style!! ❤️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love SHEIN! I'm constantly buying clothes and can't get enough of them! I recommend to clearly read reviews and look at the material of the clothing. I haven't had a bad experience at all while shopping. Will continue to buy clothes from SHEIN. ❣💕
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The products on the app and the actual products are way different. Sale clothes are of poor quality. Expensive for no reason and also long transit time. One of my order came so late, one got revoked because it was out of stock however when ordered was in stock. Does not keep correct track of products"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Always have great luck with the clothing I order. Always on point, except one time I didn't receive the right size (they sent the wrong size) I sent it back they sent out the correct one. Minor blip . I will continue to order from them."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Cute clothing for women who aren't curvy. They show all of these models being curvy and fitting into Small or Medium clothes. Nope, don't trust it as they photoshopped themselves to look like they have curves or they lied about the sizes on. Also, don't even try getting lingerie from this store. Even if you never put anything on you cannot return. The busts for the bras was hilariously small. Never ordering again and I'm hopefully getting a full refund for my 1st order. Extremely disappointed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Shein has really nice products but recently they have been doubling every item in my cart after I pay then it becomes 2 to 3 times the prices the items are its absolutely ridiculous. If this continues to happen I will have to stop ordering and start shopping in malls.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love Shein because I always receive the exact item that I ordered. I enjoy receiving coupons and updates on the latest deals that they may have almost everyday. This app made my shopping access even easier. Thank u for all the features on the app that provides me with updates on delivery dates.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I made what I thought was a good buy $750 to spend on shopping with this SHEIN app after only pay shipping and handling $5.87 tax n all but that was their trick to fraud me by being 5 transactions I didn't make add up to $230 dollars they got off me in which I managed only get back of that was $155. That's a chunk I didn't need to have taken it also makes me think that everything is a scam to hack or steal from me so on line shop with a card I'd rather not now no fun getting robbed.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great UI, easy to search, filter and navigate in and out of cart. The check box selectable filter for items in cart checkout is SO convenient and intuitive, outstanding work! You make it too easy to spend money :)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This is a great app it is also really cheap which is nice but the quality is the same! I definitely recommend. Sometimes and can be a little slow tho and if your used to Amazon shipping this takes a bit long it is about 2 weeks to ship.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love the app and never been disappointed. On top of the great prices there lots of sales and coupons available. I will definitely say to read the sizing reviews on some things. But otherwise it's perfect.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I do really love this app for affordable body jewelry, interesting decor items, press on nails, make up and a huge selection of clothing, most importantly to me plus size womans clothing. It's so important to me to see peoples honest reviews and pics of them wearing items I'm interested in with size descriptions to know what to buy and what to avoid. And the selection!!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It has the worst consumer experience of my life. The app is operating almost a scam business where there is no customer service/ recourse. I ordered clothes and finding them subpar (even for the price) I put a return request. However, no one came to pick up the clothes and consumer complaints were repeatedly ignored or I was told that the clothes are being processed when they've not even been picked up. Even after Shein repeatedly marking the issue as resolved, I continued complaining and myself"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this site. Genuine bargains and often free postage if you spend over £10. Delivery can be a little slow but tends arrives before the deadline. I've had no issues with returns and refunds. Sizing measurements are always given and I suggest you use them as clothing and shoe sizes are often mixed between American, Asian and UK. Also check household items for size and electricals for what type of plug but overall fantastic. Recommend for bargain shopping"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Bit nervous of shopping with Shein as I had never heard of them before but I have not looked back! Stylish and very cheap. Good discounts and offers. The only drawback is that things take about 2 weeks to arrive.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Wonderful array of things from ladies tops to reflective strips for bicycles. Bought lots of different things in black Friday sale 3x tops for £10 and a holder for the remote control. Arrived faster than I expected,vl good nicely packaged, really well done Shein. Would recommend."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"4 stars, Because in the ""kids-Girl"" section there's not alot of selection of denim or just jeans in general, They have great fashion in shirts and acc& jewelry but the kids-Girls selection needs work! put overall the app has good fashion selection. Cheap and good fashion."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,First of all the designs of clothing in Shein are really good... I love it... But delivery is way too late and return item policy I don't get why it's like I will pay more but in refund I get less amount...... And when I asked customer support for that they hardly replied.... Then I noticed one thing plus size clothing are really way too much stretchable.... I know there are many body types so you should be keeping different kinda products too but I hardly find any.... So disappointed....
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I just got our order for my Granddaughter who is a small 10 yr old...she fits in the 7s and 8s perfectly!!! She LOVES SHEIN even more now , and we have more clothes to order in our wish list to order later !! Best thing ever is they also have AFTERPAY which I love because we can get her clothes now but pay out the order ! Clothes are even better then expected! Only thing when we ordered 130 size they were a bit small/tight !! BUT we Love Shein , great clothes !good quality!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Unsatisfactory app. No proper response for delivery. Extra charges consisting high amount for dilevery. No tracking updates. No expected date suggestion. A large no. of term and conditions, most of them are totally extra."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Really like the variety of clothing and styles, definitely want more clothes from here. I find the jeans are great but sometimes the shirts shrink in the wash but that just means u gotta wash shein clothing together alone separate from ur other brand clothing. Great stuff tho I recommend for your money!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing app. Easy and fun to use! The quality of all their items are surprisingly good. A tip for anyone using the app: go to ur points section and do a check in every day, every point counts as $0.1 and u get a few points every check in. I saved R127 off my order this month just from doing this 🙂"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I sent an item back (Kimono size 4X) on June 5. I still do not have my refund. I uploaded the receipt that I got from the packing store. It was still showing Processing. The tracking stopped in La Puente on June 12. I have contacted SheIn more than 5 times. Can't verbally talk to someone, very sad. I think SheIn is a great company, I love the clothes and accessories, but this is disturbing that I can't get a refund for an item that was returned with Sheins label."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love the apps it's easy to use and is actually very good everything is easy to operate. And the quality of the clothes it's also good no complaints about that. Most importantly the app has everything from clothing to baking moulds and everything that you need.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It is really good for anything you want to buy and beneficial for a lot of people. I can't even describe how good shein is from close to headbands and headbands to bubbles and phone cases and all the essentials you would ever need Dante covers bed sheets it's just too good so I would highly recommend using shein. when you buy something it comes and I'm very good and usable bag that you can use for anything you want once you have received your order. So she is a really good place to order stuf ❤️
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So far my SHEIN experience has been excellent! Great clothes, affordable and sizes that fit. You have to look at the measurements. Each piece is different. I also love that real people leave reviews and photos! It makes a difference seeing the clothes on real bodies!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love Shein... I've only had a couple pieces not fit cause I didn't look at measurements just the size and you need to measure bust ,hip, waist ..I love my. Tops that I get..I bought some cool shorts with tie up details on side and they fit perfect...I shop a lot of FLASH sales and give reviews, and confirm deliveries to get points ... I've gotten free shirts with free shipping when I check and order at that time .. thank you SheIn..I will always be a customer!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love it, sometimes you get something that isn't at all what u thought but it's super cheap. It would be cool if that didn't happen but I love the cheap quick fashion. And most of the time you will love what u get just gotta read reviews more and details but they are pretty great never ripped me off or anything"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love all the updates they have now compared to the last time I used this app. The clothing are super cute and most of them are true to size however you show pay attention to the type of fabric they use because it may or may not be the kind you like, however I dont mind it at all. It's pretty amazing how you can earn points and then use those points toward your products however I only wish their was a way you could update your earned points from one gadget to another with the same account."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love the Shein app! It is incredibly well made clothing for an affordable price. This app is a must have. You can ""check in"" daily for points that you can use to purchase clothing/items from their department! Amazing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great shopping app/store!!!! Ordered 2x already. Prices are affordable. Clothes are stylish. The fit/sizing are mostly a hit. Shipping is considerably fast. Also returned some stuff already. Didn't have a problem. Overall would definitely recommend it to girls who wants to be stylish and sexy.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I enjoy this app because it's got a cool feature where you can engage in activities through the app by using their clothes to post outfits of your choosing and post them to share with a wide network. People are able to like and comment on your outfit you post and it's fun and you can earn points in the app that you can use towards a purchase.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,One of the best shopping apps ever. I have been shopping on shein for a very long time now and I haven't seen anything that I'm dissatisfied with. It has a very friendly user interface which makes browsing the app very easy and fun as well. 💙
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great App! Love this app and the WishList which you can share to people, use it all the time! And being able to save your Basket Items for a later date....keeps you updated with deals and the latest items, the search is great for anything specific....would definitely recommend!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Never had any problems when ordering or receiving the items i had purchased. I've bought clothes, makeup, kitchen stuff,you name it and never had issues using them either. They always have new stuff coming through too.. I'll keep ordering things from them as long as i can. Plus their kids and baby clothing are amazing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The app is really great. When I check in everyday I get points. the points vary day to day and you can even get 60 points. I got 60 points this week sunday and you can use the points towards purchase.The clothes displayed are the same when you order and material is of good quality.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein. Everything is a reasonable price and a lot of it is cheat but it's a good quality and product is exactly as advertised. The only thing I recommend is looking at the material of the product first, made the mistake of not checking once or twice. But other than that I love it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The best for shopping. The dressess, blouses, shoes for men and women, slacks for men and women, and even kitchen utensils are complete and all those are in good quality. Not even once that I bought from Shein that I don't like everything I bought I really liked and loved to wear and used. Thank you shein for giving us the chance to sho with a very reasonable and affordable price"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I am satisfied with my purchase. Very easy to browse and choose items. Very cheap prices. I recommend this site for friends, family and everyone. Shipping on time The only disappointment was the wall stickers I bought was all crumpled when received. I wish they sent them inside a Box. Over all I am happy. Thank you 👍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I cannot express my excitement about this app! The clothes are so reasonably priced! I've recently bought some dresses, tops, and jeans and you would not believe how fabulous they look! The jeans fit SO WELL. as a girl with an hourglass figure it's difficult to find jeans that fit in the waist and the thighs. GUURRLLL. these fit way better than jeans you buy retail!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is pretty good. Really good collection for women. Decent collection for men. Please increase varieties for Mens collection. Also, please prepare cleaner, more comprehensive size charts as it becomes a little tricky to figure out sizes. Overall, very good."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,One of the things that would be good would be a choice of size that you could search for they have dresses but you go on the site and they're everything from extra super tiny but they're usually only go up to large or extra large if you want a plus size they should have a special button to push is so it'll bring you only plus size things
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"SHEIN definitely will be the BEST app you will ever come across!! They have extremely low prices for amazing quality products, the majority of the products being clothes, but SHEIN also offers household items, makeup, and a large variety of different items everyone will enjoy."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love everything l've gotten so far.. the quality is typically good for the price, and the shipping usually gets here way quicker than expected.. I've ordered about 10 things from this site so far and haven't been disappointed yet, the size tires are pretty accurate"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing. So many plus size choices at good pricing. The material so far has been good. Only complaint is the cutest things they have are for the smaller sizes, but honestly, it's so nice to see such a big collection of plus sizes at affordable prices."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The web site is very well organized and the products are endless! You can find something for anyone and not spend a fortune. Everything I have purchased so far has been just as pictured and good quality. Love the points system too! I recommend Shein to everyone I know
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Worst online shopping experience ever,I bought a bunch of stuff which was really bad quality China made,tried to return it.....the pickup guy took the items with no knowledge of my refund,now my refund money is in the apps wallet which I cannot withdraw due to their policy of cod,no response from help line,will definitely take serious actions and also recommend other people not to use it if I don't get my hard earned money back!!!!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein. Only problem I have is not being able to reach "" customer service"" 😔 I ordered an item twice but 2 different sizes...They sent same size , really a disappointment as one of these were a birthday present. Also a leather jacket arrived with a large slit ( cut) in it, I wanted to return it, but item didn't come with return label. I also don't know what to do with the points ? What are they for? How do I use them ?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"One of my top 3 stores to shop. Delivery is usually earlier than est, good quality for inexpensive prices, everything fits right and matches description,. I am excited to get everything I order, I have never been disappointed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I freaking love the clothes! I'm a bigger girl right. and I ordered this cute fit and it fit PERECTLY! and I feel confident in it 😌 it's the perfect app to look for clothes. the shipping price is a bit much but it's so worth it. Thank you guys so much!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love that customers can leave public reviews on individual products, and are encouraged to do so, that way you have a better idea what you're getting and the size point. Fast shipping and easy to track orders until they arrive, simple return process as well"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, I've gotten things from all different categories and have not been disappointed. They have exceeded my expectations. Some may complain about the timing on shipping because sometimes it does take about a month but it is always so worth the wait that I never let the shipping effect my review. I am a huge fan. It's like Christmas every time I order. Klarna was the best thing they could have done with this app. Klarna makes it possible that this momma can get nice things too."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love everything about this app! The clothes are sexy and classy or any style you want. There is something for everyone. They are quick to ship items and are always therevon time sometimes early. My teenage daughters turn me on to SheIn, I haven't been able to stop buying things."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"East to navigate, cute clothes and good pricing. Only reason I give 4 stars is because some of the items are listed under the same description so it can be hard if you are trying to find something specific."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Even tho I accidentally put in a bad address my first time ordering and not realizing it. Shein emailed me straight away and gave me a full refund. No hassle, no need to call or anything. There was even an option to buy back all the items I could not retrieve. I read so many positive reviews. And i get to see the community of shoppers personal haul ons. Edit- I got my first shipment and I feel sexy again. Quality on point. I'm in love 😍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It has nice cloths and it does take some time to get the cloths to your house it is worth it. Sometimes it is not but look at the ratings by scrolling down in the app and read or see the cloths that you want to buy. See if they are good quality 👌 or not to srr if you really want it or just sort of like it.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app has an edge on the competitors because of the fast shipping. The return was easy and quick. I only gave 4 stars instead of 5 because of an email received about a security issue.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have been happy with every order so far and I buy for small through 3x regularly. I always check reviews for un-edited photos on non-models and to get a better idea of sizing on each item. Jewelry has been great as well.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible terrible! Ordered several things that reached over $50 and I was extremely excited for them. Took a week and a half no sign of my package. So I checked my email to track it. To my surprise it's been delivered 🤔 so I check my front porch (where they said it was) and my neighbors, nothing.So I checked my mailbox and neighbors, nothing.Oh!also it was signed for!Which I did not do.So after days of pleading for them to send me my stuff.They then just give me a refund.Never again!#TeamAmazon"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shein are trustworthy, the clothes and prices are great and great value for money, sometimes small issues with website geting stuck when u try to process a return, but customer service live chat are very helpful and suportive and usealy get the issue rectifyed 4 u v. quickly . Deliveries are dependable but u can wait up to 2 weeks for your orders to come, but they usealy come within the delivery time specifyed. Over all I would give shein a 4 star rateing and highly recommend them to a freind."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So far great. My daughter and I found cute accessories, awesome clothes,and even fun decorations. All at amazing prices. I will come update my review once my package arrives and can test the products. So far the site was nice, easy to navigate through."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Shein is an awesome app but I wish it gave more coupon because since I downloaded it I only received coupon once and it should have some more type of jewellery and some other products for example kpop items otherwise it's an amazing shopping app and I love shein it has amazing collection of cloths it's affordable and the shipping is too much I wanted to order a product that was 2bhd and the shipping was 4bhd
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have ordered from Shein a number of time and the majority of the time, the items have been really good quality. The returns process is quite easy. It does take up to 2 weeks for items to arrive but then there are times when they come very quickly. I do recommend it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love how everything is categorized it makes the website really easy to navigate. I like the variety of options you have. Also most of the items are really affordable and inclusive I really appreciate that .
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I was very skeptical about buying clothes from shein because I'm leery about certain sites advertised on Facebook but after my first order was a successful and the clothes were in great condition I was hooked. I have made 2 purchases from them and I have no complaints. Looking forward to more purchases
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love love love the way this company/website work. The discounts and rewards are such a brilliant idea and a way for loyal customers to feel positive about their purchase incentive that the actual experience is fun and rewarding even though you spend loads you feel like you have saved a fortune at the same time. I also love they measure each size garment for you to decide if it'll fit or not plus real photos and shoes are brilliant.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The app is amazing and super user friendly. I am extremely impressed at how fast my items arrived in South Africa (9 days) and at the amazing quality of each item. They also keep you updated throughout the shipment process of where your items are. They are truly amazing.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I personally love this app, but the only problem I have is trying to find a phone case that actually is for the type of phone I have, so I would really appreciate if shein could make more phone cases for some people like me who have androids, and also I have a android a some what new one it's the Moto g play 11. And also love this app NO SHADE just want some improvements that's all."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"With Shein it is a great experience, but I would have given 5 stars if they were not always reducing points which you have tried so much to gather and build up. Kindly work on this and lastly can the quality of the wears and output be more like that in the pictures presented and that worn by the models ? Thank you"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've been using this app for 3 to 6 months and I'm absolutely in love with it. It provides all type of clothes and they are with perfect prices. The clothes are very true to size and the delivery also does not take much. The offers are amazing and very convenient.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this app. The clothes are cute, true to size and affordable and get delivered within a reasonable time. Ive ordered multiple clothing items from here and havent been let down yet. The after pay options are great too if you don't have the full funds to buy what you want out-right. Highly recommend 👍🏻"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Items arrived just under a week earlier than expected delivery date. They were even better than pictures of items & really good quality, so nearly 4 times cheaper than other suppliers. Very happy will definitely be ordering again."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"HIGHLY DISSAPOINTED!!!! I had placed an order on June 2. Order #:AKK62256. I had used my 219 Shein points in that. At the time of order, the items were available. When i checked on June 10, my order was cancelled due to 1 item - ""Not in stock"". How did the app accept the order and cancelled later? And i lost my Shein points as well. I feel this is how the app treats.Either send my order or refund the points!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"My experience while shopping with Shein is really bad. I had recently ordered some accessories and when the package was delivered, some items were missing. I could not find a way to request a refund for the missing items. Please be careful while shopping from Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I really like this app shein of a thing you know but recently everything is getting complicated, I haven't seen my last order yet. The delivery service is very poor 😢 😐 I do order things from another app but whenever they rang the bell I'm not at home, they do call me but shein delivery services won't do that. I'm really disappointed 😞 😔"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It is a very bad experience.... Ordered something which is just opposite what i saw... When i ask for return they said return policy not available... I have wasted my money in these 2 items.. I even cannot use this item. Guyz don't believe in the aap They show something and send something.. I started recently shopping with this website but this is seriously disgusting. Not a proper customer support. Not listening problems what we are facing.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have bought, some things. And they have all, been fantastic, quality. But i wouldn't say this is the best app. All because you may think, you are gonna spend. What 50-30 dollars. And end up spening about. 400, and all I'm trying to say is that tjis app can be misleading and, sometimes well. From what i have read in the reviews they. Dont always, come in best quality like in. The photos, you know. So it kinda scares me that. I'm not getting what i want completely."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This is a great app I love buying clothes and many other things here. Although the photo doesnt always match the actual item once bought. In size and texture type. But I have bought some clothes that are my favourite from here. So overall a good site.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So pleasantly surprised, the orders come so quick! The stuff is cheap but really nice quality. Have ordered at least 5 times and not one single issue and been so happy with everything I've gotten! I know some people's experiences haven't been good but honestly I can't rate them highly enough!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Honestly always pleseantly surprised. Products are as described. Prices are amazing. Styles can be found for every taste. Now sure I get that maybe ethically at that price there are some compromises but I'm a big girl and I have very little funds and it is near impossible for me to find any clothes that fit so shein is a life saver.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Fast delivery. Clothes have decent quality & have held up thus far. Ive been shoping on here since last year & love it. They have flash sales & coupons all the time. I just used free shiping from a bday coupon. Check it out if you haven't already!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Clothing is amazing and prices are affordable. Have only had one disappointment, garment was to small. My daughter was pretty pleased though because it fitted her. Must also say delivery time is exceptional. Everything has arrived a week earlier than expected. I LOVE SHEIN."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've just started using it so only received one order so far..but I'm very impressed. All the tops I ordered came individually wrapped and arrived very quickly. All were cheap but looked far more expensive and were true to size. I'm going to delete the other shopping app I've been using and stick with Shein. Thank you Shein🥰
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I had a bad experience a few years ago with SHEIN and vowed never to shop there again. I bought something else from them to try again and haven't stopped since. SHEIN, you have restored my faith in you. Everything I have bought has been amazing, reasonable price and has arrived fairly quickly. I have a list the length of my arm bow to get through and buy. THANK YOU."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've never had any issues/problems with this app. I click on it and it opens right up. No glitches or freezing up. So for now it gets a 5 star. If anything changes I'll make the appropriate change to my review.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Love the clothes and pricing. Shipping can seem to take long. The clothing sizes can vary but if you happen to read reviews first for the item then it usually works out pretty well.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"it's actually better than I initially expected, it tells you exact sizes (to the cm) and the reviews are really helpful. I also like the point system, where by leaving reviews, join in competitions, etc, you can obtain points which can subtract cost off of your order:)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I made a HUGE first order, just to try a bunch of stuff out at once. Not one single thing was I disappointed with 😃 Everything was incredible. I ordered 5 pairs of shoes, all different styles, ALL OF THEM FIT! I ordered 6 different shirts, ALL OF THEM FIT! Seriously going to be addicted to this site lol. Glad I tried it out, I hate Amazon so this is wonderful."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Everything has been great! I just had one experience where I ordered a sweater dress and it was actually a turtle neck. But all the jeans, bathing suits and summer dresses I ordered are absolutely gorgeous!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very satisfied. Clothes ship out fast and arrive faster than stated, no matter the size of the order. Cute and lasting items for cheap. The App is very manageable and user friendly."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great site! I've ordered multiple times and gotten my favorite shirts from here. Great prices. Love the coupons. Love that you can see the reviews with pictures and sizes. Shipping is decent. Returns are easy. What's to not like. Also good makeup.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I bought a lot on this App it's very helpful. There's a lot of products to choose from with reasonable and affordable prices. The style is really great, you just need to read carefully what types of fabric you are looking for with your size and you won't regret any purchase."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love love love this site for my fashion needs. Its affordable. You have so many different style selections to choose from. Plus,a mom of multiple kids and constantly on the go the co-ords and sets make shopping here fun and easy. Yall help this 34 year old mom stay looking good."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great deals and quick delivery when you have the app you get bonus discounts and free shipping most of the time! Love me some SheIn!! Had to delete the app because it was subtracting points instead of adding and I emailed they never fixed it all month since they did the update on June 14th it was going crazy stuff so now I don't get a shop seeing anymore. Editing They have fixed my issues I am happily shopping again! Thank You
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"As a plus size woman, shopping for clothes that fit,look nice, and don't cost and arm and a leg has always been a challenge. With Shein I can find clothes that make me feel and look my best for incredibly affordable price and also return items that don't work out, however unusual that is."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent service, hassle free delivery. Clothing fits perfectly including the shoes. Delivery is quick via Buffalo and customs are minimal. Exceptional shopping experience. There is always something available for the whole family."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have bought from this store many times, all of the clothes are super cute! The only problem is shipping does take awhile and I have seen some small businessess show how shein has stolen products from them. Overall great stuff and comes in good shape!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The best shopping for fabulous trendy womens clothes there is online!Hands down. I prefer shopping vibtage fashion,but otherwise THIS is my go-to site! The quality AND the prices, noone compares! Noone! Even for cheap shoes they top everyobe. Amazon cannot hold a candle to SHEIN! Love loce love them!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Quick shipping and great clothes! I was a bit hesitant to buy clothes from an app as my body is a little different with sizings on most apps, but the clothes I've gotten have fit perfectly, are great quality and came quickly."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Experience was way better than using a browser it was easy to search. I only had issues getting to PayPal when purchasing but that's my only complaint. I'd suggest measuring yourself and referring to the size descriptions for the best fit. Overall experience was great.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"pretty good if you know how to measure yourself. I work in theatre so I'm well versed in measuring myself and other people. There is actually plenty of information on clothing pages in shein, enough to tell you the cut of the item, the measurements of each size, etc. I've not had problems in choosing the right size, for the most part, not more than on any other online shopping experience. Now the quality. Generally, the quality is alright, but can be iffy, pay attention to the fabric type."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm more than happy with Shein purchases! This is my 4th order and every single item I purchased is just awesome 👌. Everything fits well even shoes 👞 its as if I'm picking clothes looking at them. Everyone around me now wants me to order for them.At first they did not trust the website, now they are soooo jealous. My orders take 2weeks maximum to reach me. Only one order was delayed a bit and Shein helped me to speed up delivery and clarified to me that it was due to my country customs"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein and all of the different kinds of clothing and accessories that they carry! It's so easy to go in the App. And find a pair of jeans, and in no time at all, you find a great shirt, necklace and everything is put together! And, you are set to go out for a night on the town! Lickedysplit!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have never been disappointed with Shein. If something didn't fit right, it was usually due to me not checking the size chart on that particular item. Their stock keeps getting better and better, and i plan on being a lifetime consumer"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Loving the great choice of clothes at even better prices. Love reading the reviews to compare my sizing with others that have bought the same item. Also I find it really hard to find swimming costumes that fit and thanks to Shein I have two perfect sets !
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great for the prices had a new born grand baby girl she was smaller then we expected my sister told me to try this site when I went in I ordered 9 sets of 0-1 month they fit perfect! The only small thing I found a problem with was the ones that had the feet she's a little long so it restricted her stretching her legs out! Other then that the packaging was absolutely beautiful I think other stores should learn how to package and send items! Ordering now 😂 hahaha 👍🏾 thanks
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really used to love this app. But this week I couldn't make an order, because app wants my passport number, etc. I live in Russia, but I'm from another country. So it means that I don't have Russian passport. But this app wants from me RUSSIAN passport number. What should I do? Upd: Thanks for your reply. I really appreciate it. And I wanted to know of shein works in Russia"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It is the worst app ever clothes quality is horrible it is nothing like it is displayed in the pictures, one cannot return items also for pick up there are charges. In case of return the cash back gets trapped in its wallet so one has to buy clothes only from shein very bad customer services really irritated and disappointed. I reordered a jacket from that money and guess what including the taxes delivery and shipment charges it was amount exactly left in my wallet nice way of doing fraud on ppl"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app but the only problem Is that we cannot use more than 1 coupon in every purchase, that is very disappointing. If we can use more coupons in every purchase, the app would be perfect."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shopping was very easy, the app is organized well and the pictures are very high quality. Shipping was good after a talk with customer service on a booboo I made. My package came 2 weeks early and was nice and neat. Fit was perfect!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I made my first purchase, really smooth. I'll update as to how much time it will take. As for the app, it's very smooth I like the feature of a wishlist. Payment was super smooth. Plus BONUS!!!! The clothes are super cute. ;)."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app has notified me (in app) of any sales and coupons, which I appreciate. They have quality clothing and have exactly the style of apparel I'm looking for. Item/s arrived on time so far for me and I haven't had any UI issues at all."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great clothing for cheaper! I have heard their really cheap stuff breaks but if you pay $4 for a shirt what do you expect. I have paid around $10 for every item and it looks like I bought it from Tj Maxx or Forever 21!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love shein one of the best shopping site I've been on personally. I like the incentives it offers along with all the different categories and all their inventory is amazing. I love it.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Smooth running app. Multiple notifications a day is why I removed one star. I will have to turn off notifications. Search bar works great. Haven't had any issues.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I would rate it a 5/5 but I five it 3.5 stars because they need to have a section where tou can create a list of saved items instead of just favoriting it or adding in cart. Its easier when you can create your own organized list
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've completely enjoy the prices, and the quality of the clothing... I'm a customer for life ❤️👍 I have directed several friends to the app. They all have nothing but good comments about the items I've purchased. Love it! Love it! SheIn is definitely my go to when I need a new outfit 🥰."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Everything that I've purchased has actually fit me well. Even if it was loose or tight it still looked great! My biggest issue is finding my shoe size because I don't always understand the sizing chart for shoes lol.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This is a good app and I love the items I ordered from here. But since I updated the app here on playstore~ the images in the app won't load. I've tried uninstalling and installing again but still the same issue. I doubt that it's cause of my internet connection cause I don't have any trouble opening other sites.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's overall a good app with the shipping and stuff but you can't use all your points all at one time if it more than 7o something and they keep taking my points after I reach above 200, it starts subtracting and I'm not even using them."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"In short, unexpectedly brilliant. From fashion, to makeup to houseware. I ordered shortly after Christmas, expected to wait for a month or two, it arrived the first week of January. A two week wait and every item was perfect and just as described. Their plus sizes are spot on too!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein offers some of the best products. Clothes, shoes, pocket books ( handbags) household products, beauty accessories and more. Good price, quality and on time delivery. Check them out. My one recommendation is, I would like designers to make clothes for all body shapes. Body shapes differ with people so shold Clothes measurements. Thank you."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the interface of this app, it works really well. I'm always so happy with prices, quality of product and shipping speed. The range of styles they offer as well as sizes is so impressive. I do almost all of my clothes shopping on SHEIN now!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely love Shein ❤️ Let's put it this way, I had the best experience picking out not 1 but 2 bathing suits and got it right the first try. All because I read the great reviews! Their return process is easy and they take care of you with their points and discounts. Love love love ❤️ 😍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's good that they shipped immediately and packing safely complete. Improve on price. some shirt and shoes in other shop in lower price but the shipping is very expensive and sooo long. So I choose shein shopping online wishing on more sales discount
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Don't think twice about getting this app, it has cheap and affordable cloths and items that are made with great material! I have gotten most of my stuff from shein and 10/10 would recommend. It has a variety of things you can get for kitchen,living room, bathroom, and bedroom decor! Download it. Now. /:)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app store is amazing in up to date fashion and extremely hard to beat in pricing! They have an incredible supply of stock apparently because I've never been placed on backorder and always gotten what I ordered quickly...would and have recommended them to many others!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,App is great but it lacks many features like size exchange cannot be done we have to cancel the order n place it again and cancellations are not done after order being placed and there are no filter option in short it doesn't have features like flipkart
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"For those still doubtful of the credibility of SHEIN... This is a very legit, very affordable online shopping app. It has a big variety of things to choose from. I just think they should expand their range of electronics a little more. And stick to Buffalo Logistics. Other than that, excellent service."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love the user interphase. It is easy to use and beautiful to look at. I love the models and discriptive pictures. I love the review pictures from people who have bought. Best retail shopping app I have used so far!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Seeing is a wonderful one stop shop for the entire family. Their merchandise is always top quality at amazing prices, they shop fast & no matter if u order 1 item or 20 items, they only charge one low shipping rate. I love Shein & highly recommend them."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Very bad. I placed an order because I needed the items for my vacation but the order got delayed and I am stuck waiting for it. The worst part is that I can't even contact shein I can only speak to a useless robot. I would even understand if it was peak season. The fact that I can't even contact them and find out why theres so much delay is so annoying!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is an amazing and incredible shopping app, i get beautiful and exclusive items as seen in the pic most of them at affordable price. Shein-fashion is unique and reliable I recommend it to all my friends and loved once.❤️🤩🥳"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is only my 2nd time using the app & buying from this store. 1st time was great! Which is why I am back a 2nd time. Very easy to use great pricing & products.. I will provide an update. Once 2nd order received since I paid for express shipping this time. Should be here by 4/20/21! 2nd order arrived on time.. Today is 6/26/21 making my 4th order.. I hope this time is exactly like the last 3 on time , New items, correct size, clean, and New!!! 9-25-22 : New order let's see"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the variety of plus sizes they have, the only qualm I have is that the plus size isnt quite as fashionable as the normal size, i would love if they just offered all sizing to all clothes instead of just doing separate categories, other than that I definatly recommend this!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I'm about to uninstall this app. It's crazy how they send me numerous notificafions about checking in to receive points and each time I checked in I lose points. You guys take points away from me. The amount of money I spent on Shein yall ought to be ashamed of yourself doing consumers like that. Unless i get my points back then i'll be on pause. No customer service rep to contact about the issue. I had $3.95 to $3.84 in a day. SMH
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Most of the time the items that are on sale are almost out of stock plus, the sizing chart is very confusing. I would love to order things but don't want the hassle of having to return things that don't fit."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have loved everything I have bought. Some were to big. But that wasy fault. I only wish that some of the baby clothes I bought for a shower gift wereafe of T shirt material rather than the polyester. Nobody wants to wear that on an infant. That was disappointing. Because the look of the clothes were beautiful. I just ordered some I onesies for my daughters baby and they were made with t material. I was thrilled. Thank you. I love your stuff Shein
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Shein=Legit Thought all these cute clothes and prices were too good to be true. Was waiting for a catch but Shein is amazing. True to size endless fashions for every size and accessories to go along with it! They also offer to split up your total into 4 even amounts that you pay on every 2 weeks. What more do you want!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"@shein nice clothes but... Both times my discount and free shipping were not deducted. My first order with free shipping over $50, first time order from US and 205 shein points, my order should have been $56.80. I was charged$78.49 my second order was for Black Friday discounts, free shipping and shein points I should have been charged $51.10 I was charged $63.04"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've always received every item I've ordered and the prices are great if you don't mind waiting two weeks for shipping then you can get really cute clothes. I also like how you can receive points for your orders and reviews that you can use to discount different items that you buy.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"By far my favorite app. Never like buying things for myself because cute things are sooo expensive and I have 4 kids. Now, I can shop for myself AND my kids. GUILT FREE!! I love the fashion 😍 The reviews most people leave are super tohelpful😍 IC you haven't tried yet, try it. Only downside is how much money you will want to spend because it is ADDICTING! 🥰🤑🤑🤑"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love the cost of the clothes and mostly the choice but the sizing is the thing that puts me off ordering. I have purchased some nice items which a couple of items were too small,cannot mess about with doing all the return stuff therefore now I will be extra careful when ordering,I just like ordering a big quantity at once rather than 1 item."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was introduced to Shein in Dec. 2021 from my sister & daughter while I was looking for a dress for a family photo shoot (which turned out to be a Surprise birthday party for me!) I found the PERFECT long gold dress.The price was AMAZING. The fit was true to size ( I wear a size 2x)& I looked FANTASTIC IN IT!! I'VE BEEN HOOKED ON SHEIN EVER SINCE!!! They have the latest styles for the family, made of good quality & UNBELIEVABLE PRICES!! Now I been ordering new summer clothes! THANKS SHEIN!!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I wish I could give it zero stars. I have never dealth with a more useless and irresponsible company. They can't even bring themselves to write the address on the parcel (this happened to me in two different occasions). Their customer service is by far the worst I've encountered. I told them that my parcel was late and mentioned the mistake they made last time and they told me to sit and wait, which resulted in my parcel being returned to them only two days after I contacted them about the tardiness. Learn from my experience and don't trust them!! I'm certainly never buying anything from them!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's really disappointing to report such an experience. So I ordered a top and at the time of placing order the delivery time showed up was of 5-8 business days and it's been more that. I tried to contact the sever but then no response even after waiting for 2 days.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this shopping app. Very affordable, great deals and ways to earn discounts. Shipping is good and on time. I have bought allot from them.....swimsuits, clothes, shoes, jewelry, and home items. They have an endless selection and all sizes."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a really cheap store where it is literally everything. Clothes are for half the price you would find it in the shopping centre. The delivery is supposed to be 12 days but I ordered something on Monday and it was here on Friday. The sizes of clothes fit really well. Accessories are not just plastic, and the decorations on there are dreamy."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein. Most of my wardrobe is from here! So affordable. The Curve range is great and no other shop stocks ""my look"" like Shein does. My wish list is full! My only advice, check the fabric type in description and check height of model and size that she is wearing and you can't go wrong! I would actually do an advert for Shein, that is how much I love the company! 😍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein have a wide range of clothing and many other household goods. They are of good quality, well made and affordable. The parcels always arrive very promptly. Returns are delt with quickly. I am an avid buyer, there are styles for all shapes sizes and needs. Highly recommend Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent shopping experience. Can't stop adding to my basket. Everything bought so far has been pleasantly surprisingly good quality for the price paid. Love it, love it, love it. It has everything you could ever need or want. Delivery is spot on & everything fits perfectly. It's also full of those items you always wanted or you didn't know you needed at very affordable prices."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Site is easily navigable. Information about the item is very understandable and thorough. Reviews on items are abundant and VERY helpful, especially when the reviewer provides pics. The opportunities for the customer to interact and earn rewards is FUN and worthwhile!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was SOOOO skeptical about ordering from them until I did. I received a delivery confirmation, but I NEVER received my package. I contacted SHEIN and they got my order ($400) re-shipped to me. Im going to Vegas....for the first time....for my bday this year & I ordered all of my apparel from them. Somehow the package got lost/stolen and they made it right! I highly recommend them!! Their customer service is SUPERB! *I was NOT PAID for this review. This is my honest opinion & real results*"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Not good, I had ordered several items, not only do they run a size smaller, I couldn't even return them for a different size, or a refund. Will not use this company again, and I will not recommend to anyone, matter of fact I will tell people not to use shein. Not happy at all, plus they spam you with texts, the app spams your phone all day long. I highly do not recommend at all. Very very very unsatisfied."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great place to do online shopping. You don't get charged for shipping on each item just the one unless you get free shipping. Everything I have brought is true to size and prompt delivery.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Chance the best because they the things that are cheap that you lower the price to like $6 instead for example I want as watch it was $2 but if you go to a regular store or other online that will be like very expensive so she deserves that five star people make sure you go in style shein Empire racing does not get any ads at all
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Some clothes are very thin and shouldn't be worth the money but most of the rest of the clothing is pretty good. It was supposed to be free shipping. But when I received the order I had to pay $40 🤷🏽‍♀️which is such a surprise and a rip off after saying it's FREE SHIPPING
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I don't understand why the shipping has to be $3.99 and not free and honestly I would of bought my items but shipping is just to much money and I don't want to spend a extra $4 on shipping when I could use that for something else. But further on the app is good.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Me review got deleted the first time for some reason...i really like SheIn but the new update has messed up filtering what's in your wishlist. It doesn't show everything when using the filters. Please fix! It's frustrating. App is good otherwise.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Fantastic I've had 5 deliveries upto now and have had no problems at all, all items were lovely and fit well. I love that you can get points for purchases,games,etc which can be used against future purchases. The only complaint I have is my wishlist keeps getting longer 😂😍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Although a good site to shop variety. Rcently, i made purchase of coats. The order is prepaid. And since January 3,2020 they haven't updated the delivery status. On asking the courier service they said it is not even dispatched from seller. I'm having really bad time. I'm really disappointed. Not thinking to purchase anymore. 1 customer feedback dsnt matter to them, bt stil trying n hoping to get my order befor 13th Jan. as i got my event to wear the coats. Pls SHEIN dlvr my order. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very very good App. Easy to use. Easy to search items that you want. I didn't trust this app last few years but now am big fan and customer of them...... you can't sleep with out checking out coupons and points. Their new styles . Infact everything About this Shein app is good their quality is good and sizes also. I will use this app until further notice this is so good
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"SHEIN is a great App. I love the fast international shipping and the fact that all the items I pay for in one order arrive at the same time. Love the discount codes, flat shipping rate and free shipping on big orders!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a very nice app. I would recommend it 10/10. It's very high quality, prices are reasonable,and it's soooo trendy. The only problem is in some of the white shirts they're little bit see through. Shipping is fast, Not laggy."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely loved this app but I recently discovered a lot of the points you earn towards free money is counted as one of their ""coupons"" I lost over half of my points from the this today 6/7/23, I checked in as usual & went from 1206 points to 540 or similar, such a disappointment! I ended up placing a larger order with a competitor! Otherwise I have been super happy with my orders!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My experience with shein has been great and their products are good according to their prices. Though i want them to improve their delivery dates as it takes a bit long to deliver sometimes. You cannot need a item as an emergency and get it as fast as possible 🥺. Overall, they products are of good quality 👌"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Love it!!! I am thrilled with the items I purchased. Great quality and great prices. I will be ordering again!! Definetly better than what I was expecting. I'm now on my 3rd order and I am addicted. Absolutley my new favorite place to shop online I don't even look at other places now. Shein has everything I want and more. I actually have a couple items that seemed great then ended up being junk so I've changed my mind and probably wont be ordering as much as I have been.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have very bad experience..just waste my mony.o ordered 3 dress for my baby and all are very low quality and just after 2 wash dresses lost their color and stuff is very bad.i am disappointed from SHEIN. all products as seen in the pictures are not same like the pictures.😭😭😭😭.I will not recommend anyone to buy from here
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein has replaced Torrid as my go-to for bright, vivid colors, soft, comfortable clothing, cuurent styles and easy to use app. At this point, they have Amazon beat for shipping. As a 62 year old woman it took me a minute to figure out sizing. 😄 But pay atrention to measurements and you'll be good."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Been a regular customer for a long time but only recently downloaded the app. It's easy to use and search for items. Most products I have bought have been true to size although I do always read reviews of products first to be extra sure.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Absolutely love this app so easy to navigate and I love how you can save an item and read all reviews before purchasing. I've been using the Shein app for years and never had any issues. It's also brilliant how you earn points with each purchase. Would highly recommend this app 👌
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love shein products and the app, but as of now their courier service sucks. Kept on promising that they will deliver and they delayed the delivery for 4 days. Anyways, i am facing problem now cos it wont upload my reviews. Kindly fix it. But overall, good job shein!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,So far it's been great. I was very skeptical but I finally tried Shein and I'm loving it. I really love that the measurements for each garment are included so that I can ensure that I choose the proper size for me. No more buying my regular size I'm something and learning later that it's sized differently for so.e reason. And the jewelry is so much better than I expected.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"my experience with the app is the best, and with the quality of the clothes are the best too, I've ordered from other stores and had bad experiences order from here. just read about measures and components of the fabrics, and won't be disappoint. thank you and have a great time. 👍👍👍😊😊"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Honestly, at the beginning, I had some hit or miss items, but everything for the most part, I love the clothes and prices! I've been able to find more quality items at a great price (check reviews always) so thank you Shien!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Horrible customer service! I have been in communication for 3 weeks regarding a missing delivery. I placed an order for 5 items, 1 item was stuck in processing for 3 days while the other 4 items went to the shipping status. I asked them to cancel the eye mask before it shipped, because I ordered one from amazon instead. They told me I had to wait for the item to arrive so I could return. When I follow up with them, they give me the same reply to wait another 5-7 days then reach out to them.😡"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Used Shein twice within a year . I'm surprised by everything they sell . However , I wish there was some type of way to confirm a delivery . I get notifications on to do so ... But , don't know how to confirm . I just make sure everything is in my package and go on about my day . Unless I need to return or if something's missing . Other than that I think it's pretty cool app . I love the catering to plus size women . It's hard to find things in store for a big bust and curves . I recommend ."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"just looked thru this SHEIN-Fashion Shop. I'm very impressed about all the styles & the comments telling about how others found the fit!! I Love the different styles & sizes that are available! Since I've turned into my 60's my weight went from a size 5 or 7, but now 12-14, from Small or extra Small now Large or X-Large! I've been trying to except my body change plus I like cute clothes & swim suits. I look forward 2 shopping with you all!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love this app, I've ordered from here to many times to count and have always loved every product. This is the most affordable brand, yes it is fast fashion but if you wanna look good on a budget I HIGHLY RECOMMEND SHEIN"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love your clothing, but I just wish sizes were bigger that is offered on all items. 22/24 I wear normally. I got a 3x bathing suit that I love from you and some lingerie too 3x. I'd love tank tops etc but alot only go to 20 a 4x. 20 isn't a 4x. It's like a 1x in regular sizes. So I get sad seeing this knowing I can't order them, due to being too small. Your prices are great and your clothing is pretty."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have ordered a couple of pants and shirts from here, and I've got to say that I absolutely Love all the items. They are of good quality, pricing, and True to the pictures!!! I have received many compliments with my clothing. I will definitely be ordering more from Shein!! They are my new favorite place to shop. Thank you. I ordered again from here, this time it was about 23 items. And my most favorite pair of pants from here. . .I now own 3 pairs!!! I Love this place!! Thank you, SHEIN."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,so far so good. already placed an order the first day I used it. found several accessories I couldnt find on another website I used to buy from. selection seems wider and broader to choose from. I spend hours on this app I say shamefully. but I do appreciate that they carry items that suit my taste and style. I tried my hardest never to end up on this website but after exploring it for only a day I understand why everyone uses it and I admit I am glad I finally converted. long live shein.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Fast delivery, clear & correct descriptions of items. Cannot fault them. Clothing is well made & at very competitive prices. Nice to see things that are not on the high street. Wide range of clothing & accessories. Very good quality & service is exceptional."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love shopping with Shein I get great deals and they have so many styles for any and every type of woman not too sure about the men because I never looked for men's clothing or items but I know for me as a woman I love shein it's like getting presents every time I get my packages in the mail it's not a long wait I can track my packages easily and it's a great place to shop and a great way to save money. FYI if you want to know more about an item or clothing look at the reviews
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I don't know if it's just me your category option is pretty much useless, I clicked skincare and it showed clothing/fashion, the makeup category is not showing actual makeup but just beauty tools and nothing more. Disappoiting."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein, once they realize to use better material for their clothing, their taking over the market completely, a lot of their cloths is already a great quality level, thier pretty fast on delivery and the app is easy to use, with so many options to share your opinions and your ideas on fashion this a go to on low price cloths"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shien is a really good place to shop at, because they're clothes come in very good material. They also come as the right size, the clothes are the exact same as they look on the website. I also like how shien orders come early sometimes, or it wouldn't take too long. I really recommend shien to order clothes from, I haven't ordered anything else but I know clothes can be really good to order off of shien. (:"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Everything about this app is great. Fits perfect for all the pockets 👌 is refreshing and actual. Great dedication to X size girls,like me, with amazing outfits. Delivers on time, sometimes before you wait for. It keeps increasing the quality and variety of merchandise. Love love love"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Shein has a very extensive interesting and affordable range of products. With many offers. As long as your aware of the timescale for some deliveries as not all of my order was posted out as one as some products were from abroad and some within the uk . Overall very pleased with the quality and great value for money. Lots more on here I want to buy and just saving them I'm my favourites for now. Very happy shopping with Shein.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this site! I waited a long time to try this site as I am always wary on random ads. But after dozens of my friends and family insisted and had wonderful results I took the plunge and so glad I did. The quality of the clothes was much better than I ever expected, especially a blazer I purchased for work. This was the first place I recommended to my friend who had just taken her first office job and needed an all new wardrobe for work."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shein is speedy with deliveries, my items came 9 days earlier than expected, the app is quick and easy to navigate thru,offers and coupons are great,all shipping/purchases and availablity notifications recieved in a timely manner, the correct items and sizes were recieved, the track and trace was accurate, the items and quality are very good as were the fair prices I am very happy with the service and goods, am happy to shop with shien often."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Shein is a great fashion shopping site. The plus here is definitely access to other people's reviews as well as picture. It gives you a true understanding of what your buying. I honestly love the transparency
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been obsessed with this site for a couple years now! Not only are the prices amazing, so is the quality of the items they sell. Every order I've ever placed on this app have come WAY sooner than expected and they exceed my expectations every freaking time! The clothes have always been true to size so there's never been any confusion with ""Chinese sizes"" vs US sizing, and ive ordered as a size xs, now I'm pregnant so I've been ordering a small in maternity clothes and have not had any issues"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So far this is my favourite place to shop online for clothing wise as the range of size here is amazing. A bit expensive but worth it as most of the goods that i ordered and have already received is made of really good material and very comfortable to wear. For those plus size people who are lazy to go shopping for clothes like me, i would highly recommend to shop here instead."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great clothes! I honestly have to say that I'm super impressed with the quality of the clothes! Out of about 35 items ordered I'm sending back 4. Everything else fit/looked amazing! I usually have a very hard time finding clothes that I'm confident/comfortable in but honestly these clothes make me feel beautiful and sexy without being raunchy. Shipping was also estimated to be a week later than what I actually got it in so that was awesome too! I would suggest reading the reviews for sizing.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Had no problem ordering or paying(satisfied with items I DID receive).they were glad for that However I didn't receive all of my order and it has been 6 months and I have tried everything to contact them and couldn't even reach their cs even through email.Yet I'm bombarded by no less than 5+ text/emails per day with sale updates.I would like to make more purchases but if I'm gonna spend my $$$ and not be able to reach them when there is a problem I will shop elsewhere.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I personally love the shien app. they sell different clothes bags jewelry and ect. everything is very much affordable and and takes barely any time at all to place an order shipping is not free but that's the only thing negative thing I have to say about that app
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"You have to be really careful with the quality. There is no cotton nowhere, everything is synthetic, the clothes are lovely but the fabrics are sometimes like bathroom curtains. Images from other users help alot in deciding. But the clothes smell easily and make you sweat like crazy cause they dont let the body breathe. I love most of the things I ve gotten and I love that I can find pretty much everything. Very quick and accurate delivery."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Brilliant ☺️ I really enjoy shopping at Shein especially now that lockdown has started again. The quality of the some of the clothes are ok, some a bit better the service is very good shipping does not take too long they offer international and next day delivery. I have been shopping with them for three months and so far I am happy with their service. You also have the opportunity to earn points upload your purchases, post your own style and have people follow you there are also YouTube links."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Shopping on this app has been really nice. I love how they show you what sizes fit what size. For example: 4X (20). It's extremely helpful. You can even enter your measurements for better accuracy. Awesome app!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very nice app. I like how quick the shipping is. Tho only thing that I have to say is that there should be more clothing for plus size women. The majority of the merchandise is pajamas. Don't get me wrong, I like the pajamas, but just want more choices with regular clothing. I still love this app and will keep recommending my family and friend to join.."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"For the most part shipping, ordering and receiving has been super easy, and fast. My only complaint is that matteral wise isn't that constant, so I'd suggest reading reviews of other people's ratings before ordering anything!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love it, has almost everything you'd want at a great price, they even give you coupons and shein points which you can turn into money!!! All the products are well made and last long. Honestly my favorite shopping app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Most clothing isn't made cheap and it's at awesome prices any items that aren't clothes are relatively good quality with great prices, shoes are a little pricey for the material but other than that it's a reliable site I have never had any problems with my orders!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein has been a blessing for me. I have not bought a single dress from a store for nearly two years now.. all of them are from shein and I totally love it! Just be careful while picking out your size, as it may vary according to the dresses. If you're a M then go for a S always. Everything else is just perfect!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Easy to use love the track option and thoroughness of the return policy. I missed a discount because I didn't add it I guess so I'm still learning how to navigate the app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used to love Shein, however some of the changes made are ridiculous. The fact that you can't contact customer service anymore is sad. The fact that I have to wait 4 days, maybe longer because I'm still waiting, for a simple exchange to take place is crazy. I. Not impressed. I am also not sure why you do the free trial offer, when does anyone actually win a free trial??? Lastly the live videos why do they only have to be on Sundays, not everyone is available to do them just on Sunday."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Size exclusionary. Cheap quality. Never any pockets. Patterns are only on the front of anything leaving a cardigan to look like a cheap knockoff. But mostly all the cute clothes are for larger people. Super ugly basic stuff for small people. This fashion seller is sizest.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love how i can find so many variations of similar styles that cater to my taste. Ordering times are not too bad and more often than not sizing is very reliable! Quality is great, choice is amazing and of course, prices are always superb!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Purchased couple of hundreds items and after 2 months of waiting I received an email from Canada post saying that the shipment is returning to the sender because they didn't provide my appartment number which I gave them.. and now I'm trying to contact them but I could not find an email so I sent them a message through the app and I received an auto responding message .. unprofessional
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love everything to do with this app. Got my 1st order in early. Great prices, great coupons. I hot free shipping. All items were exactly as described or pictured. I would highly recommend this app to anyone."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is a great outlet for me. Shein allows me to purchase clothes that are fashionable. They are great designs at great prices. I can't tell you how much I have purchased but I have had very few poor experiences. I like the return policy which seems to be easy to use. Thank you Shein for keeping me looking great.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great quality products. Prices are reasonable. Packaging is standard. Delivery was hassle-free. The lead time of delivery is fast. Highly recommended. The app on the otherhand is user friendly, always updated and no issues so far."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've never been disappointed with their service or their items . Everything is on time and in good condition. I highly recommend that people should try shopping through Shein. Online shopping is scary ,but Shein is most trustworthy to deliver your goods in ship shape without any hassle."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"absolutely love this app, I know it's controversy but I literally cannot afford anything else, I've saved hundreds. quality of clothing is debatable but u get fair quality, please look at descriptions and use the measurements, look at honest reviews, and look at product amount, too many people don't do this and end up unhappy. shirts are usually thin and see through and non jean pants are such a strange material. shipping is faster than stated eta. love this app!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love shopping on Shein (she-in). It is a great and affordable shopping app. I would say the most important thing would be to know your measurements or take them before shopping on here, and to also read all reviews looking at user pics to be sure before you make your purchase. Some things take longer than others so be patient."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Despite all the varieties of fashion items. It's not really worth it. At the end the quality isn't comparable to European quality. There's always an issue with the sizes and the worst of all, they claim it's free shipping, however, you end up paying half your purchase as taxes to DHL!!!!! In my opinion it's a scam"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have bought a range of products and so far I'm yet to have any issues with any of my purchases. Everything always arrives,it's always been what I've ordered and no item has been the wrong size.I will continue making regular purchases as I'm delighted with the service."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's ok, caters a lot to S M L clothes and only supply ugly shoes in size US11. Since I wrote this review I must say I am really happy with the many options that are offered. They now have a wide variety of bigger sizes and styles in shoes. I now have to hold back myself from purchasing too many. Great job SHEIN. The clothes are awesome and made well."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It's a good business great merchandise but needs a little work on the live feature so that's why I put 3 instead of 5 I missed a bunch of special boxes and timed boxes during the live and I commented about it and they didn't give me any points or coupons or something for the inconvenience but if they do message me I will definitely change my star thank you
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Everything I have recieved has been great quality and I have found the cutest little decorative items for holidays, birthdays and even house items. So glad I gave in and gave shein a chance because I was skeptical at first. I literally have to get on the app and save to my favorites tab everyday."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the Shein app. The clothing, especially dresses, are fabulous, good quality and great value for money. The variety of clothing, jewellery, handbags, home decor, etc, is extensive. The jewellery items are exceptional, they look much more expensive than the price you pay. I would highly recommend this app to anyone."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Once you open an account you can not delete it. I have been trying for days and they will not let me delete my account I can only log out. I've done all the"" steps"" that it takes to delete my account and yet this stupid app says ""all lines are busy try later"" or ""oops something went wrong try later""....check your email and "" click on the link"" yet they send no link..or for further assistance ""click on customer service"" ..and just gives you the run around. Still no answer ...delete my account!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Hit or miss at times with the quality of certain items, but at the prices available it's worth the risk. Always check the reviews and if possible any pictures. Kids clothing in particular is pretty good, loads of designs to choose from too, and always a sale or opportunity for a discount which is much appreciated."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Really easy to use app, so much choice. You need lots of free time to browse everything, but if your looking for specific just use the search bar. Fast delivery and easy returns"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"As a first time shopper I was hoping for a nice experience as I'd heard about this store from neighbors. But I was disappointed and angry that I deleted the app. My experience was what you'd describe as ""what I ordered versus what I got."" When the first round of order came, I could return the items I wasn't satisfied with freely. But then I got a message from them that subsequent returns would cost over $7 to return an item. So I was stuck with the other items that were useless to me, no refund."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am Absolutely OBSESSED with Shein! They have amazing quality nail supplies. They have items for woman, men, children, pets, even household. So many beauty supplies. Its just an AMAZING place to shop. I've used shein for about a year and a half now and order are least twice a week! The prices are awesome. You just cant beat it!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Have ordered pretty large orders three different times. The shopping experience, check out shipping products and returns we're all excellent! The only thing I will suggest for advice is to check the measurements and reviews of each product."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I gave SHEIN a 5 star rate because all of the products they sell are in good qualities, good fabric materials, and the colors as well as the design is fantastic. I will highly recommend this to all the people who wants to experience an amazing products of SHEIN. You can download SHEIN app on your mobile phone and you will find all the different varieties of products that you want and more... Thank you so much SHEIN you never fail to amaze me.😃🥰🤩"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I don't like my stuff split unless I purchase them sperately, I don't like how long my stuff takes to get to me, most times it goes over to 4 weeks before I receive My products, next thing certain clothes that I purchase that should be able to fit me or the person I ordered them for, some are either smaller or bigger than the size it says it suppose to be, I like shopping on the site but they don't even give you gifts like Amazon to show they appreciation for they customers."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My experience with shein has been great and continues to be... its super easy to become a member, earn points & lots of coupons which is awesome for your big orders. Shipping has always been ontime or earlier then expexcted filled with good quality products x"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I saw some reviews so thought I'd check it out. I was very disappointed. I'm not real large but do take a larger size in tops. Nothing in my size 2x and I don't wear clothes that show my breasts or stomach. These are not the kind of casual dress that I would let myself be seen in. If your flashy, like to show skin then most of these styles are right up your alley."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My favourite website ever, it is so addictive! Very nice staff and excellent quality. I bought my graduation dress with 2 matching dresses for my girls and they looked stunning. Wall stickers, head accessories, kids clothes, women and men clothing are all very nice and delivered before the expected day of delivery."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Extremely slow app, I thought the website was bad but this app is the slowest one I've used compared to other shop apps. I love this store but man the app is slow. Developers please optimize performance speed ! It is very important!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Pathetic experience. I ordered shoes which were too large for me about a month ago. The order took more than a week to come and now that i have sent it back for exchange its almost 15 days and they are just sending msgs that it will take another 6-8 days. Highly disappointed as a first time customer. Never shopping with them again👎 Hope i receive my parcel though 🙏
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Nice app and nice products, the app freezes a lot and often kicks me out of the app. It will also make me go all the way back to home screen when I press the back button and make me have to start my search over. Other then that,I love it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, so easy to use and they have lots of variety so cater for everybody, I will be continuing to buy all my items from here, I love how all the measurements are given when you click on a size so I can confirm they should fit before ordering, I always use the wishlist then when I am ready to order I just select which items to add, everything has arrived well packaged and the tracking is brilliant, also receive text message on morning of delivery"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Most stuff I have order I have been satisfied with how they deal with the processing of item's I order & how quick they do tend to turn up. The app is so easy to use & I love the fact they give u the chance to win free item's & u can earn point's for money off. Don't know other companies that do this
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app works beautifully, I can browse through items, add to cart and purchase, and review with no issues. Search can be improved especially image search but overall, nothing to complain about."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Best app ever. Quality product for affordable price but I'll be very happy if there are more hair products like the Cantu product, edge controls, hair extensions,oils , conditioner and gels also skin care products like facial cleanser, oils, moisturizer, deodorant and so on. Thanks 😘 lots love from sierra Leone. I really wish you will consider my opinion. Thanks again."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Shein is a great app. It lets you know when your going to get a delivery. So easy to order and payment. The close are anmzing but sometimes they don't fit right or the don't look good on you. So easy to return. Sorry I forgot to but. You get points to
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I bought clothes from Shein for last couple of years. Each time the item was described as it is and the material was very good quality. Sizing was to the point. One time i had to return the dress because the style was not suiting me, they provided excellent customer service very fast and i got refunded within 2 days . I am very glad and satisfied with Shein."

Large selection of high quality plus size clothes , i can find an outfit with accesories for any event , special occasion , work, the club, or laying around the house the prices cant be beat ...

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Have had to use the returns process once for some shoes, (a bit small on me), fast service and although delivery takes a while, everything me and hubby have ordered has been spot on. We will be continuing to use Shein for our pretty clothes fix. The discounts and check in procedure are great too!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Selection is very good, sizing is sometimes a little off. I ordered a dress for a size 41 inch bust that is way too small. But the shoes fit great and the order arrived a day early. Iverall great experience."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shopping has been great. They have great sales. We all could use good clothes with good fashion. It's great to look good and feel good on what we put on. Sexy, comfortable, casual or just basic frumpy outfits. I could spend hours just by looking at outfits."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Had some really nice clothes, a few bits have been hit and miss. Returns have been easy (not free). Overall customer service has been great and always get a professional service from them."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is very user friendly. I just love the Runway Show and earning points! The clothes are very stylish, affordable and the quality is great for the money. Whether it is clothing or decor, you will love using and buying SHEIN."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,A Genuine trustworthy site that sells pretty much everything I currently have in my wardrobe. I would recommend it as long as you don't mind paying postage and waiting quite some time for the order but it is worth it they literally sell anything. I have never had any problems with any of my orders so far.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like the app and the deals. I have to restrain myself from purchasing something every other day because they send you deals multiple times a day. I hate that they ask you for your measurements but don't match your size under ""recommendations"" tab. So, you have to know your size based on measurements and match your measurements with the measurements of their size. I'm a large and ""their"" large isn't a bad fit but I'm learning that I could go into ""their"" version of a medium and still have room."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's a great app for ordering inexpensive clothes! They all come in one bag within about 2 weeks and only $3.99 shipping for the whole order. (Unless you go over a certain amount and shipping is free) Great app!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Its the worst experience ever, do not download this app,they are showing something else and providing you with the cheap quality and the customer service policy is also not good. Its takes a hell lot of time to connect and even the delivery takes a lot of time to process. Better to shop from other app!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I love Shein! I bought my entire vacation wardrobe from this app and most of the sizes were spot on! Some were a little big but I'm really thin with minimal curves (I have a few😜) My biggest complaint is the amount of notifications. Waaaay too many
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app's advertising the difference between the different choices, of what you can select, which will be very helpful , to those who are looking for a particular app needed to be opened. Thank you."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love love love shein! I never buy myself clothes bc I'm a mom of 3 and get super mom guilt. So I'm stuck wearing the same 3 pairs of pants and 5 shirts forever. Now I can buy clothes that make me feel good about myself and not feel bad because their prices are amazing. Quality is good. Have not been disappointed yet. The app is fun and there are tons of ways to earn points to put towards purchases.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Personally I really enjoy Shein. I've had great luck with fit. With sizing, with price. Shipping is fairly quick and I've never had an issue with missing product."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love this app I love the clothes and designs but I have to big problems with it, if the clothing has any type of decal it will most definitely come off, and the thing where it says win a prize of 100$ is ridiculous, I did it then I sent it to freinds but then it said 99.5 complete then it said 99.27 complete, what am I supposed to do with that, I know its automated to do the same thing every time but it's just stupid."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app! Perfect for anyone who has there own style.An app for anyone to use and usefull and reasonabl things for ur closet or much more! I love this app not one thing had gone rong with my experience. Everything good quality and great style I've been using this app for quite a long time and it's perfect not many peole know about it so a sended it to my friends and the loved it!shien is my favorite shop. I have got some things take a little while but sometimes come before you know it!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Happy with most of the products I purchase. Just bought a karaoke microphone that didn't work but it's not worth sending back if I have to pay the postage. Chucked in the Bin and bought one somewhere else.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,On the app you can find any clothes for any aesthetic/style i love it cuz you get coupons as soon as you regisrate in and there is literally everything even jewellery and stuf for home! Everything came in the right size and it fits so good!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Easy to navigate and search for specific items. Also great variety of items. Love Shein, literally spend hours on this app, awesome selection, better than what's available at the stores"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I thought that the items are similar to Wish products, but is nothing to do with it. SHEIN was much, much better than I expected. Fast delivery. Quality and price amazing. Very happy with my purchase. Very recommended."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So many beautiful clothes and accessories at a reasonable price. And lots of discount opportunities.Just Amazing. Delivery is very fast even to places that's usually hard to deliver like Maldives. I am very tall and it's really hard to buy suitable clothes and shoes for me but thanks to this wonderful company and app, I have managed to buy so many clothes that fit perfectly. There are no complaints but I do hope that you can increase the variety of items we can buy such at baby toys and make-up."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I bought 4 swimsuits because I couldn't make up my mind. They are all so cute and when i received them i was even happier. There mada very nicely. I did however bought a dress shirt for work and all though it was super cute the quality was not so good but i will wear it and hope after i wash it it will still be in tact. The reason I still gave 5 stars is because the prices are amazing and really u cnt complain for what ur paying. Thank you Shein!❤
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"delivering takes longer than I would like, but all the clothes are amazing quality and always fit perfectly. they are not limited to clothes though, they also have typical house items, phone cases, and so much more. I would highly recommend!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My first time on this app and I made my first order it was about $120 then I got the email saying that it was successful and nothing else was charge but as I checked my bank account $55 was deducted so a total of $175... so I want to know what the hell did I get charged for!😠 there is no notification on this! Please fix it and I want my stolen money back.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein has quality clothing and excellent prices. Two things to improve: the cute blazers, dresses, suits, etc. available for the smaller women, please have the same or similar for the curve plus women. 2. If you are advertising a pant suit, the pants are advertised, please advertise the blazer right there so the buyer can purchase it as well. Then the customer wouldn't have to search the site in order to find the match."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The items I have had have been great. Good value for money. Delivery isn't too long either. They also do fashionable clothes for the larger lady which is great. I would highly recommend SHEIN fashion shopping to all my friends.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Love the app layout, user friendliness, the options available, after purchase accessibility. Really good app and products however, the courier company used being Buffallo Logistics is a let down quite often and their service is poor when you try to resolve an issue with them, it us unfortunate that I will not be purchasing from Shein any longer as a result."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's all really good and I love this app, but this time I had ordered clothes 2 months back and haven't recieved yet. I've already paid the amount too. Now the lockdown has also ended. Please deliver the clothes soon.. I've given 5 star thinking that I would not be disappointed this time too. Waiting for your response I hope you keep this up SHEIN.♥️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The prices are reasonable and items of good quality but the major challenge is that I've been trying to add my mastercard to my account for nearly two weeks now and it's saying I should use another form of payment. I've asked another person who already used her mastercard to purchase items from shein but its giving her tha same challenge. Update I was advised that I should create a PayPal account and add my card there. It worked and was able to do my shopping. Figured that was for security.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The worst shopping app ever. Shein is a scamming brand. I had ordered some dresses long ago. They all are still in transit and upon asking for refund I got automated lame replies. They have pathetic customer service and definitely I ain't gonna shop with em again. Don't use this app I would strongly recommend that not even visit the website.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great this is the app that everyone is getting stuff from and you don't wanna click on it but as soon as you do your hooked I purchased around 5 things for around 50$ dollars and after the quality of the clothes my second order was 12 times at around 120$ I would recommend a size up then normal but otherwise my fave clothing app. I'm plus sized and it's been awhile since clothes have truly fit.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Brilliant, I shop on this app regular for some little bargains, you don't always get super amazing quality but if you check the reviews and photos posted by other shoppers this really helps you work out whether it's a bargain and worth buying, I have got so many amazing things for a feactuion of what it would cost else where !"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Nice clothes at a good price. Returns are easy and quick as are refunds when needed. Great service. Could probably do with more filters on the clothes choices though to narrow down searches a bit. Lots of choice.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm new so not sure yet but so far it's good. I especially like the size calculator: age, height, weight and body size etc. Also like the prices. Delivery could be quicker but don't know how far goods are coming from"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,So far so good. Prices are great. Shipping time and dates are pretty spot on also. Just wish the points were different and not converted to cents so it takes even longer to earn an save.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Best prices best customer service. They forgot to send one of my items. I got it one day later without even having to send them an email. They had noticed it themselves and just went ahead and mailed it. Totally awesome
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love shein. It's my new addiction. Some clothes are cheaply made and others are really good. Most with thick good material but some have flaws like slightly slanted buttons, or shorts sown weird. But overall it's good for the price. I do recommend shein"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It is not a bad cite. I have ordered a lot from bedding to just accessories but, I have had a lot of issues with packages being delivered with a bunch of missing items. I have also heard that the people making the clothes are being abused/overworked."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I order 10 items on 20th January which was divided in two packages. I received second package but first package hasn't been delivered after 36 days also and there is no customer support, first of all its really difficult to raise a issue in shein. And now when finally customer care executive spoke to me. He says you can't get these items, apply for refund. I've been waiting for those items and now you tell me you can't get it. This is how you treat your customers. Pathetic!! Really disappointed"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,95% of the time I have an exceptional experience with Shein. The delivery is always within 2 weeks and the update is accurate. I love the reviews on products that assist with sizing and quality.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Products are good, review system is helpful, delivery is fast, but no philippines or malaysia to select for country. The region is confusing. Asking me to choose the correct region but no option for my country. They have like 20 options available."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I really like a lot of the clothes they have, but after 4xl all of the clothes look like old lady clothes. One of the biggest issues as a young plus size person is finding clothes that fit your age, I don't want to dress in loose-fitting floral cold shoulders all the time. I wish they would expand their size ranges more."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Always a good experience. The reviews on each product are usually accurate and help with sizing/quality of the garments. Most of my wardrobe is Shein items. The returns process is super easy and money is returned to your bank pretty swiftly.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is Amazing! The prices are low, they have a Huge variety of things, ypu cam earn points for things, shipping doesn't take long at all, plus on top of their already low prices you get coupons to, can even get free shipping, and the app is easy to use. Shein is just all around GREAT!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app, safe and easy to use. Clear images for apparel and the likes, and user friendly shopping bag+wish list. Clear notation on ordering and what to expect financially+delivery once order is successfully made. Delivery takes +-2 weeks which is fair enough"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have 2 say I've had way more hits than misses. Always check the reviews & always check ur sizing b4 u put it in ur bag. i would absolutely <3 shein 2 let us build a closet 4 our clothes. The boards r fine til u buy the item & use the already purchased feature, poof ur item is gone. I buy a lot & have 2 delete stuff ive bought bc i 4get & buy it again. So ya, being able 2 build ur own closet would make many customers happy (well, me anyway). a dressing room would be great 2! Developers, please"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I'm surprised with how user friendly and dynamic as well as fluid the app is. The online store is a hassle and a hoff to navigate but the app really simplifies searches with great response time. I've been using it more than the store on desktop but perhaps it's a personal reference. Otherwise a very well architecturally designed app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Reason im giving it 2 stars is becayse they will SPAM you allll day. Notification after Notification. I know i can turn it off but i shouldnt have to do thag cuz the app wants to send me the same notifications 15-20 times a day. Its the same price as going to Ross or DDs . I've ordered couple times already, one of my shirts came ripped and the material was cheap"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,OMG I Love Love Love Shein😍❤ You get great quality stuff at super affordable prices. It's like your absolute favorite store having a humongous sale on literally every single item EVERYDAY.!! It's amazing & I can't say enough great things about Shein & their products.. Definitely one of my absolute favorite apps & where I get literally all of my clothes & home appliances and decor. They have everything & their stuff is the best hands-down.

Everything is here, you don't have to look any further when shopping for exquisite items simply one of a kind. It's happiness to be here. I'm totally satisfied and hooked. I'm a SheIn fashionista..🤩😘❤️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is very reasonable with prices, I can literally spend hours looking at everything, the reason it only got 2 stars from me is because after 3 days of giving this app my credit card information, it still won't except it. I'm getting beyond irritated because I'm going on holiday on the 25th and I desperately want the things I should be able to buy......SORT IT OUT !"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein. I've ordered a couple dresses and they were perfect. True to size and material was lovely. I was really shocked at how fast the order came too. I was skeptical at first but I learned with each product to make sure you read the reviews before you buy. So far so good, it's better than I expected."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very good app because you can choose your exact size of cloth. There are sizes in every items which is very important. 👍 but i hope you can make a good packaging because some of my orders arrived with damage. But this app is good compare to other online shop.❤
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Easy to navigate, great products and quality (I was dubious as so cheap!). Having to return some shoes as wrong size but was really simple to do this and have ordered the same in a different size as they will be perfect."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I always kept seeing the ads for Shein pop up on social media. I knew about the company because my teen daughters had ordered from them. I needed an outfit for an event that I was attending and decided to give Shein a try. OMG! I've been hooked every since. I've ordered over $800 worth of stuff in about a month. The shipping was faster than I thought and the quality of the merchandise exceeded my expectations. The packaging was excellent and I couldn't be happier with my purchases. Thank you!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Quality is good, fits well. delivers on time also. I have ordered several items on night dresses and i feel more confident wearing them. I also ordered some bathroom and car accessories and really looks good. This app is easy to use and you find great satisfaction in all orders. Will order again. Thank you shein and more power!👏👏👏😍😍😍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Ya,ya,fast fashion bad....but easy returns , good product descriptions, measurements for sizing and a plus size inventory that you can't find anywhere else. Yeah 👍. Quality meh but I have gotten some very nice pieces. For work it's nice to be able to not have to wear the same thing each week. Thrift the expensive pieces and SheIn can fill in some inexpensive splashes."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Being a plus size person , it was too hard to get dresses easily even basic ones , forget fashionable. I got every fashion dresses that I wish for here. 💙 A little costly but manageable."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I just love SHEIN, great prices for fabulous n trendy clothing. I think I'm addicted! I have not been disappointed at all! The only reason I held back on 5⭐is the shipping....takes a little while to receive my items. I wait in anticipation cause when do get my order..... I shine....w/SHEIN! THX!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The merchandise is great..as long as you read the reviews on each and every one..you aren't suprised at the sizing and etc...love this site..have lost weight recently and this has been the only way I've been able to afford to replace items in my closet that fits me now!!💜
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this, you have to read the product descriptions because the pictures can sometimes be slightly misleading but the products are brilliant and delivery is faster than expected. Returns are hassle free too"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have loved everything I've purchased from SHEIN Fashion. From clothes, shoes and accessories. Anything that didn't fit me properly I returned with ease and credit was returned back to ny wallet quickly so I can repurchase the right size. After figuring out my sizing I no longer have to return items. I have definitely re vamped my wardrobe and my footwear. Very satisfied customer."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is well constructed and is very easy to use, the clothes are good quality and the models advertise the collection professionally. No complaints and compared to other retail apps the price isn't too misleading and usually includes postage with a fast delivery time."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love the styles and items, super cheap and affordable. But I don't have a perfect body for plus or regular even with measurements I can't find anything that is similar and it's a hit or miss."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love the clothes but the sizes are up and down ordered a Large Hoodie had to change it to a medium because it was too big. Ordered 4 Large dresses all too small couldn't return 1 because it was a sale item so I'm now stuck with a dress I can't wear and same happened to me when I bought a bikini in the sale. Surely if its online and you can't return try it on you should be able to return it even if its a sale item.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is a great shopping app as it has measurements that are specific which helps a great deal to choosing your size. However, co-ords should be allowed to have separate sizes for the components of it as to improve the experience and inclusivity they have."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Awesome app. Fast delivery. everything pictured is what u recieve great deals. Even greater sales and clearance 1,000s of new items addedd all the time. Chlothes from kids to teens to adults to men to woman for everyone , soo afordable ive compared prices with amazon who used to be my go to for chlothes and jewlery and shoes n purses but last month or so I've gotten more outfits and shoes in one order under 300 dollars than i have my entire time on amazon in last few years for way way way more $"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Returns are so easy on this. Just select the items and attach the prepaid shipping label. You'll see refunds as soon as two days. I've reached out to customer service for issues and they've gotten in touch withing 9 hours. Even though the quality of the dress isn't top notch the returns are super easy. So I give it 5 stars.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Useless app. Order is taking ages to deliver. Very non user friendly interface, very hard to find tracking and return options. No feedback on Return requests. Look for better options this one has no shine in it"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love it except the policies. The exchange/money back policy is trash. I waited for WEEKS to get my bathing suit last year, I bought a few and since the exchange policy is trash I ended up having to buy more...But the Quality is outstanding and you can't beat the price!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Brilliant easy to use app that is more user friendly than most apps out there. It allows you to search for specific items easily and save onto different boards depending on the item, as you wish."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have made several purchases and every item has arrived almost a week ahead of time, the quality is very good and everything fits perfectly. Being a 5x it is hard to find nice fitting clothes that is also flattering I have shown the app to my friends."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,literally developed my dressing sense because of this app. Things I would love to see in the app is- 1. SHEIN MEMBERSHIP-would love if they have yearly membership so tht we dont hv to pay the delivery every time and quick delivery should be offered in this membership too. just like amazon prime. 2. I would also appreciate if the app has some special offer/coupan/discount card or any surprise for those who have shopped for more than 10k on the app. loýal Shein customers shd be appreciatd.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I had been pleased with the variety of things and great priceranges but I am upset today. Two days ago the there was a significant change in standard shipping cost to my location in Puerto Rico from $3.99 to $14.99, furthermore today I was forced to remove 6 items I needed from my order because apparently now items from other sellers/stores cannot be delivered to my address. This had never happened before and I have placed several orders containing items as such and there was no problem. Fix it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I appreciate the improvement with the selection of products. One dissapointnent is when I ordered my jean jacket and jeans on separate occasions, the odor of the demin was horrible, very strong like some sort of oil product. Washing them on serveral occasions and spraying them to remove the smell did not help much at all. My suggestion is to follow up with what is possibly causing this to happen"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very nice sexy clothes. The fabric is super good. Would highly recommend. Luxury looking clothes for cheap price. Shipping takes very long but worth it once received. I recommend ordering very ahead of time if you plan on using a outfit a specific day.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I set all my settings to male, but all I was shown was dresses. The app wouldn't know this but I am a trans guy so it became rather frustrating and upsetting quickly. Setup seemed kinda crowded otherwise. Maybe it just takes getting used to."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am so thankful to found out about Shein and especially they catered the Philippines too offering cash on delivery. It's a bit hard to find plus size clothes that has your own size here in the Philippines,and the sizing are true to size. The clothes are also good quality for affordable price. It is just, I guess the search engine of this app is not so good."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Just made my first order with you guys... Let me tell you ladies and gentlemen! Quality was one of my biggest worries because of how cheap they clothes were. Turns out though, the quality is bomb! The prices are so cheap it's unbelievable! And EVERYTHING fit amazing! I don't think I'll ever shop anywhere else again! AND I AM SERIOUS! THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST CHOICES YOU OR ANYONE CAN MAKE!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,One of the worst apps and worse experiences. Customer service in this app is helarious! If you have lost a parcel or had a long delay NO ONE will help you! Ignoring all problems refusing to give you compensation for any damage! They choose the worst carriers to deliver your orders! Best to find another site that has honesty and value each customers without ignoring their problems.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've used this site for a few years now and find the products are as described. Fun to pick pieces to work into your wardrobe. Returns are easy, shipping is fast. No complaints. Would recommend."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Everything so far seems positive. Haven't received my items yet. Hoping they fit and the quality is ok. The website is fantastic so much choice its actually mind blowing. Delivery obviously is going to take a few weeks but I don't mind waiting if the goods are all nice. Fingers crossed. Will write a review once I receive my items. I'm a little bit excited. Oh I'm in Perth Australia
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Clothes are super cute. Bathing suits are comfortable and stylish. I did an order with a bathing suit purchase but it was quite a good fit, which was okay, it was still cute, and the refund process was easy and great. Highly recommend if you love cute affordable outfits!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have never had any problems with my orders...they arrive in the time frame specified...the fabrics are true to the photos...and everything has the look that I want unless I made an error in ordering. I love ordering here!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Great options and quality but lacking in availability. Things get sold out quick and either never come back or come back for brief periods of time before sold out again. Very frustrating.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Th price is good, the clothes are good but the shipment method is quite high for some countries, if you are from US or UK you will not have a problem but HOLD ON in the Soith America the shipment is HUUGE, like I basically could pay for 2 clothes with 15$ (shipment price), like please. I hope someday it get lower. Now I'm out of this app. Agg."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,This is a good application for buying clothes nd all but when i am using this app they gives huge numbr of points for daily checkin and in the show contest for uplaoding images .. As day passes they gives very less points for checkin nd no points for uploading pictures this is the worst experience because the items are very expensive and they give vry less point so im uninstalling this app Because now im disappointed with this ..
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Clothes are ok but the app is not so reliable especially in places where internet is not very fast. I mean, i can play tiktok, instagram, Facebook videos fine with the same internet speed yet the photos here don't show all the time. Make a lighter version!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My friend told me about Shein and I went to online to verify and it was real website and the first time I bought my item, I receive my item not even a week. The second time I order my item, not they ship it the next day. And I was so happy about it. And the item look exactly the one you see online. Shein is one of the best website. I recommend it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the clothes. I like how they let you get points daily, and the vouchers. Some clothing items, the material doesn't match the clothing and sometimes the shirt is flimsy and see-through."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing styles and tons of options for women with more curve! That's hard to find! The quality of some of the clothes could be a bit better, but for the prices you are paying it's most definitely worth it! Love Shein!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have had an extremely pleasant experience with the Shein shopping app. All of the products that I've purchased has exceeded my expectations and for remarkable prices. This shopping app is easy to use and customer service is as equally easy to use if any situation arises.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Sometimes your delivery comes faster than the actual given time sometimes it doesn't. I ordered something using express shipping and I received the one of standard shipping way faster than the express shipping. And the express shipping is 12 pounds while the standard shipping is 2. I desperately need it by tomorrow but I don't know what's gonna happen and I'm panicking
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The prices are good depending on what you looking for and the quality of clothes are good fabric. But the shipping just takes 2 weeks which is a little too long, but not bad."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I shop SHEIN frequently for both me and my daughter. I dont just LOVE the products, and the variety of items they offer, I absolutely LOVE the fact that when an item I've been interested in is out of stock they inform me right away and alert me as soon as it's back in stock. So I never miss out."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Fast delivery, consistently good quality for the price. I just wish after everything I've bought I could get something free with all the points I've accumulated thrift PURCHASES. The least they could do is let me get 100% of with my points😐."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is very good, the problem for example is when you choose some shoes to see them and then you want to go back and continue to see them all, instead it sends you to the home screen. And this is for every item that you want to see."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app, the quality of the clothing is exceptional and the prices are affordable, and I usually wait a month for my order to get to me in Cape Town. The only con is the custom fees, they can be really pricey and there's no way for you to know before hand how much it's going to be."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.... WORST APP. I purchased a dress for 1700₹ and since it was not of proper size i returned it. They told me to wait for 8-15days for money back. They never replied me or informed me again. They also removed my orders from history. There customer care no. Is not reachable and it's been more than a month. No clue about the money back.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"You are bombarded with promo's instantly. The instagram add says Shein Curve giving the false advertising that it's specified for plus sizes and the garments being advertised on instagram. But no you have to wade through all the pop ups to get to the main screen then search for the item advertised. The thumb nails are too small and the page is over complicated with all the icons, thumb nails, adverts. Everything."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It is never easy to choose clothing on line. Will it fit? Will the colour suit me? Will I even receive my parcel? Please let me put your mind at ease. SHEIN and another on line supplier is the only way I shop now. I don't order in a hurry. I mull over everything that I love ♡, and go back to add or eliminate. What works for me is colour coding. Every time I order, I choose items that can mix and match. I then get more outfits because I've put thought into it. Great prices. Great delivery."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great selection awesome prices. I have no complaints about the quality of their products either. Bought a bathingsuit last summer and it's holding up geat. The shipping time was extremely long that is the only bad part.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app! I wouldn't have though I'd fine clothes I like and would fit but they do! They have such a good range of clothes and styles. I've never been disappointed with what I've bought, one thing I would say it always check to material as some item are made from a material you wouldn't expect it to be and therefore may not fit how you want it to, having said that I always check so I've never been surprised and unhappy with what I've received. Homeware also has a good range 👍👍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Nice clothes, but the app is slow, and games are scams. Every time I'm close to winning the game, it takes me back to start over even though I have days ahead to complete the game. Every time I go back to the game, it is another issue, like they never go to let me win. I win 2 prices in another app with no issues. I keep saying this is a scam to make you buy items"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I didn't ordered anything from Shein but it is really good,it has nice stuff but there was one problem I didn't knew the zip code ,then I searched on Google and then did all of that but it is not doing cash on delivery right now and I do not have any debit or credit card so I am not able to order anything but if it had cash on delivery during quarantine or else I would rate it 5 🌠 but overall it's good!!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Quick delivery and products at incredibly affordable prices! Only thing I would like be able to suggest would be to be able to apply more than one coupon per order but w the low prices, I guess I shouldn't complain."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've only ordered once but everything from the order fit perfectly and my package got to me in a timely manner surprisingly because this was when Covid was slowing down mail. The app always works fine and I love the deals that it offers.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I'm new on here and made a few mistakes. I ended up getting on a chat with shein and they fixed my issues no problem. I love the new customer coupons as I'm shopping for my first big trip so I'm a very happy customer!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Once you start shopping from shein. You won't go anywhere else specially for the curvy girls. I having a curvy body didn't had much choices on online shopping but shein gave me a new life. The curve section is fully loaded with varieties of options. The only thing I want to suggest them is if they could use the quality a bit lighter cause their clothes are really very warm. That's it. But I love you shein for making my life beautiful. ❤
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love shein. Haven't had any issues with quality, not every piece of clothing has fit but that's only been 1 in every bulk order and I'm aware of the risk and accept it. Usually it's because I've miss judged the sizing. Appart from that the prices are great and delivery time is reasonable."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this site. Clothes are very reasonably priced and great to wear. I've bought items from all the departments...for me (plus size), for my daughter (women's wear), my hubby and eldest son (menswear), my 9year old twins (kids) and even for our lovely dog. Fabulous! I often get compliments for items and people are shocked at the price."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"You get what you pay for so it's very convenient to know and expense for. Reviews is where it's at, hit or miss, don't get attached to the clothing because it may not fit like you'd like but, you can always alter. LOTS OF SALES ALL THE TIME!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,First time ordering from this App and I won't order anything else. Worst experience ever. Sizes are not adequately displayed. It says on the App that items have been delivered in actuality they haven't been. Thought I would have a better experience. I give it a thumbs down.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Their shipping and packaging is always so impressive and delivery time is usually within 2 weeks. Almost always return is free. Never been disappointed so far. It's my all time favorite shopping app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a really good app, you want to buy everything possible. They give you money to waste of their own and a lot of promotion and cupons. There are also a lot of reviews on the items and they give you the dimensions of what you want to but. Depending on how much money you waste you also receive a free gift."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The app is chaos and completely ineffective. The products are garbage and often arrive defective. Returns are very difficult. Every customer service response takes 24 hours. The incessant emails ads are a nightmare that are almost impossible to remove.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"On the whole it's a good app with affordable prices & a good range of products. One issue I have had recently, I bought four lots of bedding on Dec 7th & still not arrived, Royal mail tracking status last updated on 19th December. Frustrated with robot response on helpline I figured out to take a ticket & raise query for 24hr response. Shein agreed to resend 3 of my items & credited account, fourth out of stock. Repurchase of 4th cost much more cos vouchers/sale/shipping not applicable bummer😓"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I ordered 2 dresses and paid £9 for express shipping so they would be here for an event. Out of the 2, one was completely the wrong dress and is cheaper on the site than what I paid for the one I wanted. So disappointed although what I did receive were very nice dresses and made to a good standard for the price. Also, I emailed to report this and was told I'd have a response in 24 hours and it's been over 48 hours and no response yet"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love Shein & the app feeds not only my shopping needs but my creativity. I've been able to explore with new looks for both me & my home through the convenience of the app & the incredible prices! They even make the returns easy!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My order no. ZPL103742 I didn't get my refund yet even after returning the product. Your app is showing that the refund is proceeded but the amount haven't reflected in my bank account yet. Are u really taking forever to refund my money. You have worst customer service and I'm never ever gonna buy from your app again. And I recommend to u all also not to shop from this app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app. The shopping experince has been lovely as well!!! Once you navigate thru the app a couple of times its easy to learn. And no ads which is wonderful as well. So much to choose from! Something for everyone!!! Love love love!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Shein could take a page out of Namshi's book. I used to love Shein so much, but it feels like the quality has dropped so much as of late. I prefer getting accessories from Shein because of the great deals, but they take forever to get delivered. I've ordered plenty and it's really surprising if ever it comes before two weeks. My last order has been three weeks pending now whereas Namshi comes in two days."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is a great place to find affordable clothing and it also has other thing like school supplies, accessories, etc. I also think their return system is good and they don't take long to cancel your order, if needed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've ordered twice from SheIn. Both times I have been very pleased. Orders come quickly, carefully packaged. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because the sizes run small and I wish they offered even larger sizes. Otherwise, I'm very happy! I absolutely adore that that I can get unique clothes and jewelry for everyone in my family!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A Little Buggy, The Savings Are Worth It. Have purchased quite a few things, have not had to return a single item. Everything arrives on time if not early. The quality is great, the fabrics are way more luxurious than you might imagine. What are you waiting for? Start shopping!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great prices Massive range of clothing plus more fo the home. Would definitely recommend I have bought loads of clothing for me and my family, and they have been good quality. Some item's aren't the best made but it doesn't matter if you don't like it you can send it back for free."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I had previously left a review of 2 starts boy was I wrong to do that they should get 0 stars so many issues with my account and they say you can contact support but it's not accepting my email finally I find a way to contact them and it's all bots I didn't get an answer to my problems so I try contacting a real person it says leave a ticket and it takes you through so may steps that after trying to deal with it all day you just give up
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,My daughter and I always had trouble finding the clothing style she wants and same as me. Then she recommended me SHEIN and we have loved it since! The clothing were cheap and good. The shipping was very fast as well! There's lots of trendy clothes so I highly recommend. ♡
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,As of now i'm S3 I super love it. The shipping is very predictable unlike other online shopping don't know when the arrival is. Super affordable I even save points for me to use if I wanna buy my add to cart items. This is my relieving app when I'm stress I just add it and I got money I will buy it. The clothes it's like you buy it expensive because they look so classy and branded. Thank you
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Customer service is horrible. Something as simple as deleting my account is made complicated with crooked Shein. And their clothes rarely look like what you see on the model. If you live where I live it takes a month or longer to receive package. I used 2-4 day delivery on a package that has been missing for 7 months. Sure they gave me a refund but they will never take responsibility for tracking lost packages. Nope. That's your responsibility even though they are the shipper.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely love love shopping on Shein!! Everything that I buy is from Shein I used to shop a lot at fashion Nova but then I found the same jeans and shirts at Shein for way cheaper.. the same material you have to definitely read the description of the shirts, jeans etc.. I always do and I never am disappointed when I receive my packages! I order for my 9 month old daughter , 16 yr old daughter ,17-year-old son,as well as my husband!!! Not to mention even our dogs❤️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The products are very affordable you are able to get points to get free stuff and rewards and most of the products aren't bad quality but I would also like to say you only get what you pay for so I wouldn't expect the best quality but it may surprise of how good it is, but other then that I would recommend this app.😁👍"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Their site is easy to navigate, loads of items, cheap prices BUT items aren't cheap in quality. My items came a week earlier then expected and out of 7 items only 1 was slightly bigger, but otherwise people's comments are true and correct about the products."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've only ordered 1 outfit thus far. What I got was good quality for the $. I wish they had more styles of tops. Most are very low cut, weird giant sleeves, or cami straps. If like to see more shapely office type styles. Other than that, items seen very nice. I'll continue using them."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This was my first experiance with Shein my daughter and granddaughters use it all the time .The app is so easy to use plus the clothes are so easy to view and such a wide choice and the reviews are really helpful .When my clothes come i was pleased with all of them and i love the bags they come in .I waited just about 10 days which was'nt bad . I have to say i am totally hooked now and i have already sent my second order off xx
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Its got a very wide selection of garments , accessories and goods at reasonable pricing. There is something fab for every taste , age and occasion. It takes some time to arrive and the quality though usually good can sometimes be awful. You can't return many items ."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is amazing full stop. This app is a life saver, it gets you whatever you want and the shipping doesn't take long either and it's always secure in packaging, so if your ordering any fagile, things they won't break! This is my favourite shopping app!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I'm new to Shein and I can say I love their variety of clothes quiet a lot so far but it isn't that easy to navigate if I want to return clothes a certain way despite the options put for me. I can't select my nearby location to help me return them and I think the user interface needs a little bit more work to simplify everything
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great experience!!! Awesome items. Based on reviews and customers pictures can make buying decision and be happy once items are received. Shipping was very timely. I get notifications on great deals and you can find anything you can dream of 😊 in Shein.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I havent got any bad items, great quality, recommend making more xs clothing for petite people, apart from that everything is great. Would appreciate more alternative clothes too, all the ones i have purchased are great."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've had nothing but amazing products from Shein. I'll admit I was a little hesitant at first but ordered less then $50 worth of clothing just to see what it was about & let's just say I was amazed to the point I'm waiting on several more orders now to arrive. Always here on or before date given & I don't go shopping in the malls much anymore. Thank You Shein!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"All my experiences with Shein have been good so far. The quality is good and sometimes I am surprised with a very quick delivery, when the items are on stock at the Local Facility in the UK. Would recommend :) Try it and you'll become addicted to Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Was hesitant about ordering from here at first but everything I've bought has been decent quality. Delivery is fast and I'm kept informed about where it is. One order I cancelled as I'd accidentally put 2 of the same item in the basket and it was refunded the same day! Great service.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I don't normally write reviews, but I was surprised by the customer service. My package was delivered to the wrong address, the carrier's fault not Shein, and they gave me a refund without issue! It took a few days for the investigation on the package to process and I honestly expected to be out a few hundred dollars, so I was very glad when I actually got a refund. Will definitely continue to shop here!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I made an order on the 27th August and still haven't received my package. I even had to pay additional customs tax but my order hasn't even moved since. It still says ""Tax Paid"" and is showing no signs of ever changing. I can't even seek a refund because my order has already been shipped, so I'm stuck waiting for a package that I'm not even sure will arrive anymore. I regret the day I made a purchase here and wouldn't wish my experience upon anyone."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Customer service is excellent. Delivery was quite fast. It only took a few days to arrive. The merchandise is so amazing and is really of excellent quality. All items fit so well, it makes a change that if I order something I never have to worry about if it will fit me or not. I am so pleased that I found Shein. The choice of merchandise is so amazing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Excellent....easy navigation... Prices are super affordable..so you can add to your wardrobe constantly and they have different styles of fashion for the entire family.. and the coupons are excellent....
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I started shopping with shein just about two months ago and their things are really nice and the quality too is very good. They are truthful with the discounts and sales and haven't had any issue with the deliveries. I will recommend them to anyone.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I just signed up, but I'm really impressed with everything so far. Very pleased with the many variations of styles, colors, and sizes ""true to your size"" for the perfect fit. Shein gives detailed measurements of every piece to insure this. I would also like to mention how awesome the deals are.. So now, with all that said the only thing left to decide is if the quality stands true as well."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I ordered two dresses. They were way too small. Then I measured and ordered two different ones. They were way too big. Then I ordered smaller sizes of same dresses. One is too tight and one is about 2 feet to long. Drags in the ground. I have lost money through all this. Now I have to pay someone to cut and hem the one dress. Ridiculous.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,My shipment always come early which is a plus the size is accurate for me (I wear size small) There is a few things I ordered that looked cheap but for the most part everything always looks as it does in the picture. Prices are very reasonable And they have an option to use after pay.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Never received my things or a refund after paying over $50 on stuff. Contacted FedEx and was told they were ordered by the sender to DESTROY my package. I attempted to contact Shein, but when I visited their 'contact us' page I was met with a '404 page not found' message. Did some googling and found an email I've been unsuccessful in getting a reply from. Overall I do not recommend. If you value your money like I do, take it elsewhere!!"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's been amazing using this app. Mind-blowing collection and amazing services. Inspite of that, I've deducted one star because I find commodities running out of stock soon and no quick restoration is initiated which i think is a big lacking for such an amazing website like Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really love shein,, their products are all good, pretty and it's really a good quality when it comes to their clothes I really really like it very much. I recommend it for everyone to try shopping on shein,, I can guarantee you that it is worth your money with every purchase you will make💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜 Many of their items is always on sale and you can also claim points with your everyday check in so you can use it when you order and you can get your big discount by using it😊"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Love the availability of the weird clothes designs and trends at great prices... And the addition of home accessories is a great touch!!! Nice application and functionality. However reducing delivery time from 3 weeks to maybe 1 week would be nice
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"For the price being decently affordable its the way to go. Honestly it's a good 80% chance of getting exactly what you want and the other 20% being maybe made a little cheaper then expected. But honestly it's my go to for festivals and also just bargain shopping. Good range on all genders, home product, animal product and more. Pretty happy with everything I've recieved."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The Shein app is very easy to use, each item page features many details and photos to help with sizing information and includes many helpful reviews and photos and also product suggestions. I love browsing the items and the favorite list is also very helpful and easy to use. I would definitely recommend!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"4/5 stars. I gave this rating becuase nothing is perfect and there is always room for improvement but SHEIN is pretty close. This app has great deals and the clothes are in style and not to mention, gorgeous! SHEIN is definitely worth your time. Thank you SHEIN!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"App is ok. Another wish like platform that you have to be careful what you buy. Items often are not matching images especially from 3rd party groups. Which also can't return items to. Get charged for returns after your 1st, $7.99 there after. Notifications are insane will get numerous throughout the day."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"As a person who likes to save money for important stuff this app really let's you do that instead of buying one pair 50€ pants in the store on here I was able to buy 3 and they all we're great!!! Everyday I get a coupon and a free spin where I can get even more coupons, I'm able to collect points which are literally money 100=1€ which is frickin amazing!! Not only that also little games where I was able to win money even tho I wasn't able to win the big price I was able to save up! 10/10"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love everything about it! The ease of shopping and purchasing. Payment plan if needed/wanted. Fast shipping and clothes aren't too bad.. I'll be shopping more often and using the app!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great prices and selection. Reviews aren't always accurate because people are hoping for likes, but you can find some great deals on home goods and fast fashion if you read the descriptions carefully."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I've only ordered from shein once. The works good. The tracking was a pretty off but thats pretty normal. One of the things I ordered was very different from what it showed on the model.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Please try to update the customer time to time. Delivery needs more and more improvement.It's been 13 days I've ordered some clothes. Still it is not shipped yet. I'm a first time buyer.So it is not a great experience for me.Infact it's a terrible experience. At first i ordered some clothes which got canceled due to some shipping problem. However i got my refund because i paid that through debit card. Again i ordered some clothes. Which is still in processing. You guys need a lot of improvement
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So far my experience with Shein has been great! For the price, the fit and quality have been perfect for me! I usually rely on reviews & photos before ordering. They offer really unique earrings I receive compliments on whenever worn! Highly recommend!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I had recently purchased clothes from shein in promotional offers and few of the tops are not of good quality and too loose and I am unable to place return request for that order.. When I called customer service he directly told me that cannot take returns and was rude on call... This was the worst ever experience I had with shein. I am never going to shop from shein again. I have done the total shopping of Rs 11000 and the response was not positive.There is no return for items in offers.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this store!! For clothes, shoes, accessories, etc this is the only place I shop now. Just read the reviews and pay attention to not only your own measurements but the measurements of each clothing piece. Leave your purchase reviews too, as this helps with others' shopping experience (plus you'll accumulate points that can be used like cash off towards your future purchases! Happy SheIn shopping!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app has everything from clothes, to undergarments, nightwear, shoes, bags, and they have affordable prices as well 😊 They do have a line where the prices are pretty high, but it's still a good app to use if you want to find cute/sexy/elegant clothes to use."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I like the Shein app. I can check order status quickly and see what is new. It's easy to use. Customer service was very helpful and resolved issues quickly with an order that did not arrive. Very satisfied with the service.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Wow I always though Shein was one of those cheap scam websites like DressLilly but since doing some reserch and using this app I can tell you they are definitly legit. There are so many ways to earn points to get money off alredy low priced clothing and there is so much choice. I think this will be my main go to for clothing now. :) the only downside is that as they are based overseas shipping takes a while (compared to next day like we're used to with Amazon lol) but the pros outweigh that con.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shein has helped me to stop stressing myself going to the mail everytime i need to buy clothes. All I do is order at the comfort of my home. Which makes life easy, also their clothes are fashionable and their app is very easy to use. I recommend Shein to all those that don't like going to mails to fit clothes and those with busy schedule."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love Shein. They have literally almost everything you could think of and great prices. Tried so many of their products and clothes and i keep most of them but things i order in multiple sizes or try on and dont love on my body, are always easily and conveniently returned no hassel. Ever. Seriously Shein is a game changer for my wardrobe. Make sure you check out all their shoes and purses !!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Wide variety of options of clothes with the latest styles. Very reasonable prices. The reviews and images from customers help with choosing sizes. There are always sales specials, free delivery with an easy return policy."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love love Shein!!! At first I was a bit hesitant to order and now I place an order like every week! Lol and the products keep getting better and better. Never am I disappointed. Only problem is that I always spend no less than $100 but you cannot stack coupons so that's the only flaw.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Not bad but the books and things of that nature are VERY small, i ordered 2 books for school and they weren't big enough to write in or keep notes in, it's crazy, and shipping takes absolutely forever, it took at least 2 weeks for my items to get to my house."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Using this app is the best decision i have made easy to use and a lot of item to choice from,great specials, the clothes are of great quality and fit to perfect size. shipping is fast and the packaging is really nice, i have recommended this app to some of my friends. who are now customers.i will be ordering more stuff in the near future. thank you Shein. ways to receive points daily,coupons for discounts,free shipping on sundays, what more can you asked for. anything just search and its there."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Mostly great! Waiting on delivery's from other country's has been frustrating. One order was delivered to another state, not my own. I've reported this, but wasn't contacted. I happened to see the delivery address on the tracking Information. It wasn't mine. The only reply was written to me.... re-order the product, & pay for it again! Does this go against my account?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Bin forced to write this by the notification pop up, actually annoying me at this point. But yeah good app, delivery arrives in about a week unlike other places. Fair decent amount of stuff and most of the stuff is decent quality too."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Haven't brought anything from the app yet, but the clothing looks very stylish with good materials and there's pictures of everyday people of all shapes and sizes trying on the clothing they brought so you can tell what it would look like on yourself if you had that particular body shape. The clothing is quiet affordable too, and features afterpay aswel for the people who are obsessed with using that payment method (like myself 😂). Can't wait to order something from here when I can 🙂"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this shein fashion so happy I found out about this on line clothing store .I have ordered a lot since last summer thier dresses are so cute .their cloths are true to size for me .so much cheaper then anywhere else I have ordered from The quality is good in most items. Must remember they do come from China so will not recive in 7 days usual time for me is 2 to 3 weeks but so worth wait the time Exchanges are so easy also.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shein has been one of the best and a favourite outstanding online shopping to me, and to most people. Their products are good and the shipping process is accurate, but one thing I will like is they should improve the quality of the material they use because some of the material textures are synthetic, thanks I hope something will be done about it, I appreciate your efforts."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I only have a problem with return items, coz it says we have to pay shipping charges while returning but other sites offer us free return options. Other than that Shein offered very affordable and fashionable items which are great for everyone."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So easy to navigate. It us so easy to add to or edit your basket. Daily check-ins earn you points which can be used as extra money off an order. Such an easy shopping app, quality of items is good, delivery times can vary, but tracking your order is so easy too, you are can see process, posted and received information all though the package's step to your door."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I am very confused by their ordering system....and why they divided my order in 2 and led me to believe I needed to pay a lessor amount and got a shock to make another payment. I did contact customer service was not helpful very difficult to get hold off. Plus if you buy big you get hit with Taxes and Courier tax even when it says free shipping. Not happy
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent sizing,prices and quality materials. Especially for plus size/curve ladies like myself. I hope they dont change and make it so its so expensive for items and shipping that Canadians can no longer shop there."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love the clothing, ships quicker then expected. The quality is great and pricing amazing. So happy, I am always on the app looking at new cloths. Some of the styles you cannot buy around here locally."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love that you can put your stuff in the cart &select what you want to buy at the moment! I hate that Amazon doesn't do that you either have to save for later or delete. For this reason alone I'd rather use Shein than Amazon! Excited to see what else Shein does!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great online shop, sizing is pretty accurate for Irish women in my opinion. I am 5'10 and have found the clothing good fit generally and surprisingly good quality for the price. You always get a discount and free postage which is super. If I was to find a fault, I have ordered shoes and boots 5 times, they really are all different sizes (too small generally so order up) overall recommend this app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I like this app specially because of the wide range of variety it provides and i do not hesitate now to order because of its 'pick up from home to return the product' feature. I highly recommend it.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The shipping does take a while, and the quality isn't always the best. I bought a skirt from here before and the zipper broke shortly after. Other than that, the prices and the variety of products is amazing"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Always had great service from shein, love the fact that are affordable, some items may not be quite how they look in the photos but overall I've had a great experience, some clothes are smaller sizing so always pays to get a size up."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have made several orders and was beyond pleased with my purchases! Would recommend this app to everyone! Faster delivery, quality clothes at an affordable price! Can't beat that!!! Shein is awesome!!! I love the makeup i purchased. I am absolutely in love with my sweater and the 3 flare leggings i bought and would buy them again. Couldn't be happier with Shein!! I was offered free membership and found 4 beautiful shirts super cheap. Quality clothes, fast shipping and super affordable!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"SheIn had been a really great app to use, it's a little touchy when filtering but aside from that smooth sailing anything I can't do in there I jump on Google and make changes and it immediately reflects changes through the app"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,So far the app has been easy to use and flows through the pages easily. It's fun shopping online when your not waiting for images to load. Waiting for my first items to come in the mail. Trust an update is coming. 😉
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I received my package earlier than expected, the shorts are thin material but thats fine. However the see through shirt is literally pulled theres threads coming from sleeves and the bottom. I dont want to return it just because i know how much of a hassle its been for everyone else. Oh and also, a lot of people are saying they were hacked, their credit cards have locked and other accounts as well. Not sure how i feel about this app now."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,No complaints. The app is easy to navigate convenient. The clothes have been good quality and true to size. Haven't had any problems with shipping either. Great on line store!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The clothes here are cheap and good quality. They also have other things like jewelry, kitchen tools, mens clothing, kids clothing....all types. Its fast shipping, less than 2 weeks for me. Never had a problem with anything, never had to do any returns because the clothes fit perfect where you dont have to order a size up. Ive ordered off this app 5x already and no complaints so far. Id definately reccomend this app. You also get reward points for checking in everyday. Theres also promo codes."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very enjoyable when shopping online for me forsure. Just wish you had credit or credit cards. And i wish the nail products would get a bit better instead of worst now not all the nails but your burgandy ones are not as shinny. I will keep buying because of the price.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The cart no longer shows what sized you added to your cart and its confusing and needs to be fixed I don't know what size anything is and I have to into the product and save it again so I know for sure and it still doesn't say the sizes. Edit: Even lower rating seeing as everything you add to your board deletes once you close the app
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,My experience with SHEIN has been excellent. I tried TEMU and had a horrible experience. SHEIN is definitely the way to go. The customer service is great and the products have really good quality
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Most everything that I have bought from Shein has been wonderful. Fits great, washes up nice, last for a long time. Always read the description to make sure you're ordering accordingly to size. I'm most cases I do order up a size or two. I'm always happy with my purchases."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have really enjoyed shopping with SHEIN. I have liked all of the items I have purchased from them. All of the clothes have fitted as the should. Liked all of the products I have received from them. The prices are good and reasonable. I will continue to shop with them and enjoy the rewards!! Thank you
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have been using shein for many years now. I haven't faced any issues yet. But the lately when I want to submit any product review with images of the product. It does not let me upload images. I don't know if there is any bug or glitch but I request the team to look into it as people refer to images first then the written review. The products are good for the price they are and I want people to know that. But the app does not let me upload any images.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I love shopping with shein really good prices and super cute and sexy clothes and shoes and bags but really terrible customer service I have been shopping with shein for probably 2 years and and in the last 3 months I've spent almost a 1000 dollars I'm level 3 and supposed to have speedy service among other things well I ordered a order on February 27th and still have yet to receive it and has not updated sense the 4th of March the shipping company doesn't have it and shein said wait
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Was hesitant for a long time to order from here but I am glad I did. I noticed alot of online stores have the same products as shein but way overpriced.. so deff look in the app first! I guarantee you'll find the same products just at a better price with shein.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Bought a pair of leggings just to see if they would be long enough (5'10"") and they were so bought 2 more pairs and a top. Top's sleeves more like 3/4 sleeves but still love it. Easy to navigate around app and purchasing was easy. Would recommend."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is a great app and service (despite the controversy of being a Chinese Sweat shop) for people who aren't able to buy more sustainable and ethically sourced clothing. And orders always usually come within half a month in my own experience. And there are some really cool rewards offered as well during certain times of the year.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Fantastic app and great deals on products. The only negative is the poor notification control. It doesn't allow us to choose what notifications we want and what we don't.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"the categories do not have all the options in the list. had to type it in the search. also the filters are not accurate, alot of items do not appear although I'm selecting the right color or style..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"For the most part, great quality. Always read reviews and filter to determine size. Easy returns and fast shipping and you get points towards your purchases when you review the items from your previous orders. I'm a little addicted TBH... 🙄😬"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have been using Shein for 2 years now, Love the quality of the clothes an true to the sizes, as long as you measure by the chart. Always good deals, sales..Shipping takes 2 weeks at the most, always find that special outfit for the occasion. I love this App.."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE WITH THIS APP!! This store/app is my new favorite place to shop for clothes for myself and I'm about to even check out the kids section which I didn't realize they had at first lol they seriously have wonderful deals and good prices even without talking about the sale price! I am a new member to this app for about a week or week and a half now but I've been on the app every single day no joke! Plenty of cute clothes and I'm sure other cute stuff I can't wait to purchase more!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A wonderful and exceptional experience, where I find exactly what I need in plus size.Looking chic in your outfit all day.The prices are amazing, with discounts available. THIS is the best app for fashion at amazing prices."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"order one pair of jeans on 12 March 2020, waited 2 and half months for my order. When I went to track the item the last information I was given was that it arrived in my country on March 24th, but I hadn't received it. I emailed customer service, only for them to tell me 2 and half months late that they had lost my package. very disappointing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"There is a variety of clothes and they come at a reasonable time, the only thing sometimes the clothes come a bit see-through but that's basically it. I rlly like to shop of shien personally because you can littally get anything on it!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Thank you, SHEIN, for coming to my life! It's such a pleasure to know you. SHEIN has everything I have dreamed of, from Goth outfits, otaku items, to mini short skirts and sexy lingerie, which I can never find in local stores, especially for my size. You have everything! It's only a month since I had the first order, but your service hasn't disappointed me a bit. Delivery was always on time. Prices and discounts are lovely, very much reasonable. Love!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love Shein. I love that the customers get to define the items to each other because there's no agenda 🖤 I have love almost everything I've looked into and gotten!!! Five stars!!! The only thing that could be improved would be to have shoe sizes listed vs inches!!! 😳 I never measure!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Been using Shein for over a year now !! I can't fault them with anything. I would be lost if it wasn't for this site. Amazing Quality clothes at Such cheap prices but the standard is still really high. I've ordered Clothes, Make up, Jewellery. All Amazing. Delivery is standard some times faster than other times but apart from that. The best site i know of. Customer services is really good also."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein ❤️ , excellent quality and extremely cheap and very reliable service. My only complaint is the European sizes are a lot smaller than UK, had to go up a size and the shoes are shockingly small even though I went up a size."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Easy to used. Had been using for half year and very satisfied of the fast services from each stores. Can be considered as a reliable shopping apps. Keep on improving and upgrading.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app runs smoothly, products are of good quality. They have been delivered to me in Ireland in 20 days or less. Huge discounts, very trendy fashionable clothing, always read reviews before buying to be sure of the size etc."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Amazing clothes in all different styles and colours and shapes. Not only does it give you the measurements of the item but also the measurements of the model. Delivery is quick and quality is excellent.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Am very pleased with their quick return policy and their products are very nice. I hv returned some shoes cos the size are a bit confusing. Apart from that, they are very ligit.....the app is well explained...u can track your order on the app....u can see your previous orders. They shld plz extend the span of the previous orders cos sometimes we want to go back to it and re order."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The majority of the time the clothing and prices are amazing. Reading reviews and checking your size if very important. Some items will be hit or miss, but for the price it is worth it!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I like variety of items that can be purchased. Everything purchased have been packaged well. Perfectly fit. Uniquely designed. I would like to get purchases quicker. I send order in and send other orders once purchases arrive.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is so easy to use and the recommendations are always on point and showing me what I would like. So many clothes at a cheap price, but sometimes the app is kinda slow and doesn't boot up. Other than hat though, I love this app and I will definitely be buying more from Shein"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've ordered twice from Shein, and have been very pleased both times. I'll definitely be ordering again. The app is easy to use, the items are reasonably priced, and the shipping only takes about a week - week and a half to get in."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Don't know whats wrong with the app. I've been unable to check in the last couple of days due to a ""server error"". Also I cannot access the points I already had. Now it shows 0 !!! I hope it gets fixed pretty soon..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It rendered a very bad experience on my first order itself. I was unable to recieve my order because of lack of prior information of the delivery. Then i requested re delivery of the order multiple times, after five days, they cancelled my order. Ha."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I'm new to Shein. I've only placed one order thus far. I'm waiting for my package to arrive. I'm exceptionally excited! I have a friend whom orders from Shein often and she always receives items with great quality and fast shipping so I'm expecting the same to be true with my order. I already have my cart filled up again and almost ready to place my second order. 🙂❤
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Clothing is nice well made, and delivery was on time or faster than stated even during the Christmas season but sizing is somewhat difficult to judge my daughter is a 16 s we used the sizing chart which covers 16-18 tops and bottoms = 3x however the bottom was slightly too large but tops were perfect as she is heavier in the bust area. Overall I am so pleased with Shein and will continue to make purchases with them....."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great shopping platform, the reviews section let's you see photos of real people wearing the clothes so you get a good idea of cut, fit and fabric. Most of my wardrobe is from here now, and if I need to return something the process is super easy. Definitely recommend!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Brilliant!! Quality and items themselves are exactly like they are described. Sizing is on point aswell. Always ensure measure yourself to get the right size and you will have no problems:) fast delivery and packaging is also really well done.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Cheap clothing and home items. Most are great quality, plus sizes are great, but tops can be slightly too short for my liking (but that's just my preference) I'd say the only downside to shopping on this app is the delivery time. It can take a week or 2 to arrive, but other than that, it's great."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I haven't really had any issues, big thing is always checking the ratings before buying and sometimes the tracking system isn't great but in that situation you can reach out to their teams and they're usually happy to help"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The site is fun but hard to navigate because I've gotten things that run way too big & it's hard to find customer service help on there. I do what the app says about confirming delivery & I still get messages sayin I need to confirm delivery.... it gets tedious. This site could be more user friendly. It almost makes me not wanna shop on here. It feels like a hassle for a return
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ordered a dress my daughter wanted for her homecoming dance on September 11th, paid the extra for express shipping and here it is the 23rd and the dress has been stuck in Memphis since the 16th. Can't even find a number to call to cancel the order. You have to wait for item to arrive then use a label from them to return items once the status says shipped."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Seriously the best deals on clothes with good quality. I used to shop boutiques until I found shein. They literally have everything. Shipping is slow but they are getting allot better and tracking is very good and always updates.never had any issues.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shopping done right! Finally a One Stop Shop that has it all. Good Taste, Wide Variety/Sizes and Affordable Prices. The clothes are as advertised. Nothing more nothing less. I enjoy the selection of clothing it offers. Cute, Chic and Sophisticated pieces for every occasion. And the prices are great!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"You can get everything from Shein, absolutely fantastic selection! The clothes look as seen and sizing is accurate. I would suggest an option of knowing which items are in the UK Warehouse so you can order knowing that you will get the items in a few days. The Voucher and Points system is great for making a saving! Shein is my go-to for filling up my suitcase for holidays"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app, amazing options and great prizes. The only problem I have is small - searching for certain things can get complicated because the app does not understand everything you search and does not give alot of options for large items. Other than that I am satisfied"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Was not sure about ordering but my daughter bought swimwear and it was real cute, good quality, and affordable. So I put a good order in of a variety of dog clothes. I was real impressed with the quality. And my dog loves Hello Kitty so she was real happy. She has piled all her new clothes infront of her dog house and lays on them. Lol I just placed an order for me for a variety of clothes and accessories. Bought a couple xmas decorations to. Im hooked at this price."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"My last order which I ordered on 06/01/2020 didnt not arrive yet. They have mentioned that they couldnt deliver due to no response from the customer. But clearly i was at home on the date mentioned and now I have been asked to collect it from customer care, whereas they havent mentioned customer care number or a link to their support. And also the comments on delivery tracking are so poor and unclear. We expect you to be better than this. Shein was a really good company. Not anymore"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Everything in this app is very affordable and fashionable the craziest part is that I wish I could buy all the items but am broke , nevertheless the app is very functional,easy to understand and use but the thing is that am not sure that if this app is a scam or something but I think it's not ,but at the end of the day am very happy to purchase items from Shein ❤️ love from South Africa 🇿🇦"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like the plus / curvy clothes available, however the amount of items available appear to be limited. I had 3 tops I wanted to purchase which were in my cart, and 1 week later each of the 3 items were listed as OUT OF STOCK WITH NO INFO ABOUT WHEN THEY WILL BE AVAILABLE AGAIN! 😔"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Everything is very cheap quality, sizes are always a guessing game and you can't rely on the reviews to help you decide because they offer rewards for reviews. You could get the same stuff from Wish for a fraction of the price. Customer service is terrible. It's almost impossible to get ahold of anyone and I waited almost 2 months for a refund. Not wasting more time or money with them."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've been facing the order delay issues from the last month and I've been trying to contact your customer executive but every time I'm not getting any response. ""Sorry, manual services are busy currently"", this is what I'm being heard whenever I have tried to call your customer executive from the past month. They are other issues as well. I'm really not happy with your service and thus you've forced me to write a negative review here."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Love the extensive choice .. could do better with some items in quality... however very impressed generally... thank you .. app easy to use and spot on functionality with wishlist and choice of similar alternatives.. love the photos and reviews of customers 😀 ❤️
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app so much I literally buy clothes off it every week. I've already got more clothes coming in about a week. Delivery is very fast and reliable and the materials are very nice and comfortable to wear and looks awesome. My friends are already asking where I got them from so I'll be definitely recommending this app to all of them.. thanks SHEIN
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It takes a bit of ordering to understand the products available on this site. After a while you do learn to be a better and therefore more satisfied SheIn customer. It pays to always read the reviews and any and all info offered up by the seller about anything you wish to order. Don't second guess any sizing stats, order up a size or down a size accordingly. Personally, I've found the sizing on this site far more accurate than a sister site I've also ordered from, who's name I won't say"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Absolutely love it!! Only thing I'd ask for is separate categories the different types of shirts. Feels like I have to go through 20 or 30 before I find one my style. Love the prices when I do though.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Second time opening the app and asked to rate it, so I'll give 3 stars so far. Finding it a bit hard to navigate and wish there was an AU size match. Have purchased from the desktop site before and I've always been impressed with Shein and fast postage in Australia."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The best online shop but lost a star because the shipping was more complicated than it should have been and they came at a wrong time that the time showed they were supposed to be there by and that caused some unnecessary drama. And they had to redeliver my stuff three times because one of the delivery truck decides to come at midnight lmao and of course no one was awake 😭🥲😂🤪. But I will continue to use this site as there is so many awesome clothes and decor on there I love and want.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great and reliable app. The clothing items are very trendy and fashionable. The stuff I've bought are of excellent quality. You get your items in quick time. I'll definitely keep purchasing on Shein.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is a great online store with reasonable prices and great quality, every item i bought i was satisfied with these items include jewellery, bags, clothing and eyelashes. I would definately recommend shein to anyone who loves online shopping. The shipping is quick and items are delivered as outlined in the order details. Shein is definately my favourite store of them all"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Don't ever shop from this app. They've taken my money twice and not delivered the parcel they told it an issue in transit we'll refund. I've called customer service argued on live chat they asked me to wait, I've been arguing for 2 months then they asked me to wait for a week and later they marked issue as solved and closed my issue ticket. They're frauds and this is not the first time that this happened. CHEATERS."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I think SHEIN is like no other app that I've ever come across. It's very interactive and self empowering. The clothing are very good looking and good quality, there are designers from around the world, heck, I could become a designer, or a brand ambassador. I enjoy this app to the fullest and I recommend it to everyone."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ok so I gave this one star for your attention , I'm sorry you have lots of good reviews . Anyway I have a great advertisement idea , the song shine, Jesus , shine but instead it's shein , Jesus , shein , I think it's really good it would definitely get my attention and I would download immediately just for the banter, hope you take my suggestion and good luck with your app!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,My 17 year old daughter introduced me to Shein. She's always wearing the cutest things and still is able to save money for college because of the great prices Shein has. Now I'm able to do the same! Quality of the merchandise is wonderful and prices are amazing. The app is so easy to use. I love that they allow the customer to be apart of it by posting pictures and their comments.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Clothes are great quality for the prices. Some outfits are hit and miss but that comes along with online shopping. Overall worth the download and its much better than most shopping apps.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love the app it's so easy to find what you want. The quality of the clothes are just simply divine I love the clothes from here so much and so do my daughter's. SHEIN has an amazing range of household stuff and cute accessories. It's my new favourite place to do a clothes shop. I'm obsessed 😍
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Lots of filters to search what I'm specifically looking for. Unbeatable prices. Quality is good for the price. Shipping time is is not too long. Only negative, shoe prices aren't as cheap as other online stores."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great prices, quality, and fast shipping. Ordered a lot from them so far and everything has been great! Do look at reviews before ordering though, since some items might need to be sized up or down, they are great place for children's and men's clothes too!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Honestly I use this for emergency clothing more than anything. Like if I have an event coming and I can't afford to go to the mall for cloths ill go here. They are really plus size friendly so that's a plus! Probs the only place I can fine boots the fit my one size 10 foot and my other size 11 foot (i broke its always swollen so complex shoe buying is new to me).
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Looove this app... Soo quick and easy to use... Get offers, allows you to hold items in a basket for ages, and you earn points/vouchers... Far superior to Wish as you actually receive the item(unless sold out), which it does tell you how many items are left?... Vast array of items... 💜💜💜"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great selection of items though it is very hit or miss on quality. I have gotten a lot of cute pieces and only have had to return a few things. I love that you can also earn points towards your next purchase.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have bought a lot of clothes through this app and out of 40 items I have only returned 2 things because of sizing. I'm a plus size women and usually wear a 4x and have had such great luck finding affordable CUTE AND SEXY clothes. I love this store... maybe a little too much 💰💰 lol
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This website is the best but they have one problem sometimes it takes so much long time to deliver the product and sometimes it automatically cancelled the product I don't know it why it happens but it hurts when you want something lil bit faster thn other websites and they makes you upset but still I love this site coz they brings you the best quality and cute stuffs❤
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great prices. Timely delivery. Surprisingly good quality. There's such a huge selection & various different options for payment plans. Promotions & sales running at all times
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Taxes high shipping high. Long waiting periods to receive packages. Material is somewhat ok when it comes to some clothing idems. They do have cute things for plus size women just needs revise the collection of clothing at something new. Full figure women love looking cute. Not just small framed women and bigger size footwear don't hurt.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like the clothes I bought. Good value for money and everyone complimented me. However, this time the items I bought are taking far too long to arrive. 3 weeks have already passed. This is the only disadvantage, otherwise I really like the fabric and the style as well. Thanks."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Mt experience have been always fantastic with shein. I am very happy with prices and discount offers at the same time. Quality and materials of the item always up to the mark. And goof fashion senses available their too. I hope keep on doing their good efforts and male customer happy for long. Highly recommended this app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Great prices, but you basically have to guess your size for it to fit properly since their sizes do not match. Shein rewards you points for reviews and checking in 1 cent at a time then expire the points on you, so you can't save them over time to add them up for a purchase."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Most items are of a good quality and with a good price. The regular shipping is rather slow, something to keep in mind if you aorder something for a special date, make sure not to order last minute unless you want to pay more for faster shipping."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have had great experiences with Shein. They have a wide wide variety of products and deliveries are made within the mentioned times. You can also track your package all the way. I really enjoy shopping on Shein.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This shopping site has really good deals & prices. You must be wary of a lot of their clothes and make sure to read the reviews 1sr before purchase because a lot of their t-shirts, tank tops, shorts, jeans & pants are made out of that real cheap Slinky polyester type and a lot of their sizes are extremely small like a womens size LG would fit a small medium. On the other hand I bought a great hair crimper we're about 40 bucks and a doggie water filter bowl that they love"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"For the first time, I tried to order in this website just to know what quality of items they have here and i was impressed with all the items I received. Although it took me awhile to add the items i want in the cart because i wanted to check for reviews before i go purchased them. I was satisfied in the end."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,A lot of the clothes are so beautiful and at very fantastic prices! I order most of my clothes from this site and have never been disappointed with what I've received!! Very affordable and lovely clothing and shoes true to size! I've recommended to many people and got them hooked as well!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a very good on line shop to have at your finger tips ,great clothing lines and really cheap have mostly got clothing for my daughter and also grandchildren from here their clothing is great.sizeing is good too .the baby,s clothing is really cute for little girls and great for boys too. Over all a great place to shop."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I applied to return an item because it was too big and I wanted a refund. They told me to keep the item because I'm lucky and they'll refund me. I was buzzing and it made me have a lot of faith in the company. Little did I know that they had decreased the cost of the item by 5 pounds on the app, and were going to refund me like I had bought it after it was put on sale."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Amazing quality for amazing prices! I'm so sick of going to stores like Forever 21 and blowing a lot of money for a small amount of items. This app along with Romwe both combine quality and affordable prices to make it the best shopping experience ever!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,App is simple enough to navigate and very user friendly. Quality is of exceptional standards and shipping usually takes places before the expected delivery date. Overall my experience has been an extremely excellent one.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I don't know if it is some malfunctioning of the app, but most of the times when you scroll down you constantly see the same items mixed with new ones. It's kind of annoying, actually..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"You really get what you see and plenty of honest reviews to feel secure in your purchases! Such pretty and unique stuff that I can't find other places, plus all at fantastic prices. They can also send text notifications for sales if you like that sort of thing"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is great and easy to use! It makes searching and shopping easy. It's easy to add coupons and other discounts to your order. They promptly send out emails to let you know about your order, and the delivery dates given have always been accurate for me. I love this app!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I placed a Christmas order for my Granddaughters wish list. It arrived when they said it would. The quality of the items were as described in the photo. Overall good experience. Pleased with their prices as well. I will shop with Shein online again in the near future.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Some/most garments and products are good. However quite a few are not what you see when ordering. When buying on sale, it's disappointing when you don't get what you see, and think you're ordering, and you can't return the items."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Prices are very good , but some of the clothes are a little too skimpy for some of the kids that love this app. They should put some kind of a parental lock system on the app. All in all, I love this app. Clothes are good quality (all that I ordered) and people said it takes forever to get your orders , NOT TRUE, my stuff came before the time they said it would arrive and it was during the holidays. Most big stores, not to mention any names (am*z*n) took longer than they did to receive my order"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This is probably the best online shopping clothing app ever found. I am also obsessed about how much clothing is on this app and how many sizes to choose from. But I'm also a bit disappointed because my daughter likes platforms, but her shoe size is size 3, and there's no shoe size 3 platforms I have found. But overall, I am obsessed with this app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Good prices for fair quality products. But! They commerce free shipping for every order above a very small amount but you end up paying for it even if you are an S3 member... as per this, even if you add a coupon you end up paying the original prices of the products. And please... STOP SENDING this stupid auto reply for every issue!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My only complaint is that it takes too long to get the app installed. I've been waiting for one hour for installation to complete and it's still just on half of the way to being complete. Once I finally get the SHEIN app installed and order some things, I'll be sure to come back on to give a review on whether or not I like SHEIN. Signed: Ruthie McQueeney 🙂"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like cute clothes I can afford! Make sure to read comments from people who have boughten the clothing item already, sometimes the sizing is off or a weird material etc, people will post pics in the reviews so you can see the item on someone other than a model :) super helpful."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I have been well pleased with all items that I have ordered from SHEIN. At this time the only drawback is that because of COVID the shipping is taking longer than expected. I do however appreciate the extra level of precautions taken before the package is shipped. I will periodically continue adding pieces to my wardrobe from SHEIN.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've bought clothes and home things from Shein before it came to United States. I was happy with all my purchases, and they had things shipped right away. The only thing I don't care for is the way they pick the people for the free trial thing they have. I think it should be more random and not aim for people that buy things more frequently. I think the people that aren't buying are scared to buy and would be more than happy to leave a review then probably start purchasing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I have changed my address several times on here and it continues to default to an address I lived at 4+ years ago. I tried talking to the customer service robot and of course didn't get any help at all. There needs to be a change in customer support and changes made to the app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I loved it and used it often. However today it logged me out and now whenever i try to log bsck in through Facebook (which is what I was previously logged in under) it says that the app is in development or that my log in cannot be completed. I also tried logging in with the email associated with my facebook and it says that the account doesnt exist.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Affordable and stylish accessories. This app is really on fire!! Items come very fast whenever I paid extra for shipping. You can get free shipping too, but the items take longer to come. Overall 10/10 experience."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love love love their clothes! Any outfit imaginable can be bought through Shein!! Why so?? Well, because they cater for every persons unique styles. Whatever the Genre, function, style, event, fashion sense and budget, always choose Shein!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Actually really good. Some of the clothes are smaller but I have had a beautiful dress and trousers for an incredible price. Really quick delivery. Excellent return service. Refund was super quick. Great find.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is very good and professional I can say the only problem I have would be the shipping part of it, so I was suggesting that having Depos or pick up points just like Takealot has world wide would help with the delay of our orders (although we're made aware of how long they'll take). thank you"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I used to like shein before I realized how bad it really is, the reason the items are that cheap is because y'all are using unethical practices to make your products. Not sustainable and it also fast fashion. But this what I've read or heard about shein on the internet. If it's not this way, maybe y'all can be more transparent about your products and practices?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Most of my order was really good, but when it comes to the refund, all i see is a joke. You're not professional by any meaning!! While I am at work, the delivery associate calls me that he's on his way to pick up the stuff!! Can't you be more organised and give me a specific time? The next day I waited for him, and he never showed up and never answered my calls. Then the office gave me aONE RING LITERALLY! phone was in my hand they hung up before i answered i called back they cancelled on me."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Don't order from shien, I made my first order with them excited to get a bunch of new clothes, I ordered over $400 worth of clothes from them and once I received them, more than half of the items inside the box were COMPLETELY covered in mold, I also did not receive one of my items aswell, the issue proceeded to go ignored and unanswered for months, they then proceeded to tell me ""the it was not missing"". Present day, I'm told the issue is ""past due"" due to their negligence, save your money."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Horrible app. You can't change your email address. What app doesn't allow you to change your email address? So i have to delete my account and create another. But I am not allowed to delete the account because I have had orders recently delivered. 🤷🏼‍♂️
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"At first thought I didn't think it would be this good but now after using it. I like it : it's helpful , great deals, and the cuties cloths ever. I recommend this app it has cloths to fit you personality or just something to change it up a bit. Whatever it is this site will not disappoint."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Super annoying that you cannot talk to anyone. Their customer service is some automated chat thing super ridiculous. You do not get a full refund if stuff doesn't fit they deduct a $9 fee off your refund amount. Annoyed that I can not talk to anyone so I won't be using them again.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Best online shopping app I've had, everything is in order, payment methods are quite easy and reliable. I was hesitant at first but not anymore. I expected the shipment process to be a drag but No..Things got here fast and earlier than anticipated. Highly recommended."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Am really not happy with the app I have several horrible experiences through my orders but the last one makes me decide that enough is enough , they made me pay import tax of 50% of my order value, and when I clame they said pay, receive then claim 🤬 however I wanted to pass my experience for the other to avoid the same thing. It's really a waste of time and money"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Some items have been outstanding while others have left much to be desired. The inferior items have been okay, but just didn't meet my standards of quality. I'm sure that others would have found them acceptable even though they might have missed the mark of being of high quality. Nevertheless, I give this site 4 stars based on my experience. I have only ordered once, but I ordered about a dozen items and found that most of them met or exceeded my expectations."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app for functionality, atheistic, and overall content [shopping] choices. Ads in the beginning of app our annoying, but not overwhelming. Overall serves its purpose to a fault."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like the clothing style on this app. Being a full figured woman sometimes it's hard to find clothes that are pretty and sexy. The clothes here not only are pretty, sexy, and make you feel good, but the quality is really nice, it's not that expensive, it's true to size. It does take a little long to get your stuff, but to me it's worth it"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love Shein. I have been ordering clothing and accessories for my whole family for a year now from them and they have not disappointed me once! Everything is good quality at amazing low prices and they are very size inclusive. I honestly rarely go to stores anymore since I order most of my attire from Shein!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love this site. 😀 happy with 98% of items ordered. I did get one item that was broken on arrival. Returning it and reimbursement was simple and easy. Love earning points and coupons for discounts. Clothing is true to size. I recommend them for sure
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I think Shein is a great app for affordable prices. I always end up getting amazing quality t shirts. Although, I find some of the models inappropriate. I like to shop on this app, but I can't when I'm around my family, or my nieces and nephews."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Well, my experience is that Shein needs to fix their app. It does not let you checkout with PayPal. Everytime you click checkout it either says ""timeout"" or that there was a server error and there working on it please try again. But no matter how many times you ""try again "" it never checks out with PayPal. Fix this issue and I will update my review."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Their service is really great and fast because I got my order within 2 weeks and I love their products so its a 100 out of 10 for me !😍😍 but Shein also tried to take money from my bank account a month after I purchased dresses . So, ive decided not to buy anything from Shein again, although their products is a great quality but i'd rather be safe than sorry"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I have gotten all of my purchases I have never had a bad thing to say, yes some clothes may run a bit big or a bit small if sizing is not all right and I have received things meant as clothes but are not good material but thats what you get for shopping on things like this. I still purchase items so really all good."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Since discovering this app, I have enjoyed it! Love the low prices and large selection of everything. I have purchased clothing ( order size up or two), jewelry, and doggie items. Every week I find new stuff added! Shipping and delivery is quite fast too."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Easy to navigate app. Comfortable material, good customer service, quick deliveries, actually they under promise and over deliver. I would recommend the return courier to be the same as the one that delivers. Is expensive to return their products."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The is literally the best shopping app I've ever used. The choices are amazing, sizes are true, great discounts, shipping is super fast, and best of all big orders are not left at the door step. If it can't fit in the mailbox and you're not home, they allow you to pick it up from the post office."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's an easy to use app. Products are great quality. Wide variety to select from. Like it very much that you can see people with the product and reviews before purchasing. Shein is great. Would recommend it to everyone
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Everything about this app is just perfect ! No deceiving shoppers with beautiful pictures . what you see is what you get ! In my experience I even received a much better quality clothings & accessories for the price I paid for ! 100% honest review . Love it ❤‼
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It's horrible because you check in everyday for points but when you have enough and getting ready to check out, they charge you more even though you have the right amount to buy that item like if you have $10.00 and if the item is $5 they charge you $15 and the coupons don't help worth anything shein is a rip off."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A great experience all round, everything you could possibly want is in this online store. Affordable prices and good quality items ❤️. Easy to find what you are looking for. Arrive in good time and well packed, can't fault it all. I would definitely recommend x"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've ordered from shein a few times and have had no problems with app or receiving the items I have bought. I suggest always reading reviews and remember you get what you pay for, meaning quality is not the best but still always matches description."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this app from the range of styles and accessories to choose from, also the affordability is the icing on the cake. I get complimented everywhere i go on the outfits i ordered off this site. Only thing i would be aware if is to read the item discription all the way through so you dont make a bad purchase."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"My experience with Shein has been a good one. I would however, recommend the app be improve so that customers can add unlimited items to shopping card and is able to select what needs to be purchase, without having to delete or sent the items not being purchased at that point in time."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've had this app for a long time and I've never had a single issue, most of the items are selling for a good price and they ship out with good time. As long as you read the description and size info you shouldn't have problems."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"very easy to use and there's a lot of items for sale from clothing to cat socks. my only minor complaint is that there are sometimes multiple copies of the same item for sale. They're the exact same thing, so why is it listed twice or three times? Other than that its a great app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was really pleased with my first (part of the) order that I received. Good quality products. But the other half of the order wasn't delivered, even though on website it says it's been delivered. Quite disappointed. The live chat sends automated replies unrelated to my query. And I haven't received any acknowledgement email for the email I sent. It would've been easier if they had a customer service number for France."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,While looking in the app and at all of the products it would be nice to show a small heart which would indicate the items that the customer has put on their Wishlist. Also while shopping it should show items that customs have already put in their shopping cart.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app, very easy to use, customer service available 24/7 Very reasonable price. Great online shopping app. I love shein. Always upto date, you can find all trending clothes, makeup, jewelry and more in reasonable price."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I don't recommend this app! Fraud company! I had a good experience using Shein for almost 2 years but they are turning into a fraudulent company. I order two packages and they separated the two and delivered one and the other wasn't delivered which was worth $400. They didn't deliver the package or refund my money. So I will have to take legal measures. So I don't recommend this app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I normally hate shopping online bc the sizes are always wrong but I have had very few problems with the sizing with Shein. The only issue is it takes 2-3 weeks once you place your order to get your items.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I do like the app but trying to leave reviews for your purchases is painful as it tends to drop the information and pictures you have put in before you can submit it. Super frustrating when you are asked to review and are offered rewards for your reviews but the mucking around involved to actually post them is not worth the rewards you get!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I use to Love Forever 21 and now they no longer ship to Canada so my heart was broken. A friend suggested I try SHEIN and it's similar clothing with a bigger plus size selection along with many accessories, I was also happy to see the men's selection was awesome as well because I do love buying men's hoodies and jewelry. I just made my first order can't wait to use my selfie stick and show off my new threads. I will update when I receive my haul. 😁"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love SHEIN clothes, I can't seem to stop myself from not shopping from SHEIN. It's so addicting to get into!!! That's the best way to explain!!!! Hope this helps and never really had bad outfits that didn't fit besides one cuz I didn't like how it fit on me but other then that I've been really happy with the clothes and other stuff I get. Mwah"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I wasn't a online shopper, but love shein. Always find what I am looking for. So many varieties of clothing accessories, home, kitchen and so so much more. Love shopping here but nowhere. Prices are very reasonable. Quality is always good. Can't say enough to describe. Just awesome. Amazing experience shopping online. ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app...great prices..great quality and doesn't take long to get your order at all...some of the sizing is off...but I usually order a size up...but its a hit or miss on that but easy returns...the kitchen stuff...love ...and if you love diamond painting...this is the place to get them and all the things that go along with the hobby...great Unbelievable prices also...just a all around great app!!! Definitely recommend giving it a try...you will get hooked!!! Lol
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Was sceptical at first having been conned,or mislead with other sites offering it's items at ridiculously low prices. However this site along with it's suppliers delivered all it promises and it keeps you informed at every stage of where your items are but more importantly everything I've had so far has been superb"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's okay, I hate that every time I try the free trial thing it keeps saying I failed but has no explanation as to how I failed the trials, other than that, it's got amazing quality items and clothing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Update: This app is absolutely wonderful. I love everything in here. I want so many things but I have to watch myself. I can't wait to order again. Love this app. Prices are affordable and you get coupons to use. I placed 2 different orders in one day and got them a week early then what was said.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Omg! you need to have this app on your phone. The best app on playstore I guess. It has so good options for clothing, shoes, accessories, bags. And the deals are unbelievable Buy 1 get 99% of another apparel. 80%. of on clothing (like seriously). And you even get points on logging in every day, reviewing items you bought, and even updating your own bio (wow). And it even has different sections for clothing for Women, Men, Plus Size Women. Just Download it. Very happy with this app. Thanks Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have enjoyed have reasonable priced fashion here. Shipping is at a decent time frame and the products have been of good quality. Give it a shot if you are working a budget and want some quick fashion add ins.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein App works excellent, easy to navigate, sort and search for anything with Shein. Purchased items easily to see and return if needed. A really smart app. Can not fault it."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent seller never had an issue, been buying off this site for over a year. Sometimes shipping is longer for some items but it's across the ocean so what do you expect. All items I've bought have been really great I've bought at least 40 tshirts 15 pants and little stuff here and there. The jeans were better then I expected. You just have to really read the sizes."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Annoying show.... BORING!!! Virtual orgy's, lots of lesbian love...

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love shein! But one thing i don't like.. and I'm sorry to say that i have one thing i dont like about shein because SHEIN IS AWESOME, but if your models didn't look so amazing in everything or i dont know i feel almost all of the flash sale/a.k.a final sale items I purchase being that they are non returnable and sales final.. it sucks that they are totally something different on me and im sure im not the only one, from what it looked like on site on the model. I ❤❤❤ shein though... i think😂"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love the clothes and accessories. Sometimes you have to be careful with sizes but overall very satisfied. App is easy to use and there is always some events and games you can earn points
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Ive ordered at least 3 times so far. I want everything so its hard to decide. I dont work so I look for sales and flash items. Always able to find something, or put in my wish section. The items are really good quality, better than expected. Love love love Shein!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Always delivered within the dates which they announced. Returns are easy with no hassle and always a quick response back. Never had any issues with delivery or returns. No items ordered have been missing, always had the full order. Reading the reviews have helped my decisions in buying an item."

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Shein overall is ok. My problem is with their delivery partner Speedx. My first package was left in front of my door. They didn't even knock which resulted in it being stolen. My second package was thrown in front of the building...an apartment building in the BRONX! Luckily the Super was able to retrieve it before it was stolen. Because of this I will no longer use Shein. Temu delivers with no problem(so far)✌️
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app. I've ordered several things from here and do all my shopping on it now. The quality is awesome for the prices. I've never been disappointed or returned something. With everything at malls or stores so expensive now it's great to have a cheap alternative to being fashionable.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This was once easy to use. After the 562nd update, the recommended items search is now extremely time consuming! If I'm unable to use or fit into an item, I choose recommended to find something similar to what I was viewing at that time... NOT A LIST OF ITEMS I'VE VIEWED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR!!! PLEASE consider reconfiguring."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The clothes are so nice, they always fit perfect. I love doing online shopping with shein as the clothes are pretty and you've got load of choices to pick out. It's so cheap as well. Xxxx"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,App is fine. Shipping and Customer service sucks. Placed an order with expedited shipping. Apparently my order was sent back for no reason!! No contact from anyone until I did some digging myself. Now I have no summer wear for my holidays next week!! Thanks for nothing. Garbage company with garbage practices.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The most amazing products and quality. I'm a nail artist and I buy so many beautiful nail art itemd. I love the clothing I love earrings like everything is awesome. Delivery is not too long to wait and pricing out of this world to get so much stuff for $100 it's amazing.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I have ordered a t shirt that wasn't suits me .so I made a return request to return the product there is no information about how to get the refund money back into your account if you have done your payment through COD . Later on I thought of keeping the product so I submit a ticket for cancellation of the request and they say they have done it but it isn't and I have to give the return .and there is also no information about the address on which I have to send the return product ..pathetic app no detail about anything also the call reservation is not available for 2-3 days ..didn't know how to contact with the customer care 😠😠😠
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm impressed. The app works 100%, delivery is quick and the quality of goods are top notch. I'm just very disappointed because lights and watches don't get shipped to Namibia. It's actually heartbreaking. But oh well......."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Its cheap, affordable and like alright quality (some of the clothes could be bigger in the busy tho). But the new update sucks tbh, when I click on the clothes it used to be fine now its like enlarged and really inconvenient."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have ordered several items from this application and so far everything turned out excellent !!! Amazing prices, good quality, superb tracking capabilities and fast service. I will continue using it and recommended."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Worst shopping app. The product which I ordered was totally different from picture. They took more than 2 weeks for refund but refunded amount was not reflected on my bank account. Then I tried to call to customer care for so many times but it was busy.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love SheIn I just wish shipping didn't take so long, but I always recommend the app and send my code. The point system is great but the points shouldn't have an expiration date due to the fact if we're saving for something big."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I haven't purchased anything myself yet but I do know a bunch of people that have and they're always super happy with everything so I've been able to live vicariously through them to learn about shein and I'm glad I did bc I love what I see so I cannot wait to finally place my order and hope it's here in time for me to take on our huge annual family trip!! That will definitely top the trip off. One trip our family need to enjoy ten fold and some awesome new things to bring along!!

I don't want the same 2 pullovers when I did not even order it and when I tried to call it says it is in waiting can't reach . So poor customer care."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was worried shipping would take forever, things would be weird fitting and off... But I have been pleasantly surprised! I do often size up, but I've gotten some very nice items for really good prices, in reasonable shipping times (within a few weeks)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have an account via the app and I had maed an order online with the same email address but the 2 haven't been linked therefore I have to go online in order to track the order. I made the order before downloading the app. I can't even get help or track my order. It's all so frustrating coz they leave you chatting to a robot 😤
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The Shein App is very good. I have had a really good response using it. It's easy to order and return goods if necessary. Very user friendly and excellent response times from any queries. They also have very good incentives to earn points.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have yet to order but I am excited to do so. This is a mix of pinterest and shopping. A wide selection style to suit anyone's taste. I was instantly won over with the cute, stylish and yet modest bathing suits!"

I had given them quite a few Chance's to mend their errors, but to this day I'm still missing (5) items. Shein is a terrific app. I can honestly say I am hooked. The quality 👍👍👍👍👍 of their clothing line is wonderful! I would highly recommend them🤗."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love this site. The variety of clothing and accessories is unreal! Cant beat the prices and for the most part the quality of the merch is good. The review's from other shoppers are necessary and fun to read. The great deals and added extra % of savings will get you hooked. If your balling on a budget this site is for you!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Awesome! I'd recommend to pay attention to the size chart. I love everything I've bought thus far and also my son. I have sisters and niece who have bought from shein and they also love it. I appreciate the coupons and points that they always give customers the opportunity to gain.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love shein, sure it's not the Best material but at the prices who wants to keep clothes forever. The stuff I have ordered has been great, easy to pack and travel with. I do alterations on my clothes because of my body shape. But I do this with all clothes I buy."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very good app. I'm able to navigate without any difficulties. The searches and filters are super responsive and you get many similar items as well.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The customer service is ALWAYS 5 stars for sure! Clothing quality actually pay good. Wanted to be realistic overall in this rating so I give them a 4.5 stars! Prices are extremely cheap and they normally deliver items much faster than originally told. I don't know the behind the scenes but I hope they're paying their workers enough and treating them with respect. If so great company all around!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app so much! Like, who doesn't want to treat themselves once in a while? Definitely me! They have good deals and cute items to match your aesthetic! I would totally recommend this app! (They even have items for your house!)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,App is good and easy to manouvre. Clothing size is getting inaccurate especially the China made. Recent sizes are ALL out and not wearable. Not even one piece Very dishonest. Ask for refund haven't received. Sending back is ridiculous and expensive and encouraging them to keep sending wrong sizes. If you want make it international better get your sizing correct. This dishonesty has to stop.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this app, so easy ti use and you can see everything from ordering, processing, shipping and refunds. The ordering process is super fast and you can check the shipment details and everything, this is the best app so far, you won't be disappointed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,SHEIN is a brilliant app! I was apprehensive about it at first because I couldn't believe how cheap some of the items were. If you leave reviews you get points which you can use to pay for some of your orders. I highly recommend this website :)
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love how interactive the app is. I can watch videos and see new items. Also the discounts are awesome. You can wait for sales to get the best deals on some good clothes.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"LOVE LOVE LOVE SHEIN... Their clothes & prices are AMAZING, good quality clothes, pretty fast shipping & when your read the description it is absolutely true. Couldn't ask for a better clothing app. Only thing I don't like, is that the shoe sizes are in European sizes & I have no idea what size I wear, other than that it is absolutely amazing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Everything I have bought so far I am very happy with ...very good products and material used.... Okay some items needed to be taken up...but at least the material was in them if I had been a taller person...yes very happy!!! Shipment is also improving now that we have gotten through Covid...last order I received earlier than the predicted time.... Lastly but by no means least...I absolutely love their prices.... Real reason I shop with them!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Great app but if your short you will struggle to find a length that fits you for things like long dresses, trousers, jumpsuits, jeans, long skirts. You would need to find cropped or mid length items if you want something long for your height."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Very satisfied with my first time buying from Shein. Still in the process of learning the app. Time frame is excellent for delivery. The tops I bought is right to the size and the material is nice, soft and not too thin. Love the colors Placed a second order Should arrive here next week. Cannot wait to see it. My mom also placed her order."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely LOVE this app! I've been shopping from Shein for years now and just got the app a few months back and it definitely makes it easier and quicker to shop. You can even check in daily to earn points which can be used on your purchases!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is my order number YAK86831. I received a broken bracelet. Unboxing video is also been shared. And in another bracelet set, there are dents. It's been 5 days since I have highlighted the issue and I have not received even an acknowledgement. What the hell is this. Unable to call them and even not receiving any reply on their chat process. Very poor and pathetic customer services do not purchase anything. It is waste of money and time"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,How do you guys put up with a site that has no customer service? Seriously thats the most important feature an app/site should have. My teen daighter ordered from there a few times but last order never arrived and there is nothing we can do! I just dont get how so many ppl are ok with chancing losing money for NOTHING. I'm nervous about ordering myself after that. I never seen any site without CS. I think it's funny how ppl give 5 stars not caring there's no CS UNTIL They to don't receive items
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Never have been disappointed and ordered big orders about 4 times now. One order for lost and I never recieved it, and customer service was great and I got my money back in my account 2 days later. I used that money and re ordered the same order and got it within a week and a half! So it was just a fluke and flukes happen!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"No problems with app, works well. Wish I'd known about Shein Curves years ago……at last, affordable fashion for the larger figure and an accurate size chart that ensures the clothes actually fit perfectly when they arrive. Ordered several times now, without any problems."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have ordered many items of clothing from Shein and I love all the clothing I have received, certainly worth the money. My daughter and my sister also love Shein. Ordering is easy and they have always delivered on time and all items come in thier own packaging. Good quality, would recommend Shein to anyone who loves to shop and enjoys great value for money."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I am a tier 3 member and purchased 70.00 worth of items. I paid an expedited shipping fee and items are supposedly coming a week after estimated delivery date. No updates given on app about changes. Spoke with customer service and company will not refund expedited shipping fees or give coupons to try to compensate the loss i incurred for wrong delivery date. Shein Offered 50 points which is .50 cents in us $. Terrible customer service
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this app. So easy to navigate, so much choice in so many sizes, definitely take advantage of their measurements to avoid returns. It's great my daughter can add to my basket from her phone & shows straight away"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The daily new clothes tab sometimes glitches out and will not show the next day's clothes after checking another day, but other than that the app is great and easy to use! (Edit: Now I am having problems with being able to pick sizes to search for; there is little to no variation available for sizing filters!)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,it's great I would 100% recommend it's really easy to use and if you have an issue it doesn't take long for customer support to help you I do think they should add a dark mode to it tho but it is an overall great app!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great selection of good quality clothing, shoes, and accessories for any style! A lot of items come directly from China, but shipping is a maximum of only 2 weeks. Easy to use app. I love SheIn!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I have placed an order for 2 tops before 3 weeks.O got only one and while attempting to return it is showing return is not available for the address.And for the second top as it was not received in time i tried to cancel the order.I have given delete order option for this.Now my order record has been disappeared.I paid for the order.And now there's no way to track second delivery.Highly disappointed.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,For clothes quality is poor. You can look for accessories hera at low proce. Warning for return policies... Its not very customer friendly. I have returned few clothing items but when the will refund money there is no notification update or anything. Moreover if yo want to return you have to pay some amount or currier it yourself . Hope I have recieved my money
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Pretty good online shop. Things are cheap and durable. Only issue is the long period to wait for packages but once you have time to wait they are worth. Also be sure to read the reviews as some products are not as good as others.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very useful n time saver with so many options ....but we want to add some more options like beauty and electronics....so it will more helpful...it will awesome when they will sell Korean skin products too...although it's very good....
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I tried to delete my account and there was an account order incomplete error, i reached out to customer service as this was in March, and was told that they put in a request to delete my account, here it is a month later, and i was told again today my request was marked as urgent and forwarded to a higher up department. I will be filing a complaint with the BBB. As well as submitting a ticket on Shein. Update: they continue to lie and send default messages"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Easy to use and quick delivery. I have only received one item I was really disappointed in, I ordered a beautiful top in baby blue but when it came it was a dirty grey looking color, I thew it in the garbage and was so unhappy as I was so looking forward to wearing it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Looks like a good shop. Whoever you must have used google translator cause it makes no sense the translarions. I'm portuguese, but I don't understand a single word. I worst part i can't even change the language to English! Cause it keeps in a strange Portuguese. I even took Screenshots of some produts. Heres an example, a pijama short and shirt, you wrote in portuguese: pocket connection contrast front of Bouton elegant... I mean.. It makes no sense. So please see who is doing the translation!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Been shopping for years more hits than misses. Love the selection and variety. Great prices and deals. Really gives you an opportunity to create your own style and build a great wardrobe that you can afford.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app!! You can buy the cutest clothes, decor, accesories and more. It has the biggest variety on everything. It suits everyones style. Perfect for any gender or age. 10/10 definitely recommend!❤️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"So far it's been a mixture of nice things and way too cheaply/poorly made things. Their customer service is top notch. If you have an issue with your order they don't dismiss you like a lot of companies do. The shipping is a little much more than I thought it might be, but that's how most places are."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My account was hacked twice within 2 months and the only solution offered the first time was to delete my account. I lost my points and everything! It takes them forever to email you back or respond to any issues! This time I was told to choose a better password! Seems like the bigger they get the less they care about their customers! Worst customer service ever!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"BUYER BEWARE - I Ordered from SHEIN my package arrived very damaged and several items I ordered were missing. THEY WILL NOT REFUND ME! Customer service keeps telling me to look harder in my box for the missing items, and keep sending me the same message over and over. Don't even bother messaging them, just file a charge back with you bank. All they will do is waste your time."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"This app is having amazing stuff but now this app is getting so drastic. I have placed many orders in march, april, and may i am not getting any movement in my orders. And also for delay they do not provide compensation. They also stopped giving points for join in contest and even reduced the no. Of points to be collected from daily reward. I am getting disappointed now even after being regular customer of shein. Thanks"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shien is super easy to use and I love it so much! The only thing that I would change is how fast things arive, but it's reasonable because of how far away it is being shipped. I recommend it because of the amazing cheap prices that you can't find anywhere else, plus great quality!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Yes, the product are cheap and affordable BUT the logistic really sucks... like it is worst , it takes 2 weeks for the package to be delivered.. before it is just a week and that is understandable but now it is worse than ever, 1 week alone is already a long time to wait for the package. Better to order beforehand than to order closer to the date you need it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The only way to find out if this app was good for me was to download and I'm very pleased with it ive ordered several items from this site they are good quality some items can take a while to arrive so as long as you don't order last minute for holidays or occasions there's plenty of different styles to suit.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Customer Service from SHEIN is one of the worst and they have issues with SHEIN gift card being stolen for use by others without any proper solution. Writing to customer service is like talking to a robot who doesn't seem to understand the seriousness of the problem. There's theft happening and someone steals your customer's gift card which is stored in Shein's system for use. The platform is not secured and trustable. Otherwise, SHEIN does have very affordable lifestyle pieces of many options."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,very nice app with very nice quality things with low prices. the only downside is that it takes quite awhile to ship along with the fact they may not have good selection in size for the things you want.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Love all the different variety available from clothing to home goods and many others to choose from ❤️ One thing that can use some improvement is different options for sizes when it comes to sets like bra and panties there should be two different sizes for top and bottom.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"A really good shopping map n good products made horrible by all the delivery experiance. Its not even about late delivery, its just that almost all delivery man i met till now totally unprofessional. They made every excuse to not come to my doorstep. Whats the point paying delivery charge if i have to go take it myself"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love Shein.....from the items it sells to the quality and most definitely the price. I only wished the deliveries were quicker, and to top it all of they introduced ""Clearpay"" what more could you ask for. Well done Shein for making it easy for customers like me ❤💯"

Not enough cute items for Plus-size fun people. Why shop here when the selection is minimal at best? Why are the fabrics polyester or rayon/ viscose? Those are the worst fabrics for spring & Summer! Where are the cottons, linens, etc.? The breathable fabrics."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,OK so I ordered 2 things a blinker set and a headlight both rechargeable and the blinkers have a wireless remote. Well the headlight works just fine however the blinkers does not work at all just the tail light works and the remote also does not work. So I have tried to request a return and refund and I am not able to get a response. Very bad for business and it's not OK.

Started off needing some summer clothes then next thing im ordering my kids clothes then swim suits im so hooked great app great deals and best prices!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It doesn't have withdrawal option on return money when we paid cash on delivery, products price are very high compared to other sites... We don't get back refund how much we paid exactly.. It deducts other expenses made by them and refunds less.. Material quality is poor... Delivery charges are high... Comparing other sites it's not worthy app in any way..."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Absolutely bad experience. The package did not turn up even after several weeks. Only after me contacting to customer care I got to know the package returned for some reason!! The reason also wasn't clear. Now they are keen on refund though I need the product. Worst app ever.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I submitted an order from the 22nd and there is no update on the tracking information. Things I ordered days later have already reached, at this point I just want a refund. It's impossible to get any help through the app as the system keep directing you to the FAQ. EDIT 2023. They are now combining orders, so my 3 orders under $50 each will now cost me 10k to clear and of course I cannot return the package unless I pay the custom fees and collect it. Yet they split 1 order into shipments!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,i hope they add more inclusive bra sizing I wish you could change sizing to US instead of it all being EU. I have three packages missing and am unable to locate correctly I wish you could report them missing directly in the app to solve the issue quickly
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"When I placed my order the tracking said it would come the day after Christmas. I was pleasantly surprised when it came two days before Christmas. I bought a dress, shoes and handbag. The shoes and dress were perfect. The handbag was much smaller than expected but overall my experience with Shein was great. I will be shopping here in the future. 😃"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I find it really frustrating that there isn't a separate icon to add and remove addresses. It makes no sense to have that feature only available after you've clicked the checkout button before you pay.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Purchased twice thus far and the items are of very good quality and what you see is what you get. Items were delivered earlier that expected, which is a plus. Very, very satisfied with the products and service received. Will definitely buy again."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,You can not talk to an actual person. Shipments are not received in timely manner. My package is currently 1 month late but shein has not responded to every effort to contact them. I didn't have this issue with the last order but I'll never use shein again after this experience. Sad I will have to dispute the order through my bank. USPS is no help either.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Cheap cute clothes for everyone in the family. Cute household products also. Shipping does take awhile. I love the bags they're shipped in. Clothes are super comfy. Found a bunch of useful household items. Great gifts. They also have some decent payment plans too. You also get points for buying and leaving reviews. You can spend points on more stuff.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My experience on this app has been faultless so far. It was very easy and intuitive to find the products I needed and the purchasing process was effortless. There is a wide and diverse selection of products to choose from, all of them being useful and high quality in my experience."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Stop sending wrong and missing items. I still haven't received my leggings from almost three month. Also you send the wrong skirt. Be more mindful of what you're sending if you don't have just refund our money back. Also some of the qualities are not good. I know it's cheap but please let us know the quality so we decided if we should take it or not that would be best.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Easy to find great stuff, shipping is fast. No hidden costs like other sites do, such as add on horrendous shipping costs and additional tax. Flat rate shipping fee, free if you spend certain amount. Descriptions are usually clear and are honest."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love shein. The clothes are very affordable. Also the material with majority of the clothes are really nice.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,The worst app I've ever came across. Their delivery services are terribly slow. Also their support service is the worst neither do the executives recieve the calls nor the app support service works.. Also I will never buy anything neither will I recommend anyone to purchase anything from Shein. They take the payment but do not deliver the order.. Services are terribly poor.. I hate this app will never order again....
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Love products and sales. The website needs work. You can't just back up to where you where. Instead you go through 3 it 4 ""more"" clicks to get almost there and bam you brush the wrong item and have to start over. That's when I have to give up and shop another site for awhile."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Each dress I have bought fits comfortably and look lovely. I have had a great summer wearing the dresses, receiving lots of compliments. Love using the discounts as well. Look forward to buying more."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I live in South Africa and there are hidden costs involved with these purchases. The total cost of duties and insurance (which I was not informed I had to pay) equaled half the price of my large purchase. Very dissatisfied and angry. This site has zero transparence. 0 stars. I cant find a support email address to send anything to
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love..fast shippping 90% of items have been awesome. Read reviews and size chart and youre good. Update this is still my go-to for so many items you cannot go wrong if you find something that fits very easy to look at the scription of other items and the sizing is usually right on
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I felt very bad ..because the item i received was so bad it was torn n it was soo cheap after paying a high amount i should get good quality and as i have expected but it was nothing like that .i got so bad product i just want to exchange immediately .it didnt meet my expectation.the worse item after paying maximum amount for the item. It was really very bad experience.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This app/site is addictive. Update; their customer service representatives aren't the best when you have problems with your orders. If you don't receive they'll tell you it's still en route and or wait an additional week after the expected delivery date before they attempt to do anything.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The app is really good.. The products are stylish and cool at a reasonable price.However it takes a lot of time to get the products back in stock once it goes out of stock.. I am waiting eagerly for a product to get back in stock. This thing needs to get fixed.kindly consider my request otherwise overall it's a nice experience to use this app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love the huge selection of styles, most of which are ridiculously affordable and really cute! Initially I was really skeptical but now I'm on my third order in two months and so far have loved everything I've bought. So much to choose from and you can't beat the prices!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Really low quality/low budget clothing from this site. Add to the fact that you have to pay $10 for return. What a joke. Stick to reputable retailers like aritizia or Lululemon that will provide quality products and if you're unsatisfied, provide returns for FREE. This isn't the 2000s, returns should be free, especially as we are in a pandemic and can only for the most part shop online."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"1st Buy is seamless. I was skeptical to buy anything at first due to mixed reviews. All items received quickly. They look nice on... but I havent worn them yet as they are for my holiday in June. So that will be the real test! If they have holes etc, what they do on.... But so far , so good."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This is an amazing shopping app which has each and everything thing available at it. Really good place to shop and explore. I am really impressed by all kind of things they keep. These all products are really trending on social networking website. This is a good shopping place for budding blogger on Instagram. I am taking all things from this application and u guys should also try this app. This is a wonderful place to shop for men's , children and women's. It keeps each every item . It's good."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love shein. I always order and im always extremely happy with what I receive.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Awesome app. Would lioe the option of only rating one item bought at a time if I.so choose.... So not all the items bought need to be rated ...it can be independent from each other. Other than that...its hundreds

Everything always arrives and in the time frame that it should, or earlier. I also enjoy buying things from their ""home section"".

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely LOVE SheIn, I honestly didn't know to much about it. However a couple of my friends and I had been talking about clothes and our favorite stores, the stores who seem to always have the best deals, the stores that sales hair accessories and handbags wallets belts and one of my friends spoke up and said have you all looked at SheIn they have EVERYTHING and so the rest of us we downloaded the app and personally I am so impressed, SheIn has apparel and many other items for whatever age"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"User friendly, accurate descriptions, variety of options, a search feature that works with good results. This has taken my shopping experience from an interest to a little bit of a habit."

Customer service? A joke.... 24 hours to reply to every email, and by the time you finally get a reply you've lost the will to live! The products are cheap for a reason, they're cheap materials and cheaply made..... don't bother!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've ordered 3 different times and my items have all been true to size, exactly how it looks online and came in a timely manner.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The items on the Shein app are very eye-catching. My package was supposed to arrive a month ago and I am still waiting. I was told that it is stuck at customs, I called all over in South Africa to no luck until after 17 emails, I was told to pay a customs fees before I could receive my parcel. I am still waiting. It is disappointing because It was a gift for someone. The app is promising but delivery isn't."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Like every business app at first their services are good but as they grow customer service becomes zero. My order crossed the time frame delivery, I tried to contact customer service & was asked to wait for 3days but past a week I found they themselves has closed the case with "" case solved"" remarks even though I haven't received anything nor item or mail from them. I have seen some older app than shein which does better job.Now i would rather suggest other apps to my friends&family than Shein!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Still trying to get the hang of ordering the correct size since some items are sometimes smaller or bigger at times but overall I'm satisfied with the quality of the stuff I ordered especially the tshirts I would like to see some more or the normal size clothing in the plus and curve section also thanks 😊
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So I have placed a few orders with Shein, and they DO NOT disappoint! I have loved everything I have gotten, and the quality for the prices is amazing. I would love to be a product tester, but for now I'll look forward to buying more from them, the prices are great and I love the recommendations. I also love the daily check-in for rewards.. Thanks!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is AMAZING! You can get amazing clothes for amazing prices. And for 1-5 dollar jewelry, they are pretty good. If you dont wear the jewelry in the shower or get it wet it will last for awhile. They have all different types of styles and would 10 out of 10 recommended. ❤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Good cheap clothes for low budget. They play deceitful games with the coupons. Not reputable in this area. They completely ignore customer service contacts. I buy only what is very cheap like pantyhose, gadgets and cheap wor pencil skirts."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Literally exists to scam people. The pants I bought started ripping apart after 1 use because the fabric is so cheap it reeks of China's really bad quality of products. So disgusting. Never buy from this garbage store. Plus the return/exchange is impossible and inconvenient. They really make sure you don't get a refund easily. Master scammers.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love this app and the clothes I have ordered so far fit me very well and are perfect. Just make sure you read the descriptions and comments first so you have the right size. The app is so easy to use and navigate through. The deliveries arrived well before the expected date and I only had to wait 2 weeks. Happy customer right here. I would totally recommend using the Shein App and buying from here :-)
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love shein so much it has everything u can ask for, for reasonable prices but lately i had a bad experiece with customer service when i told him an item was missing from the order he talked to me as if i am lying and want another one for free so since then whenever i get a package from them i record a video from when i open the package till i check every item so if something is missing it will be recorded that i didn't find it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app itself is OK unless/until you want to delete your account. There doesn't appear to be a way to do it on the app, and the link on the website just takes you to a shopping page. Customer service isn't reachable. It shouldn't be this difficult!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Pros-So many cute items. Low prices, quality materials for most items, free returns, user friendly app, always a coupon to use, and reasonable delivery times. Cons-Would like to have quicker shipping option and return options. I may decide after returning items from same batch to return another item still unused but it will charge me."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I've had some beautiful clothes from seeing, but it can be a bit of a gamble. Sometimes the quality isn't great. Thin materials and long delivery waits. But its cheap, and you get what you pay for so 8m happy overall"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's a great site just difficult finding home and the search bar. Other than that super easy. And loooove the clothes. Update 2/24/22 I think I order something every week. Im wearing shein everyday. Never spend over $11... My fave 💓 the pants are my fave they fit perfectly with my body. Extremely stretchy and your crack will never show🙌🏼🙌🏼💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾long ankles for long legs!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I had heard of Shein for a while but was skeptical of ordering. I finally decided to place a small order and loved EVERYTHING that I got. I have ordered many more.times after that and haven't been disappointed. At one point I had to return some items and even that was easy!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I like this app but i hate that they delet your iteams from your cart when you don't pay for them right away and that you can only get notifications about your shipping on messenger app and i don't have an accout for or facebook i don't have that. I like the prices and hate that i have to use one coupon at a time.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app works great and the products are well made! Clothes are true to size, accessories are inexpensive but not made badly, & I honestly have never been so happy with a shopping app! If Shein was an in person shopping center I would get lost in there!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,The website us very cluttered and to find the check in fir points is often hidden. Also shein has increased there prices tremendously. I think as more people started buying from Shein the prices went up. Also when you buy a item on clearance and it doesn't fit your not allowed to return it. This deters me from buying clearance merchandise..as this is a online shop and because of this you can't try on clothes. Even using measurement can be off.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Had 2 orders so far (10+ items each) and loved everything. It was all true to sizes posted and all fit really well. Some of the materials are not as expected but they still work in the garment. It all washed really well too with no shrinkage.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have already placed 4 orders since I found this app in March. Everything I have bought has been great quality. I have had to return a few pieces due to fit and the return was easy and I was refunded quickly. The app is easy to navigate.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was skeptical about this brand and app but I took a chance and I am glad that I did. I had just had my LO and needed some cute reasonably priced and cute clothes to get me through until I felt like myself to start working out. Anyway, the sizes were pretty accurate, the return process was simple ( i wasnt sure what size I was in so I ordered 2 sizes), and the clothes look like the pics."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Clothing is poor quality and not size accurate. Shipping takes too long. I had another order ready but was waiting to see what quality of fabric the outfits were and also how the sizes ran. I was very disappointed. Also when my items did arrive they had no description or size on the package and some of the items did not even have a label, much less a size. The kitchen items were pretty much junk with no description of what they even are, much less what they are used for and I had purchased them"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"All the products are wonderful and relatively cheap making it easy to get great products without having the best job. The tracking is a little off compared to tracking on ups, but overall it's a great app!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Reliable seller and items look like pictures. Quality is decent and shipping to Toronto, Canada is around 2-3 weeks typically (which I find very reasonable). Good mixture of fashion too. Overall, very happy with this company."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Totally satisfied with the colors, types of fabric, my shoes the fit and height, clothing the fit is great well, some are long at the hem length and arms, I'm only 5'2"", so short and hefty. I wear a 2-3XL but I loooove SHEIN. I Reccommend ""SHEIN"" to all my family and friends"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"App has issues on Android including a google failure message around security. It also does not have a functioning back button so when you receive an error message screen, you cannot return to the previous one"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love it! Love every item I have bought, have been ordering things for a over a year now regularly from clothes to household items and craft equipment. The quality for the price is amazing and fast postage is a huge win!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is so easy to use. Most of the clothes are of a good quality and very affordable. Ordering and returning where necessary is straight forward and they cater for all sizes. Highly recommend
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is the most helpful you'll find in the entire world, the shipping is quick and all the stuff you are buying are the same as the image in the app! They are not testing animals for its makeup and the makeup is really good! I 100% recommend you to try the app"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love this app and the products. Easy to use. The discounts and codes are super easy to apply and you can move things to and from the cart and wish-list without even having to go to the product page. Simple and straightforward and I like the products. For such affordable clothes and products they last pretty well. I have shirts from Shein I bought 5 years ago and they are still cute.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"For the most part, I love this app. But my only complaint is the romwe shop and their terrible sizing. For example: with some of their shoe sizes if not all, they skip over 9 and 9.5 and go straight to 10 and 10.5. Also their clothes never having XL or XXL sizes and it hurts me physically. They're clothes are so cute, but they pretty much only appeal to skinny white/ Asian girls. Speaking of asia, they also pretty much fetishize japan/Japanese culture (media and entertainment wise)."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app says that the product will be returned but i haven't received any return confirmation till date also when you try contacting the costomer care no. They will put you on hold for not less than 20 min and after waiting for so long you won't be able to speak to the excutativ ( it would say that all are busy and we will make sure that they call you back) which never happens . Extremely disappointed.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love this shop! My closet was so depressing because I'm broke and plus size. Basically wore black tshirt and jeans for the past 4 years. This store was. A. GODSEND!!! Trendy plus sized clothes that are actually designed for young adults and NOT middle aged mothers (no disrespect intended lol) and there's deals every day! I've only spent roughly 100$ and I've already gotten like 10 different outfits! So worth!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Its is such a great app. The packages are not, too long, but they sure do look very nice when they arrive. The clothes are not. at. all expensive and they, like I said, are in great shape and look very nice. 10/10 recommended"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Too many notifications but other than that I love it. Everything is low priced and great quality. Stuff usually will arrive in 1-2 weeks, but it's fine since everything's so cheap."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love SHEIN! Great shopping items, even better prices, and shipping and delivering 👌. Let's not forget the wonderful discounts I always receive! Thank you SHEIN for being my new favorite online shopping store! 🛍 Oh & everything comes as pictured! 🤞"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love shein because of the affordable prices but with that said it can either be a hit or a miss with the products some the quality is so rich for the pricr and others it looks nothing like what u hoped for and looks cheap n feels cheap. But i will order again in a heart beat.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am a active LinkedIn member. I Love their advertisements, and the connections. SheIn ,you guys rock an the LinkedIn crew all will agree with me on that. This year's performance blew our minds. The cast was great,the colors were out of this world, and the LinkedIn community was overall grateful to watch the performance. The models flying was very beautiful. In a 3- D view. Very Impressive, very nice. Congratulations to all of you. I wish you could help me, brand, and become flashy like you."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have ordered a nmber of items and have been very happy with all of them with the exception of the ankle straps on the sandles. I have a larger size foot and with that comes a larger size ankle. The shoes fit great but the ankle strap was not long enough to fit my ankle. I have found that I need to cut the straps and add some elastic to them so they will stretch around my ankle.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is the worst app ever, they do not deliver the item to the right person even after the payment has made. Such a reckless staff . I have been waiting for my package for the last one week. They are not responding my call properly , not at all serious about customer queries. I recommend you guys to not place orders from this. Such a bad experience I had."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,what is so wrong with the website?? why is it taking so long to deliver the order I made. It's been more than 2 weeks. plus there's no customer service...we can't even call and know what's actually happening. they have this automatic messaging thing which keeps on typing the same thing. so disappointed. never expected this from shein.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Shein deliveries are good, clothes are lovely. It's important to make sure you measure yourself to get the right fit though. Shein gives you all the details you need, so very 👍 good. I have noticed though, the clothes are not always like what's on the model."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love it coz this is tge only shop where I can buy clothes with good fit on me. Unlike in other stores, here sizes are detailed so you can really choose a good fit. The styles also are really aesthetic but I hope you can offer more styles that is trendy on Asia not only in western countries. I look forward to something that is somehow similar in korean fashion or unique styles like japanese traditional dresses"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Been using the app for a couple years and never had an issue. Some things ordered haven't always looked the same as the photo but returns are straight forward enough. Tracking has always worked.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love ordering my clothing from them. They're always ahead of delivery time and I love that their products match the pictures shown online. Definitely my favorite online store, and looking forward to ordering many more beautiful items from them."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The clothing fit and true to size for plus size girls, im (3x) , the website is easy to manage , pricing are pretty good , only complaint is the taxes , even if the shipping is free you still have to pay taxes so you mights as well try to get free shipping so you only have to pay 1 fee"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is terrific site, offering an exceptional range of products and clothing no other site offers. Their clothing selection is wide and varied, and I find outfits never seen in catalogues. While I have been ordering from this site for years, all my orders have been correct and arrived in perfect condition. Based on their outstanding performance, I will continue to use it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The quality of clothing Shein provides are good cant deny that but the thing here is that whenever you opt for free trials all the time you don't stand a chance to win, your points are being deducted without any specific reason even if you check in every single day, you can't get in touch with Live chat when you have issues with the order which I had recently received a defective broken product but couldn't do anything about it since I couldn't connect to Live chat even though Ive tried."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Don't buy from this company they are rip off. I made a purchase and I didn't receive my order. They only refunded me for part of it and doesn't have a great way to communicate with customer services. I literally feel like I have been rob and very upset over the entire ordeal. I don't think it's far that I have to jump thru loops holes to get my money back for merchandise I didn't receive.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shein is an amazing app, so many options of different clothing, jewelry and more!! However I tried to purchase 2 necklaces for my self. Payment was successful but I changed my mind so I canceled the order, I was promised a refund. I got a notification that my refund was a success but I never got it... hopefully Shein can fix this problem 🙏"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is the most fraud company I have ever shopped with. I have placed an order for battery operated fairy lights one month ago. But till now they have not shipped it yet. Though I have paid for the order previously while placing it. Next I have placed the order for the metallic butterflies and it have shown that it reached the courier hub and the status is that customer has refused to collect the order, whereas nobody from the courier hub ever called me regarding the dispatching matter."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein, their product are of good quality, the pricing is cheaper compared to what I would pay in my own country and I have done about 6 to 7 purchases already and all my deliveries was done in less than 3 weeks. I'm about to do my next purchase which are the family's Christmas present...so I'm happy with Shein and I highly recommend it to anyone!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. Delivery isn't instant, but you are updated on every step of the process. Aslong as you know your measurements and read the reviews before you order, it's amazing. 95% of the items I have received (mostly order women's and children's clothing) has been very good quality and arrived within a reasonable time considering the majority of the items come from China."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,All I can say is thank you Shein..love shopping in this app...The styles of clothing is awesome.. Earrings are very nice..I love animals and I find the cutest shirts and toys for my dogs..The sandals are really nice..I love flip flops and I always find the cutest designs and colors..The hair accessories are another item that I buy..They are well made and they have alot of different styles to choose from..I also like the artificial flowers..the vines are one item that I really like..I recommend
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Finding this company has been life changing! I love the variety of clothes, and that you can see other people with similar measurements wearing the items to get a feel for sizing and how it would look. The items themselves are gorgeous. I have yet to want to send anything back!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the merchandise! Shipping times vary. And hats arrive completely smashed. Also when I order 1 item, many times they've sent 2 and I was also charged for the multiple pieces when I only ordered the one."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I ordered 7 tops and I'm pretty chuffed with all of them 😊 a couple of the t-shirts are a little thin and the jumpers are a cross between a long sleeve t-shirt and sweatshirt fabric but all are pretty true to size. Not washed them yet to see if there will be any shrinkage or change in shape so can't comment on that.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Constantly improving, listening to customer feed back, dispite global issues. Products arrive in excellent condition and quality. Quick to explain the returns policy and how to earn vouchers and rewards. Without literally leaving you feeling guilty for shopping for all occasions and to help inspire the future fashion styles ✨️ 👌"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The app is one of the easiest to use. They give detailed information and descriptions of each item. They give you points every day for checking into the app. The points can be redeemed towards your purchases. The variety of items is amazing. التطبيق سهل الاستخدام. يعطوا معلومات وتفاصيل واضحة عن كل منتج. كل مرة تفتح التطبيق تاخذ نقاط تقدر تستخدمها عند الشراء. المنتجات كثيرة ومتنوعة.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great site so many different styles for different people, does mean you have to sift through slot to find things that's your style but when you do it's good quality, good prices and delivered quickly! Love it!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Quality of clothing is far better than expected and didn't have to wait too long for them! Coupons are a pain to use. It would be nice if automatic and combine orders to get the best percentage off. Tho I'm impressed with the variety of products, not my go-to app since there isn't an easy way to return, like Amazon."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"If I could give shein all the stars in the world, I would. Shein is a great app it never crashes or glitches, they have really nice clothing, cheap prices, and my personal favorite...shipping! I got my package 8 days earlier than expected I love you shein!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like the app, quite a few things don't come up in searches easily, specifically items around holidays such as Easter, Christmas, Halloween... but I love adding to my wishlist and thinking about it before ordering."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Although the sizes are a little wacky, once you get it right it's all good. Overall the app is easy to maneuver and reliable! The fashion is very nice and the clothes are high quality! 10/10"

Perfect fit and the blouse is not only GORGEOUS, but it also looks very nice on me and the material is extremely soft which I love as well. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!!! Finally! For reference; I got the 4XL. Thank you for making not only GORGEOUS clothing for all sizes, but, also making it affordable as well. I will DEFINITELY be ordering more💖"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I couldn't be more happy with this site fantastic quality all round,the only problem I have is with the children's sizing,some is in age some in metric just wish it was all in age size would be so much easier,if you want something for a specific time them I suggest you order earlier than you need some things can take at least 10days to arrive but if this isn't a problem then that's fine... They offer great discounts all over a 12mth period it's really good.. 100% satisfaction."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The experience thus far is excellent. What I would like for you to do is not ship my goods separately when there is an inventory. I would prefer to wait, than have my goods separately. Thanks"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I had such wonderful experience with shein. I've ordered 10 times from shein and my orders always come way before delivery date. And have never had a damaged item. Transparent and excellent app. I love it
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great prices and beautiful products. Love this app!! Shipping was great and delivered when expected. If something was late I receive an email. Read carefully at people's comments that will help you when making a choice. So far so good. I loved everything I ordered ❤️
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The best shopping app I've ever used. The layout is literally perfect and the ""Recommended for you"" section is always spot-on when it comes to things I like. I wish all shopping apps were this great!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Really great app! Super easy to use, I buy a lot of my clothes off of SHEIN. It is really nice they have a plus size section that has clothes that fit my style. Most of the plus size clothes I have found have been very basic or boring clothes so thats why I like SHEINs plus size section"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"For a business operated in China, delivery is ahead of time, always. Great styles, got almost everything you'll drool for in the Pinterest clothes section. Low/reasonable prices. Strong material, complex yet precise shipment tracking. They will notify you when your package actually arrived to your house too. You don't have to order a size up alot of the times too, say if you wore L, no need to order XL, the size's are just right. Great site."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Im plus size 2XL. And i fond this app is pretty good for finding clothes for today that is not made for the pg like Torrid. However the clothes are a bit of a hit or miss with sizing. Not such a big deal if you know your measurement. Another negative that i have come across is the clothing ive received will not be sewn together properly leaving holes and random strings. Again for the price if you have any kind of skill wth a thred and needle this is easily fixed. Material used is good.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,While ordering i thought the price shown was the cumulative of tax and the cost of the dress but after the order reached home that i came to know that GST is added differently and also while getting refund i don't get the whole amount but the amout i thought i paid i.e the price shown in the app that to while pick up cost subtracted.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Really nice stuff and the prices are amazing... just sizing can be difficult... Xs and small differ e.g the small in certain products should be extra small.. I bought small and it was too big.. but other than that its great
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The customer service part of the app used to be great, and you were able to get help promptly, now however all you get is a bot that keeps circling back to unrelated topics.... The response I received is not correct. You will still get a bot that keeps circling back and no live agent like they had originally."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I had placed my first order: an overcoat from shein few days ago, the quality was very pathetic. I had made a refund and ofcourse they charge Rs65/- .That is also fine, since we customers have to bear their loss. Its been over 3 days my return has not been picked up. The customer service numbers are not there inside application. #patheticExperience"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Not bad, I live in South Africa and I ordered clothes that cost 1,2K+, am happy with their service they arrived fast but the shipping in South Africa is expensive, I paid R430,60 for customs policy while others paid R120, and had the same amount of order value. Otherwise is a great app. With cheap and affordable quality, quality not bad."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app works well, easy to buy, shipping is usually 1-2 weeks and packing is not always very protective. I guess some of the clothes can be very different but most are exactly what they say they are. Materials are not the most organic though."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"App is easy to use, everything comes how it looks, good value for money, deliveries are on time or even early. I'm a size 14 and get xl so they come up abit lose. Would highly recommend"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"been shopping here for long, but one thing happened which makes me to uninstall this app. I ordered something that never came. I reach out to customer service so many times and the probome never being solved. And now the order is closed. I can never solve it. This app makes it so hard to get help."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's a fine app. I like that you can add search filters to more easily find something specific. There's a lot of unique options you wouldn't typically see in stores.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I really enjoyed shopping with Shein their clothes are nice and in good quality materials and well made and much affordable and not just that but also there deliveries services are so quick and so much simple and easy to keep tracking and had no problems with it so far. Surely, recommended to others. Thank you Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love the clothes and the fabrics are all different. I started shopping small until I realized that I was shopping wrong size depending on the material. I love the designs and the fabric you just gotta get the right fit.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The products are very cute. They don't disappoint. Transition time is a little long and the materials used for some of the items aren't all the best. But I absolutely love LOVE the discounts I get. At one point I was able to get free shipping on a purchase.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I've been shopping at shein for a long time now recently I've been noticing there car price and their checkout price has a huge difference and then I start investigating on it and I see that they show you one price and then they put full price on it and then they give you the discount. So eventually you get nothing discount and I've been trying to fix that with the customer service but unfortunately they stick to with their false advertisement and marketing. Im not Happy at all..
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Frankly speaking, at first I'm skeptical to try this new shopping app. But after a few times, surprisingly it works out well. Delivery usually takes 1 week, while shopee takes 2 weeks. Discount is also good, points rewarded after reviews, are much more better than shopee. I will continue to support Shein. Perhaps the return policy and process can be more easier."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's so nice to find decent clothes at a good price to for every shape and size. Excellent customer service with faster shipping than I expected. I'll definitely keep being a repeat customer.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Omgsh take all my money!!! Seriously! I'm obsessed with this app and company! If you haven't bought from them or downloaded the app you're missing out! I never want to get my clothes from anywhere else EVER!!!!!! I used to love forever 21 and target...NOT ANYMORE LOL !!!! The clothes fit like a dream, they are cute in person, they come on time, you can get points which give you discounts, plus they have other discounts....forever customer!! LIFER...till death parts us!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I am from South Africa & I am definitely very impressed with SHEIN. This is my 3rd order and they always deliver way before the due date. Also the items fit perfectly and the quality is very good. Especially their bedding. They keep me updated though out the process and the parcels are neatly packed. Wil definitely refer anyone who wants to buy via SHEIN. I am sold.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have purchased several items from Shein and have had a great experience. The clothing measurements are accurate and they offer a wide range of clothing, accessories, etc.. Shipping has not skipped a beat."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like the return system, but a lot of products need better pictures. It would be nice if regular products and ""plus"" sizes were integrated as it doesn't seem the clothing is shaped to look better in the plus section."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The customer service is so slow, the executives are always busy. The app is a waste of time, there is no option to cancel the order even if it has not been shipped. When asked on how to cancel the order all they tell you is there is a cancel option when there is not. If you tell them that there is no option all they will tell you is that there is."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I has been regular shopper from shein . At times i do get money worth items but mostly the quality are not upto the standard of its price. Still then its a most convienent place to find very useful household items and clothing of any style one want it.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The search only allows you to find clothing not navigate the app. And often not very accurate or efficient. Not a deal breaker but would be helpful. As of july 18 regular error and not opening

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Really hard to see what all is there. ""ALL TOPS"" doesn't show you all of the tops, for example. You have to browse around. Sizing is incredibly inconsistent. Sometimes I'm a 3x, sometimes a 5x is 3 sizes too small."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this app!! I've been satisfied with every purchase I've made, the items are very good quality for a very affordable price. Thier baby clothes are top notch and their women's clothes are just beautiful! Plus the app is very easy to use AND they allow you to use Klarna for payments!! I love SHEIN!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love everything I've bought. Great quality, stylish plus sizing at reasonable prices. It was hard to get used to shopping online but with SHEINS easy return policy, it has made this tradition easier."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love everything about this company I especially love how cheap the clothes are but the quality is well worth what I would expect for cheap clothing and you don't have to pay shipping per item like you would on the wish app!! What you see is what you get and I also like that you can earn points on just about anything, saving them for a future purchas. I love that they have daily check IN to earn points. I also love that if you buy 57 items you can get points for each one, earing 15 to 20 points"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've been blown away by SheIn. The quality of all the products and clothing is very impressive especially for the price. Items come exactly as they are picture. I'll definitely keep using the app!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I had purchased an item before lockdown And I get my item delivered after lockdown I was not satisfied with my order so I really want to return it back and they have policy of returning item upto 15 days of delivery and I tried to return on the day when the item is delivered it was enable to return they were showing that your time has been over and most problematic thing is that there is no contact no. Active where customers can directly contact and tell their problems need to improve contac
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"They have so bad service. I ordered 2 items at the time, but received only one. They say it seems like you received your order already, just kindly click ""confirm delivery."" They haven't solved my issue. I wouldn't recommend !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,My first time experience was excellent. They deliverd on time but now since they are using aramax i am not happy at all.🚮i haven't received my order yet and now you are telling me about an insufficient address or phone number how the hell did you deliver the previous order. 😠😠you are telling me to contact my local courier before you return my order to the sender.🚮😠
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great app for some very nice clothing. I asked a couple years back if they could possibly sell 18 - 20 and I think they did start selling one of the sizes if not both. I've ordered several items over the past year or so and love everything item I've bought. Definitely recommend 👌👍
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shein has a lot of options, styles, and diversity. I think that most things are true to size /or picture. I wish that they had more options for the phone cases. I personally have a Google pixel, and have a hard time finding suitable cases for my phone."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is fun and has alot of options n choices for everyone. I enjoy shopping and browsing. It's very explanatory for buying and using your points while checking out. Love that they have my size too!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Some great items for a decent price. Some items are not the greatest quality, but the return process is simple and painless... Make sure to read the reviews on the items! Overall I love it!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I had heard bad comments about it so I was sceptical at first. Gave it a try and I was not disappointed. Quality is good for what the prices so I'm quiet happy to buy clothes for me and my little girlies at least once a month. Delivery from Evri is fast as well. Wish it was always free delivery from £9.99 as sometimes I just want a thing or two and dont want to pay delivery fee for something cheap. Haven't tried to return anything yet, which it scares me a bit but when I do I'll find out."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've been ordering from Shein for a while now. All and all I've been happy with my purchases. Shipping and delivery is usually pretty quick and I'm usually pretty happy with the quality of the material of the items I ordered. I believed I experienced maybe one or two times that I should have ordered a slightly bigger size and only once was the material different from what it appeared in the picture but it was still cute and wearable and for the awesome low prices you pay can't complain to much.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The first time I ordered from Shein I wasn't sure about sizing so I ended up sending about half of it back but they were so wonderful about returns that I felt confident in ordering again and again. The app gets to know your style and then they have pop up suggestions of like items for you to choose from!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This shein is the worst company that i have ever bought stuff off of having coupons are worthless cause they will make up something to just add to your bill. My bill was $119.00 and when i used my points and my coupon for $20.00s off they just added that much more on my bill instead of taking that much off of my bill
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've only used this app ONCE, and that is all it took for me to be disappointed. One of the products was NOT delivered amongst the many I had ordered. I have tried finding help but this app makes it IMPOSSIBLE to get any help. I made a complaint weeks ago, and have yet to receive any email or feedback on app. I'm very disappointed!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"At first I was sketchy about it, because it seemed too good to be true, but after ordering stuff I fell in looooove with this store & app itself. Everything is easy to find, arrives when it should, and in great condition. So far, no complaints!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's a reliable app it has cute clothes and accessories for home gaming kids and pets. It's definitely a addictive site to buy from for buy things for an affordable price. It has a shipping tracker so you can get updates about your items. And returns are a thing as well if you dont like it so they it out it doesn't hurt.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Good wide choice of clothing with quality durable material priced well. Love this app! Would be better if more stock was available from UK store to make shipping time faster but still not bad considering where they are shipped from.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Worst customer service. All they have in their hand is, we are sorry and we have noted it down but no resolution. I have already paid for my product, but its still not delivered. The delivery guy keeps rescheduling everytime. But shein customer care can do nothing . If u chat with customer care multiple times for status they will block chat as well. Pathetic experience."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's fun, and exciting all at once, you can have a variety of items all In one app. I would recommend this app to anyone, because it caters for all sizes of people, fat , fine , big boned , teenagers , children , boy , girl , man , or woman . The clothing prices caters for everyone . Beautiful dresses , shirts , active ware , home appliances , facials, nails etc can be bought at affordable prices . The delivery services is very very very efficient . The check out process is also very very safe"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Top quality! Insane prices. Don't shop instore anymore! People who are on the fence just try it you always have refund option for peace of mind. I have bought over 100 items and returned 5 items and it was so simple to do!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Delivery sucks. Shein needs to find a better deliver services or start thinking about scaling by having their own deliver service where their clients will actually receive their purchase timely, and not having to pick up their own package because the vendor and shipment, 3rd party they use are too lazy or aren't doing their job. I will not be purchasing again from this site. This is the 2nd time, and no 3rd time is not a worth my money or time. Failed me twice shame on them."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have to say, this is one of the best shopping apps I have ever encountered, there's alot of good stuff in here and I found new styles from this app that are super iconic~ this fashion app is one of the best and I have earned 3 coupons already from SHEIN. I would recommend ordering from this app you'll find great fashion clothing and ur exact style. ( hearts for shein ) ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I use the app for shopping with Shein more and more. It is so convenient to use. I have become accustomed to the way it works and found it easier than I at first thought. So in my opinion the clothes and items offered are good The app is easy to use to order and pay with. I am now enjoying it more. As to some niggles I now find it has improved.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The clothes are questionable sometimes, and sometimes so are the sizes. But the customer service, top notch. I had an order that was stuck at FedEx, and long story short FedEx lied to me 3 times on the phone, telling me my package was still at the warehouse. When I contacted Shein, they refunded me the full amount that day, I got most of the items I had ordered previously and my package arrived a week early."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great app, easy to navigate. I have never had an issue with ordering from shein. Clothes have been good quality for the price you pay. Have returned a few items and process was quick and refund given swiftly."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great quality clothes, low prices. Check sizing for each piece and it's nearly always perfect! Shipping is a bit of a wait but the estimated time of arrival is accurate."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love SheIn!! It is my favorite place to shop and to be honest SheIn is where I buy all my clothes from nowadays, no need to go elsewhere...They get that bigger gals also want clothing that's in style/fashion, you don't have to be a size 8 or 10, SheIn has fashionable/stylish clothing for all shapes and sizes, from XS - 4XL which, in my opinion, is dope asf!! Oh and major bonus, for me anyways, SheIn has Afterpay as a payment option...OMG, right??? Yeah buddy!!! Winning with SheIn for sure!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is so useful. Great clothing and accessories. Even other things like stickers and pencil holders and etc. The only down side is that it takes about a week for everything to come. But other than that, it's a 10/10."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"SheIn has literally changed my life! 💜 I'm finding a style that is more true to myself, finding confidence I didn't know I could have, and the deals and prices are so SO much better than on Amazon prime. I've gotten so many super cute summer clothes, vacation clothes, leisure clothes, and dresses for fancy events--all from SheIn, all within the year and a half I've been using the app. I've never felt so cute and confident in my life! And I *love* getting ~risque~ clothes to tease my man with🖤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Amazing, love when they put deals! I have gotten some of their products and I am not disappointed with the material and it's the exact design as seen on the pictures. Just be careful with the size you choose."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love the clothes I have purchased so far. I placed my second order but this time went down a size. My 1st order I went up a size as I assumed everything would run small but actually true to size! Plus I pay in 3 payments through afterpay a bug bonus!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Would give zero stars if I could. Product quality, tracking, sizing all awful. Customer service is non-existent. Literally. Nothing but bots. They claim you can do live chat but it doesn't exist. I was refunded for the wrong order, a loss of nearly $50 and no one to help me. I saved my UPS store receipt which shows which QR code was scanned for the return. So, I know I didn't make a mistake. They did. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY. YOU WILL LOSE MONEY AND SANITY. *they give the same response, BOTS"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love this company . They offer minigames to win coupons or points to put towards your account. With my experience of using shein for about 2 years now, theyve never hacked my socials which seems to be a common theme going around. My friends who have used shein also havent been hacked either. Idk. But you have to read reviews to understand what's a hit or miss and usually it's a hit. hope this helps !"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This app is amazing it has free coupons and no ads I have no bad experience yet. The quality to the stuff they sell is just awesome. And the jewelry is the best and clothes. You can buy shoes that would be about 90$ is only about 25$-30$ and the app never really lags or malfunctions. 100% try this app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Shein is so so so good!!! I just have one complaint about, the shipping, I bought a 31 cent ring, which i thought was great, But after i bought it, it came to 31 cents plus tax which somehow was a dollar but thats fine, it came to 10 dollars because of shipping my anger about it was that i spent ten dollars on a ring that was less than half a dollar. Im sorry for the bad reveiw but i gave 4 stars Because everything is pretty good quality and short Wait for stuff i bought But not good estimation"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Fun, everything is inexpensive and made of good quality! They have liveo videos every so often, where you can see a model and they tell you their size (you can get an idea about the outfit that they are wearing). They go through everything...like, is it comfortable? Should you wash it? How much? If I ever need to ask a question, they print instructions and help you in out personally (NO BOTS) . They always reward you with a good coupon. Shein has a reward system using points. Check in daily!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,its a great app honestly the shipping is fast if you dont update that something was delivered or not they will actually call you to make sure that it was the material is amazing the sizing is accurate i just recommend measuring yourself to get the right dimensions of your body but if anything could change on the app I would chouse to change that when im looking for jeans or shirts or whatever i have to pick from womens or mens and sometimes i just want a tshirt and i wanna look at the variety
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Always love ordering from SHEIN because you always get what you have ordered never had a bad item... always true sizes and well made lovely materials... good value for money...app is very easy to use to buy and also for returning items not that I have had to return any items but my friend had to but she wasn't sure so I done it with her.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Fantastic clothing for great prices Absolutely love this app but the only problem Is the mini games for example the card flip when I have the required amount of diamonds I click to flip the cards but then it says there is a problem and dose not give me anything at all and takes my diamonds away is there any way some one can help me on that ?
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm impressed! The app works very well, the clothes are AMAZING prices, shipping is supposed to be quick (I will update after arrival), it was fun choosing the clothing.. it's quite possible that if the shipping comes as quick as they said he's going to come but I'm going to be quite busy on this app. 😆 Yay clothes!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein has the BEST clothing for the most affordable prices. I was happier with my purchases from Shein than I have been ever with any other online store. Shipping does take about a month.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,By design if your app is downloaded in New Zealand then it should reflect those of New Zealand dollars not of American dollars. What about having points in 💷 Pounds for UK users fact that the money is more and should sit well the on anyplatform Also think about putting up a plus size app differently having to click on sommat and its on availability is up to size 12. Thank you for listening 🇬🇧 💷
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Shein are the only online shopping experience for myself The sizing is perfect and comfortable to wear. The pricing suits my budget and the styles are designed for those of us with a fuller figure. We don't have to look drab with exclusive designs from Shein
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Cheap Quality clothing. Average $5-$20 a garment with a lot at $10 or less after promos, and I'm talking about things that look like the $50-$100 price range. I rarely write reviews and only do so when it's legit, that good, or that bad."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Disappointed. Prices are too high, also it's kind of annoying that the same products are more expensive (almost double) in Morocco than most other countries. So disappointed not gonna purchase ever again. You just lost a customer."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app itself is fine, the only thing I find frustrating is that I am required to pay any duty and taxes at the border. The items aren't that different from Amazon or even wish and I don't have to pay duty when I buy from those sites, the prices are almost the same too."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love this app. Buying isn't complicated. The app is smooth to use. Shipping is fast and their goods are nice and beautiful. In Germany, returning goods are free. What I don't get is why the clothes and sheos on the site in Germany is expensive than that in Belgium. The clothes are almost 5 to 15 euros expensive than in Belgium. Why?"

My order apparently got flagged by the ""risk prevention system"" I was then sent an email to verify who I was by taking a picture of the last four numbers of the card I used to pay and a drivers license. Which I thought was quite sketchy so I cancled my order. DO NOT hand over sensitive information over email!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Horrible experience. They take way more time to deliver. The after delivery support service/return refund is horrible. They even charge you for customs and they don't even show them in the bill. The sizes are wierd.

I always used to think that i got cheap clothes from this app but to be honest I was just fooling myself cause the washing quality of the clothes is so bad that after 5-6 wash it looks like a year old clothes. It becomes loose, thin etc. And now even the price are not so cheap as well you could rather add few more money and could buy branded. Waste of money."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,A very nice app. Has the most importent stuff in mind: 1.So many different types of producets . 2. Cheap prices. 3.A very interactive platform for reveues and picture sharing of the products in person- big win! Will recomend
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I'm so addicted to this app! I find myself always in here shopping for my nexr order.

I paid for my order already through card and I don't know why there's a delay for more than 2 weeks. I never could have imagine that SheIn can act in this manner. Worst experience ever. I would not even give a 1 star if it was possible. SheIn is just the worst place to order for your items."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I brought a pair of pants that did not fit (they were too small and they didn't even have the same pants for the curvy/ pl lus size section) so I returned the item and the refund process was completed but I didn't not receive an option to get a Return shipping label so now I cannot return the pant that a bought. Customer service is not answering my specific question.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"its great for cheap and good quality, there are plenty of options available if your a tomboy fashion freak, basic white girl.. or a nice athletic outfit but I would DEFINITELY recommend looking at the reviews first if not you might get bad quality clothes."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is exceptional. It provides updates on new arrivals and out of stock. I recieved my first order today. I am well pleased with my purchase. All items fit great. One could have one size lower, but i can work with it. I am 6 ft tall, so the clothes fit comfortably. I am pleased."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Great value. Easy returns. Fairly fast delivery ....for covid time anyway. Good quality for price. Huge selection. New stuff all the time. And a vast array of style.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS APP! I am 15, and like all teens my age, I am VERY broke, Shein has great prices, as well as trendy clothing! There is definitely something for everyone. Not only that, but you also get to design your own outfits AND enter them in to win credits, which you can later use to buy products! Again, I just love it!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great online shop, cheap and good quality, does not take long to deliver either, I shop all the time on this app, and the more you shop the more points you get the more % you get off your order. Plus you can win competition and follow the latest trends. Love love love it"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,One of the only places that I can find close that fit but the inconsistencies in the material and the sizing can be difficult to navigate. I always recommend reading the reviews and knowing your measurements before you buy! Super fast shipping and some of my favorite pieces are from here!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Received a lot of great items from shein. It's always worth reading the reviews on quality and sizing first though. I find returns and refunds easy and straightforward. Would definitely recommend if you need to shop on a budget
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I enjoy window shopping even bought some clothing and am waiting for them to arrive, from other reviews u am genuinely excited to see what they are like. The app itself is great, very easy to maneuver and get to what you are looking for."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very good app with lots and lots to buy. The prices are good and competitive. You can even buy stationery which is beautiful! Brought lots before Christmas and will continue to do so!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I don't always review apps but when I do it's because they're amazing. The shein app itself is extremely easy to use and convenient. The clothes are also lovely, I haven't purchased one item that I wasn't extremely satisfied with"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Cheap, fashionable clothes. Delivery usually within 2 weeks on the east coast. Been ordering from them for a couple years, never had a problem. Best thing is the size guide, because I never have to worry or wonder if something will fit, it's all based on your measurements. My friend is addicted to this app now too."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I am obsessed!! At first I was a bit stubborn, then one of my beasties showed me what she got, and DANG ARE THEY LEGGIT. They actually give you what it looks like for cheap! While other places / websites sell for more. (For instance, a shirt, usually 15-50 bucks right? NO THEY SELL FOR 5-10!! THATS HOW GOOD IT IS!! unless it's like a wedding or something special, but you know what I mean for just a regular shirt or jeans)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'd u read reviews before purchasing they are great , I have gotten items not sown correctly and do need to take photos to show them , which SheIn also has a points system for people who are hooked ,like me. This site has lots of items for adults , children ,males and female clothing. Just always look at reviews!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love everything my daughters and I get from shein. My 14 started buying stuff a year ago. I figured it was another cheap material clothing app. but I was wronge and im hooked!!! Out of at least 30 things we have purchased, we returned 1 item. And that was only because the item was ""too girlie"" for my girlie kid lol."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great app for clothes. Various styles and great prices. The clothes are decent quality. I was a bit apprehensive to buy things at first thinking it would be like Wish but strictly for clothes because the prices were so low but it isn't. Very pleased with all of my purchases.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"There are FAR TOO MANY sexually revealing dresses, tops, under clothing, etc., while browsing. Why can't those articles of clothing be in a separate area? Many times my 4 year old daughter will sit with me while we go shopping. I use Shein because I love the quality of their clothing! Prices for the women's clothing are very practical!! Its hard to leave the site under $100! The men's clothing tho is not priced well. Please do something about the men's prices and the revealing clothes."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Stuff is very ok. Even what looks good on the site when u buy it n see it in actual the fabric is always not upto the mark. Unfortunately we have to pay for the return shipping for fabric quality that u can never figure when seeing it on the app and only when its bought u realise the quality.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"10/10 would 100% recommend. The duties on imports are cheap, the clothing is really great value for money and the service is awesome. Refunds are actually fully processed, orders arrive early and in good condition, sizing is almost always perfect. I'm never buying clothes anywhere else ever again 😂❤️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,My absolute favorite place to order stuff from!! I have been getting clothes and shoes from Shein for a couple years now and I've only got one item that didn't fit properly. Love the various styles and so many options! My favorite online store EVER
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I don't like that I have 2 orders from a month ago that I ordered and haven't received. I didn't know it was items from overseas. I am very disappointed. All my other items have came in a timely manner. The customer should have the option of knowing if something they ordered is coming from overseas. I ordered them for a trip and haven't received them on time.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app works well, and I've enjoyed using it. Areas to improve: (1) making it easier to return or exchange items [similar to Amazon], (2) enabling people to follow up on the delivery of items missing from the package received."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app overall is user friendly and great notification system for points. The company however takes a long to process orders, and I've had a few parcels that had to get re-shipped (currently been about 6 weeks and still waiting)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"All I can say. I enjoy this app.. items not all good quality but it's helpful so far.. I just have problem about my orders coz they didnt delivered it to me..I pick it up from their office. My 1st order they deliver but my 2 3 4 I pick it up..I spend a lot of money to rent a karim to pick my items.. what is the used for the COD pay?? So hard to explain them coz no one understand and speak English their.. so please change it, deliver it to me.. my orders it's all big amount. I feel disappointed😕"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've never had a bad experience except you have to read everything! You need to read the materials that the Garment is made from number one! Do not buy 100% polyester that was it that the cheap fabric going back to the 60's!!!!!just like you would not cook with 1ingrediant, same with fashion!!&#2READ the SIZES, in depth!!!#3 know your body.No1else sees it or will know if that's how you want it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Every I buy is worth. Make sure to do your homework otherwise you will be disappointed. Check the material up close in photos and descriptions and always read the reviews and try an match sizing to similar body types in photos. You won't regret it.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I have finally found an app that has my style of clothing. I loved the clothing options and they great prices you can get them for. The only small thing is that it takes quite a while to ship but overall great app!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My absolute favourite place to shop. The sizes are Amazing!! Upto a size 4XL - CONSISTENTLY! Across thousands of items!!! I mean - who does that🤷🏾‍♀️. And don't get me started on the homewear! I can wait to move, the whole house is going to be floor to ceiling in SHEIN & IKEA. The quality of Everything is on point, returning stuff is super easy and the fact that they do Klarna has changed the whole shopping game for me.The customer service is too lovely and fast acting.Love You SHEIN thanks x"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Honestly amazing the qualitywhen it gets delivered sometimes meh... not the absolute best but overall this app is amazing. If there were ways to create contests or competitions on the app for point ls Honestly it would be very fabulous and the app users will love it
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I just got my order(like 2 to 3 weeks early I might add!!!) I seriously don't know how the prices are so cheap. I am in love with my order and everything I got and I'm getting on to leave a review then going to order more lol. This is by far the best online clothes shopping experience I've ever had. Thank you Shein for coming through. I'm literally SPEECHLESS(which is rare) lol
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Shein used to be good until they increased the prices in a crazy way, I was buying handbag sets for 24$ (they shouldn't be more for their quality) they increased the price to 48$, I used to make monthly shopping from Shein for more than 500$, but I stopped doing that since they started to greed and increased the prices for their standard to low quality products and clothes which almost 95% or more of them are made of Polyester and cheap materials, I was here for reasonable prices but not anymore"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love the quality and design off the clothes. Im addicted to Shein. Wish I had tried it ages ago! Never received any thing that is of poor quality.. every thing is perfect.. even the sizes. Every month I treat myself and family to new clothes!! I love the points system, although just lately I don't receive as many as I used to... And returns are so easy. And refunds come through quickly.. Not that I've had to return much, just a couple of items in the last 12 months.. love it! ❤️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Absolutely love your clothes but your customer service SUUUUUCKS! I had a package delivered to the wrong address & because it shows as delivered I'm still responsible for paying for it? I can't get anyone on the phone & email communication is pointless. You'll end up losing me to Fashion Nova....if this isn't handled. They've been texting me everyday for months anyway 🤷🏾‍♀️
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I can't say enough about this website. If you're plus-size and have trouble finding cute clothes and fancy dresses, they have them! TBH it's changed my life. Instead of fretting over where I'd even begin to find something for my son's upcoming wedding, I had my choice of dresses. The evening bag I got to go with it is absolutely gorgeous. I've gotten lots of cute tops and sunglasses from here also. Once I got a watch that was scuffed, and when I contacted them they immediately took care of it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Their customer service is deplorable they sent me a whole bunch of clothes that I did order that did not meet their own size chart. Everything is extremely too small. If they choose to give you a response they don't give you enough information as to how to return the product. It is been a horrible experience they refused to contact you back.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"LOVE THIS APP! the clothes are SO cute and so cheap! Women's, men's and children's clothes, bathing suits, purses, jewelry, makeup, accessories, shoes, lingerie, etc etc! Plus they always have sales and coupons you can use. Definitely recommend!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Delivery was quick and esteem Shein for their efficiency. Most of jewelery bought are fantastic and get so many compliments. Only Earrings that looked so attractive on sight, were extremely small, suitable for children, even though, I got compliments. So far I received 4 orders and amazed how quick and efficient SHEIN are. I placed another order this morning. In my last delivery, I Received sofa covers, really beautiful. Got so many compliments from my friends. Thanks Shein keep it up."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Deliveries always turn up on time, in fact mostly before the estimated date. Everything I've had has been great quality so far. I think Shein may become my new fave place to shop! The fact that you can add boards like on Pintrest makes getting back to the things you like so much easier, as you can categorise everything. And they accept Klarna or Clearpay so you can pay in installments. Really, what's not to love about Shein?!?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love that it has EVERYTHING you could ever want, however I think they could offer things with a higher quality, some things are OK but some others are not good and you just realize that after you have used it for a couple of times. Moreover, I don't support consumerism xD so don't get yourselves carried away with the marketing"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Shein is an affordable and has a variety of fashions to suit different tastes. However some of the clothing quality can be questionable if you're not searching for a specific material. Otherwise the quality is great.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Hi, First I would like to start by saying that I love shopping here. I just wish that there was more out the box designs for Plus Size Clothes, Shoes and Jewelry. I say this because when you look at the other women's line you can see that there's a very big variety. Like I said at the beginning I really do like shopping hear, I just would like more of a variety to pick from. P.S. If you would need help with that please feel free to reach out. 🌺"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Cheaper and fast shipping. Shein have almost everything Amazon have but cheaper prices. Shein don't take so much money out like Amazon does. Lots of awesome things, somethings work some don't. Always make sure to read reviews, some are helpful some are not. Needy people ask for points their always broke😄. I highly recommend Shein😉👌"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I adore this app! It's really easy to navigate, its got plenty of deals, its affordable, and it's full of cute clothes (and housewares) for the whole family. I think the best thing about this app is that it's got ADORABLE plus sized clothing!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"If you are a shopaholic, reconsider before downloading. SHEIN brings out something dark and ravenous in me. They have all the cute styles for every size and I've gone ham. Not to be dramatic, but I love this store so much and it honestly changed my life getting to wear clothes I thought I was too big for."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Fabulous options & choices available, vouchers & sale prices amazing .. Fast & efficient delivery & updates - tracking....reviews brill, they help & advise on the item's your considering ...return options brilliant too...No bad experiences to date...Shein is my new best friend & obsession...keep up the excellant service ..👏"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have just received my first order from Shein and I am very happy with all four items I ordered. The picture & descriptions of my items were accurate. The colors were accurate. The quality was better than expected.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Always order from Shien very reliable and super easy when it comes to returns etc. Using the app made experience even more easier with Google pay on android and not having to enter any details anymore just a couple of fingerprint scans.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I loved shein app so much. I wish you would have more xs sizes for the sportswear, swimsuits, undergarments and dress aswell. please release more for the petite women esp the sportswear please.. i hope for more pieces for petite like me, like us. Thank you so much Shein, i will be a forever regular customert that's for sure. Im giving 4stars for now due to lack of xs size with sportswear and other mentioned above. Ill edit it to 5stars when you guys releases more for petite ones. Thank you."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My first orders arrived and wow i super likedit.. the quality and material is very nice and sturdy. But my 2nd purchase, i knda disappointed..bec it looks like the materials and how the dress was made looked cheap nad thin..idk what happened..and the accessories..they sont packwd it well, some my my orders were damaged bec they justput everything together. So maybe i will not order for awhile.."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I absolutely love love this app! They have a huge style of clothes with amazing prices!! They are true to sizes! With a huge selection!! It does take sometime to get to you but it is totally worth the wait!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Shein always has my back. They have great quality clothing USUALLY! And they have a great variety of clothing that you can get. It has an amazing price on mostly everything in their shop too which is always great so yeah. I mean that's all I don't know how to really write a review so um yeah that's all I have to say lol.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It depends on What you buy, but I really liked the Manual service chat of Shein, they are calm and humble plus they do their work immedietely, as per as the clothes are concerned, it really depends on what you buy, if you compare it with Zaful it is cheap, if you compare it with Club Factory and Rommwe it is a bit expensive. Rest material is fine but some clothes are very very wierdly bad. I prefer watching reviews and then ordering is the best."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I just love Shein and when I think of buying clothing, I head to Shein. All products I received was more than expected in terms of quality, sizing and comfortablility. They have also much options to choose from. You can easily spend upto and hour shopping from Shein. I personally feel that they should reduce their prices on fashion as I felt they are a little expensive. I've also ordered a lot of kitchen and home items and all of them were perfect. Delivery in some 8 days. I recommened shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,So far I have used it about a year now and its not too bad. I have a great experience every time I get a new wardrobe for myself and my babies. I haven't gotten other stuff besides clothes and jewelry. But I am curious about their household stuff. Will defintely continue using their products. The materials are getting alot better on the clothes.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So far, every clothing item I have purchased has fit to the correct size and the quality of material is not cheap! The swim suits are well made and thick material. Jeans fit awesome and are so comfortable. I just bought my man $80 worth of outfits for our vacation that is coming soon. I love that I don't have to wait a month or longer for my orders like I have had to do with other shopping apps. I get my stuff in about a week or so. Worth every penny and I will be buying more over time. Lol"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Absolutely love it! I'm a bigger girl and have trouble buying clothes online and in different stores. Bit this was exactly I needed. Their prices are also great with a large variety of affordable clothes and shoes.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"very affordable clothing, super cute, ships from the US. if you like 'wish' but are tired of getting ripped off or getting low quality, this is the clothing/accessory app for you!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,SHEIN is a wonderful app with endless amounts of clothes to shop from! I personally love this app and all the clothes I get from it. Everything is reasonable and they have a good variety things not just clothes. Their clothes are always really cute too!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Awesome I love this app, their clothing style are great. It is easy to order thru their app and the price are affordable. They also have coupons if you met the target price range for it and it will less on your total amount. Shipping is free for orders above P500+"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm so glad my granddaughter and Niece exposed me to Shein! My favorite place to shop now!. Its the only online clothes place that I don't have to guess my size or have to return stuff over and over. Most of the comments guides you how they fit, what the feel is like, if anything runs big or small for my size it's great! Everything I've gotten is beautiful and well put together. The clothes hold up nicely thru wash and wear. Only con is the chemicals they use to make them soft. So far no issues"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very good webshop. The system to get points by rating your bought items is great. It creates very accurate ratings from other users. So you know how it looks in real life without the hassle of hoping it will be good quality. Very very good.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,So easy and convenient. My first time doing online shopping from an international company. Love the reviews and item sizes it helps alot. Payments are done safely and easily. Still waiting on my 2 orders. Only downside is having to pay import tax if Shein can lessen that i will d a daily shopper lol.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Must admit I was very skeptical about ordering from another Web store however I am so happy I did! My order came in fair Delivery time! Now for the products although with any store or clothing when ordering for the 1st time your kind of guessing and hoping you order correctly in my case just about my whole order which was 12pcs was to big, I don't like chatting when taking care of business but my chat rep was very patient and pleasant they had NO problem with returning or exchanging my items."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I love everything about the app, the problem started when my last purchase didn't minus the 10% voucher I had. I tried contacting you via you app and I tried contacting you via Instagram but I didn't get any help. And one of my friends told me she claimed her tariff charges, but when I asked via Instagram I was told it is not possible. I honestly feel like deleting the app now"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I've never had any type of issue with SHEIN. I have a few medical issues that cause me to really fluctuate in weight so clothing gets expensive. I love the price ranges they offer for everything. Always check reviews of items you are buying because that can help your decision.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love this app.. Affordable and i love the huge range of clothing and home accessories i always check reviews before purchasing.. I recommend doing that for reducing any inconvenience most of the items are of great quality too.. I love that you can purchase gift cards and save so much like u can purchase a $200 worth purchase with a $175 gift card ❤️
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app. A good portion of the the goods are pretty good quality for it all being so cheap. I'd recommend it to anyone who can't afford Amazon or anything else like that, I recently spent less money on more items than I have in a while."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love Shein and the products and clothes they sell great quality. Even customer service is good and quick to respond never fails and what you order is exactly what you see in the pictures. I've only been ordering from shein 1 month and I'm happy with everything do read reviews before ordering.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love the low pricing and everything arrives fast considering the location! Everything I order is always accounted for. There are never any missing or damaged items and the quality is great!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very Good, Well-Trusted and Reputable Company!!! I have Always Received my orders on time! And, they have a Large selection of Affordable Items to choose from. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because, their competitor ""TEMU"" Automatically gives their shopper's Free Shipping on ALL orders whereas, ""SheIn"" Does Not!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"this app overall works very well, the only issue that I have is sharing boards. every time I try to share a board, it never works on the other person's end. other than that, this is very easy to use and very simple :)"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent service, fast delivery. Both dresses I have ordered have fit perfectly, and the other items I have ordered have came in perfect condition . And all have looked like the pics."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Love the options and the app interface. But shipping takes forever and sometimes quality is meh. Shein should not let customers rate products until then I receive them bc most of their items have artificially inflated ratings from people who give five star ratings but have not yet gotten the items. Love the check in feature for points and that doing reviews gets points. I just wish reviews had a week delay or something so we got more honest reviews from people who have actually tried the product
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I GIVE 2 STAR FOR CLOTHING ITEM. Was Suppose to be a Coat. Was a thin material like a shirt/ with a lite furry liner. Not tempature safe. And it's way too big in arms length and wrist. Not happy but can't send it back cause I have no money to buy another right now and it's 34*. Degrees. So I am having to put 2 long sleeve shirts under this to keep barely warm. The air blows right thru it. I loved my crafts I ordered. But not this at all. Plus it's not a coat. It's a lightweight jacket.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app, sometimes it lags when loading pictures so that can be annoying. I do wish they would bring back filtering reviews based on color of product. I found that very helpful."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The number one place I go to get all my nail supplies. They are quick and always receive my order no more than 2 weeks time. Free shipping, discounts and payment plan makes this website the number 1 stop shop for me."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My experience with Shein is very good 👍🏽 They have good deals and it mostly delivers before the delivery date which is awesome. I recommend Shein to everyone. Order received on March 21, 2023. I ordered lots of earrings from shein and when they arrived, most of the pierced pins are bent almost broken because it was mailed in a bag instead of a box to protect it. I was a little disappointed."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is a great place to shop. I buy all my clothing from here now. The App is brilliant, I use it all the time now. You get points for signing in and you can even set reminder to tell you when something you have in your favourite list comes back in stock. In one word. Brilliant!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I ordered a black dress and returned it cause it was too light(seethrough) and I wanted it in blue colour, the delivery boy came on 30th October and its 17 November and I haven't got refund yet. My refund path was shein wallet and in the app it mentions that it takes 24 hours if u choose the path shein wallet. No one picks up the call, services are so poor. I need my refund."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is literally retail crack man, u can't just get one hit. You'll go back for more and more and more. Their sales and true to sizing charts/clothes has always been right. Their items are reasonable as true to sale even for kids/infants. It's a must app to have and shop. Clothing quality is durable as well. I give it A+++++ 💗💗"

Each time I order i receive it faster than expected and all items are perfectly according to the description of size, material. I recommended SHEIN 3 years ago tp lots of friends and we all use it often to purchase cool clothing."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I bought a haul here for the first time, at first I was so worried that the items will be far from what it is in the pictures uploaded but the items came out so gorgeous and I am so satisfied for its quality considering the price. Will surely order again here with Shein. Ahh and also, I love how generous they are with giving points and vouchers, love lots Shein, keep it up💙❤"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,It's been a month since I placed the order. It was returned to seller for some reason and I haven't received the refund til now. Customer service sucks! Not helpful at all. Worst experience ever with online shopping. The update on the app is delayed!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A great place to buy things, cheap, useful things. This app is amazing it has nearly anything. Shipping is fast ( most of your time). Coupons and points to make your shopping cheaper too. Very easy app to use."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is amazing and easy to use. The only issue is if you want to earn shein points you have to check in everyday and sometimes it doesnt send a reminder, but overall the app is so amazing!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Clothes ok and delivered on time, but be wary of buying jeans from this company, as they are not as described when you receive them, ordered some straight cut jeans, received skinny cut, which will only fit a child or someone with drain pipes for legs, app is very limited in it's use, you can't actually return anything from the app, that as to be done online."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I enjoy receiving my items from Shein. The service is good and the items arrive in easy to open packaging. Before purchasing I carefully read about each item. Therefore I have not been disappointed in anything I have purchased. Even my husband is happy with the kitchen items!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this SHEIN app there is so much detail and there is a lot of help finding things on items. Certain items allow you to even go into this little area and you can fill out you size of anything if it is not already shown on the sizes. So overall SHEIN is a very good app I have heard a lot of good reviews on this app. This is why I rate SHEIN five stars. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I love the shein. I do alot of shopping but with the high shipping charges I am very disappointed 😞 n not buying anything else from you anymore cos I can't afford. Wish if you guys reduce the shipping charges for sure I will start shopping again. I do yearly 10 to 12 shipments. But not anymore I guess. 😔😔😔
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Ordered a gift for someone and they shorted me some items and said it was the ""logistics"" facility's fault when they are the ones that pack the orders, they didn't give me a refund or even try to resolve my issue they kept trying to blame me or ""logistics"". I even contacted logistics and they said they only deliver the items. If you use this app be careful . Customer service is rude. I deleted my account right after."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"This is my first time ordered from this app company experience. My email said it's delivered, but I didn't receive it. Try to contact customer service. It's not easy to connect. Keep repeating robot text. Not helping at all. I would like to talk in person. Products?? I really don't know yet. I haven't received it. Will update if I get my stuff. Update.. Finally got my refund, after 2 weeks. Reordered after refund, Items are great 👍. This time, I got it with lost my items. So one star up."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Your delivery system in dubai is the worst , I was really impressed by the products on your website but with the kind of delivery service you have been tied up to , I would be thinking twice to order any stuff from your app, your customer care no one is picking up, I was out when the delivery executive(imile) came , we rescheduled on another day, he never turned up , never attended the call when I called 2 times and blocked watsapp, there is no way of contacting your customer service."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I LOVE their clothing and jewelery. It's very easy to track your purchases and you can even earn points. There are so many great deals. I really enjoy finding unique earrings on Shein. I'm totally addicted.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This company is a scam. They charge expedited fee for delivery and then they dont deliver. I ordered two dresses and extras for important event but my order didnt arrive. They had not sense of obligation to refund my money. They wanted me to wait 5 days to see if it arrives. Instead of immediately refunding.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Loved the app.... The dresses are just awesome..... They r specially suitable for occasions, ramp... Loved those outfits.... The check-in points will be so helpful at the time of purchasing... But still needs improvement... Sizes may vary... Purchase after reading reviews"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,1000s od notifications. Just had 3 notifications in the space of 5 mins. Checked my phone digital wellbeing and turns out yeasterday alone I had 73 notifications from Shein. Yes I know I can turn them off and I have but a little bit ridiculous.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app its excellent. Theres one suggestion i have and it is to sometimes pack orders in boxes when needed please. Not everything can be packed in a plastic bag and travel all the way over here to the uk xxxx
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Very bad experience from Shein. It has been 1.5 months that i ordered and my shippment is not delivered till date. Repeatedly i have been trying to contact the delivery person but no response. Also they themselves cancelled delivery marking i have asked fo cancel it. What a pathetic service and pathetic delivery system. Please close your app as soon as it's possible becoz of u can't satisfy your customer no need for any kind of app and false promises.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Really good app, nicely set up and layout is user friendly. I find the suggestions offered when I look at an item really helpful. Great discounts and points for reviews. Items good quality too."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Impossible to reach customer service. I bought an item that says ""eligible for return"" in the description but there's no way to return or exchange it. The chat ""bot"" says that I can't return the item because it's ""in transit"" yet I'm holding it in my hand😒 I emailed someone and received a response in Chinese. There is no phone number to call anyone, submitting a ticket for an email yields no response. But you get what you pay for, I guess?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I'm so glad that I can purchase clothes without any problems. Being plus sized finding stylish clothes was always a task, but not anymore. Anything you can think of shein has it, and it's really affordable. The only problem is the jewelry. Some were broken and faulty, but other than that, it's really pretty. Some of the material isn't durable, and some of the clothes aren't wearable, which is a downside"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Many options for plus size. Some stuff is hit and miss but in general you will find fun, cool options on clothing at inexpensive price. Shipping is usually quicker than expected, huge plus."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I have some hit and misses. Here is what I have learned go up one size in your shoes and clothing to get the perfect fit. They are Europian and Asian stores. U.S. sizes are larger and it won't fit correctly if you get the exact size you normally wear. I am going to Jamaica and found some cute inexpensive clthes for my wardrobe. I am not a small size woman but found a lot of nice and cute items. Try it for yourself
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I love Shein because it have a wide variety of items at affordable prices. You can view items easily because of the way the app is set up. Since it's my first time purchasing and I haven't received my items as yet I will give the app a 3 star
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Outstanding Quality and Choice. Shein isn't just womens clothes. It caters for men and children, household items, electrical items, Nail tech items. The quality is brilliant, returns are easy aswell. There is always sales on and discounts"

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The application is very user friendly. It is way to navigate. I have been using it for almost a year and so far I have yet to experience any problem. Nor have I had any issue or concern about it. So not only the products they offer is affordable, Shein makes it easy for everyone to get their favorite clothes. So thank you Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Till today, I am very satisfied with all my orders from Shein. They are exactly how you see it on the photos. The only thing I want to suggest is that they shoud try to produce more beautiful outfits in sizes 44-46. Also, try to put extra products in case they are finished. Thanks Shein for your designs and affordable prices ❤️💕"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I haven't had any discrepancies from them. The things I enjoy most are the fitting of the clothes and how well they adhere to my body. Their prices are wonderful and they have such a variety of style and design. Keep it coming because January is my birthday month, and I will be shopping online."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love shein! I am a plus size gal and took a chance on the clothing, and it turned out well. However, the clothing was a little big for me (I assumed it might because you just never know how they will fit). I truly wish there were more options for us curvy/plus size gals. But, will continue to order from this site."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've had an awesome shopping experience every time I have shopped at shein,over 20 times and the customer service is great. . There's a huge variety on offer and the plus section inclusiveness is out of this world.Theres also accessories children,men, babies' and also home decor.Theres a fantastic selection of all categories and styles available. There is shipping over$45 and sometimes there's no shipping. You can earn points by ordering and reviews that add up and can be taken off the orders ."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app, good and inclusive clothing, and affordable. I know that fast fashion is bad, but as someone with low income that is plus sized, they have really nice clothes that I can actually afford."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I haven't had a bad experience with Shein. The range of clothes and other items is vast and good quality. The shipping is quick and the clothes are usually even better in person than the picture.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Just great ..great items . Too cheap yet the quality is really good . The fact thay i can see the item in pictures from previous buyers make huge difference. They have fast shipping and no hassle!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,PAID EXTRA FOR FAST DELIVERY Still haven't received my package and Halloween is today. I want a refund but it won't let me process it on the app. I want a response and my money back.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love Shein. Have only used them once recently and will definitely be using it more, was a little sceptical about them as most of the items are quite cheap, but so happy i took the chance, their cushion covers are top quality and jewelry is exceptional for the prices, bought a beautiful tapestry and to be honest, wasn't expecting it to be so awesome, love, love, love 🤩 delivery took around 3 wks, that is why i didn't give 5 stars, but may have been covid related."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love it. Never disappointed items arrived before time most of the time around Christmas I'd say holidays it comes at the time it says it'll come but other than that items always arrive before the date that they tell you which I absolutely love just make sure when ordering items you read the reviews I've only been disappointed once because I did not read the review but other than that I will continue to shop at shein
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have had great experience with the app I like the new features of going live . This brand has change my sense when came to wearing clothes I love how current and trendy the curvy pieces are. This app is trouble in good way I get caught shopping all the time

"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The occasional rip off and scams are there as usual with any app, but if you are careful about what your buying they can become easy to avoid. Shein sells good threads, and most of the things i've bought are in decent or good quality. I think it's a pretty trusty app. Remember to always look for the reviews first though."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app looks too good to be true... But it's not!!!!! The clothes here are absolutely GORGEOUS, comfy, and even more beautiful in person!!!! Plus my shipping was lightning fast, I was so shocked! I've already ordered twice and I feel like my wardrobe got 100x prettier in just two orders!!! Thank you SHEIN for your beautiful clothes, awesome discounts and wonderful customer service! I've told all of my friends and family about this app because I love it SO much!!! I'm 100% hooked!!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Awesome clothes and the app works great compared to just shopping on the actual website. I don't buy clothes from any other site/app and not just nice/ work clothes. Comfy clothes,every day clothes, socks and undies, lingerie, accessories for hair and clothing, jewelry, makeup, spanks. Everything. and I've only made 2 returns out of over 100 purchases. Returns are so easy and free too. Less than 3 days after dropping my return at the post office, my money was refunded to my bank card. Impressed"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Love every experience with the app I've had so far. Should definitely put a spending limit per order though cus I can't stop 😂 everything I've gotten has been great quality so far. It's easy to explore and everything is mapped out to make it even better.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Its a very good app with a wide range of variety but alike other shopping apps it doesn't provide an easy expected date of delivery even after placing an order you don't get the delivery date and that makes me unhappy with this app,also the customer service is a bit tough to reach rather than other apps."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is all in one online store. I'm shopaholic and to buy things we have to go store to store, but at Shein? It's like an ocean of diamonds and pearls and precious gem. Best brand inspired items. Return and refund is easy. We get reward points and using points for shopping is so beneficial. Their wishlist category is so detailed, none in the market. 😍😍😍😍😍😍 Keep it up. Trendy fashion store eve n ever."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very nice app n collection. Kindly work on ur search field and key words. Once we view any bottom item frm the saved list it goes back at the top after viewing it. Thats it!!! Rest SHEIN Rocks!!! ✌👍
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love their clothes except for the hoodies and sweatshirts. They seem to collect dirt and you have to like peel it off But their stuff for summer is stunning and they're usually the size you are. I would definitely recommend them!! Now I'm a bit pissed with trying to load my comment They are trying to do a survey and that's fine but nothing working or it takes a long time. Not sure if this will ever be posted! Lol
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I like all the clothes i bought in Shein. Has a good quality and always the same on the picture. The size guide is very helpful in this app. I always check the guide because there are diff size in a every clothes you buy. They put the estimated date of arrival of your order, you can track them."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love the website ,quality ,everything. Just thats its a little pricey ,sales arent great, sometimes it takes really long to deliver and you usually have to buy 1.8k worth of products to be elgible for free delivery which is quite a hefty price."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Considering it's cheap, you get good stuff for the money you pay. Some cheap items are very unreliable but I also buy clothes from there and so far I am impressed. Of course though, the quality won't be great so don't heavily rely on shein"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've been ordering from Shein for over a year now. Dresses, underwear, tops, sweat shirts. Make up. Delivery in about a week, ive never had a late or missed delivery, all good quality products, amazing value, true to size. Love this site!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I know Shein is generally a model base fashion where your waist has to be a 34, -24, -34 but no one in reality is that slender. I'm not here to bash your models but what I would like is more variety for the thicker girls, the girls who have thick thighs but small waist, girls who have wide shoulders but no breasts, etc. I know you made double clothes, one for models and ones for +Sized women. You do have variety It would just be better if you had more for the improportionate girls."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The app is great, I've ordered items for my whole family. I just wish it were easier to find the curvy items in the actual available sizes when I set the filter to my size."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein customer service is excellent. Out of many orders from them, I've only had one issue (which was actually a mess up by DHL, shocking) and they immediately reshipped my package with free express shipping. As for the quality....just read the reviews and don't buy anything under $15 and you'll be alright."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent packaging and good quality. SHEIN is my new go to. The prices of their swim suits, jeans, blouses and even accessories are good for my wallet. You get a lot of bang for your buck. Definitely highly recommend. Update- 9-1-2022 I still LOVE my Shein! Now, I'm buying for my 15 yr old very tall son, my 17 yr old teen daughter (of course) and no my hubby has asked to jump in when we make a big order. Great website and amazing sales! Keep up the great work, Shein!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,I am writing the review based on my first order. The dress was exact same as shown. But the fabric was not upto the mark for such high price. The app's user interface is not much complex.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,DO NOT SLEEP ON SHEIN BECAUSE ITS BOMB. My kiddo and I have a whole new wardrobe now and it's all because of SHEIN & their affordable prices. I could even afford MORE THAN 1 PAIR OF SHOES AND HEELS. I can't afford a lot being a single mother and Shein made it all possible. They have different deals daily & always have some kind of sale going on. Not to mention the coupons and discount codes. You can also accumulate points to get $$ off. I love this budget-friendly site & You will to.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Very pathetic customer care service . I have ordered few things and i paid through debit card and while receiving ordering it is written that is cash on delivery. So double payment is done and i tried contacting customer care but there no option to contact . And they dont even provide a contact number to talk in person . Dont know how to get refund of my double payment .
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Shein has a lot of products. I have ordered a lot from them. Some good, some not so good. However, recently the products ordered have not arrived on time or not at all. Customer service is little to no help and still have not gotten refunded on some items shipped, but not received. It is to frustrating to deal with so buyer be aware."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Everything for everyone affordable I love Shein.If Shein keep improving I will never Bay in a store only ON Shein.I am happy with what I am seeing so far. Everything is worth the effort and in my budget, Except if I can say, I would love if you can have some more lovely women shoes at more affordable prices.Just a tip and jeens.The rest is Awsome.The free shipping amount can be made less, if I can only shop 3 items every month I have to spend so much every time on delivery fee."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,At first I thought this site was great. Ordered several times without any problems and was pleased with the clothing I purchased. The last two orders not so much. After 4 emails to customer service I finally received a response and my items came. This time around I've emailed 5 times.... still no response and still no package. According to the post office they're still waiting on the package themselves. Seems as if they hook you with the first couple of orders then just run games taking 💰
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I really love the outfit collections. There are categories of clothing for everyone which is the best thing about Shein. ☺ but It would be better if there are more varieties of kids as well because for short girls like me and my friends the biggest size of kids are sometimes the appropriate size😂
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely fell in love with shein it is super affordable and the materials are wonderful... I have told all my friends and family about it...

That being said, read reviews of each item you buy before buying it! Everything I got came to BC Canada within about 2 weeks. Will definitely be ordering again soon ☺️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was skeptical of shopping at first but with the reassurance from other woman who use it, I loved what they had to offer and now I shop for almost all my clothing and other stuff too now. Plus to be able to earn points while you shop it's a win win for both the customer and the vendors. I enjoy it more than I expected. I'm glad I heard of Shein."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love love love this app. It has great deals, one of a kind clothing you might not see in another store.

"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the designs and the affordability. As for the app, I like that there are so many categories in which to filter the items showing that I can get more specific items showing up on my screen."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein.... The only thing I don't like about your sizes when it comes to your solid halter tops is the way they fit. For some of us big busted girls they don't fit so well especially under the armpits so please just fix that. Other than that you GREAT 97% of the items are exactly as they are advertised & the quality is excellent. If they say it's leather it's just that, I love the delivery as well the courier company they use and so, I am happy and satisfied so far. Shein I love you.😘👌🏽"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I was recommended this app by my daughter and daughter-in-law. I have just start shopping and I received my items earlier than stated. They were both as they looked/described. I just wish my searches could be more specific.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Really good app for shopping and choosing what cloths you like by the filter option, I really like the cloths, good quality and good discounts. It has really helped me choose the type of cloths that i like and be more confident with myself."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,So far all the clothes I have received for myself I love and fit well. Good material and comfortable. The prices are very affordable and in some cases more than reasonable. Also they arrive in a timely manner that is expected. I love this site!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's such a convenient app. I am not very used to online payment and here all the products are available for COD so i am very happy with that (except they charge extra for COD though to promote online payment). There's a min payment amount to get free shipping though.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great quality clothing,looks expensive and deliveries are always on time!!You can't beat the prices either,it is a great app and I would recommend it to anyone looking for fashionable clothing,I love to shop here!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Excellent Customer Service!! They are quick to respond to any questions, concerns or issues. The clothes are cute and super affordable. Exchanges and returns are super easy as well!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"I love the app overall but I've been having issues with the shein points you save up over time. I had almost 11 dollars worth of shein points I've been saving up and I havent been missing any days, I come back today and I lost 3 dollars worth of points. Can these points expire after an amount of time? If so, why isn't there anything about points expiring in the rules?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Fashion is mind-blowing ...u will get every western wear here n the collection is awsosome but the prices are little bit high n delivery charges are extremely high like they charge u basic standard delivery fee then a minimal delivery guarantee fee n on top of that they also charge a cash on delivery charge. If u purchase in bulk then these costs reduces but its a bit difficult to buy a single product.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,It has amazing deals and it is not just clothing but one can also buy cute home decor or things for crafts. Update! I have lowered my stars from 5 stars to 3 stars becuase Shein is not letting me upload photos. No matter what I try it won't let me for reviews and makes me write my reviews all over again. I had the chance to get over 77 points but I couldn't because it wouldn't upload my photos. Including right now I am trying to resale an item and it won't upload at all which means I can't sell
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love this app. They have great styles for men women and children alike. One problem I did have was the support system was hard to navigate. Other than that I love it. Very trendy and fashionable clothes for every aesthetic 😘
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The App itself is absolutely easy to navigate! I have no complains about the app, my only issue is the delivery time but I love the items and the quality of the products hence the reason I keep ordering!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love shopping on the Shein App! My only problem is that the search bar only shows regular sized options automatically. If you're looking for something plus size, you must type in PLUS as well. Idk it's a minor thing. I love SHEIN!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Becoming very expensive, and quality is not marching in some of the clothes, especially .I bought a dress that I thought was good by the picture, but when arrived,I was a bit disappointed . Plus, returning the items is almost impossible . Rates are fake for me. If you can't rate their items.loads of dodgy things there . If they carry like this no matter how many customers they have today.Tomorrow is what matter better than today's."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Really love Shein!! They have such an amazing variety of everything and such budget friendly prices. Definitely a must try. Their clothes / accessories / homeware collection is huge you would want to order everything. For sure recommended.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Overall a great site, I love scrolling for new things and when ordering service wat perfect. I would have liked if there was an option to filter once personal favourite items."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love it!! I was a bit sceptical about ordering from here but I have been so impressed with the whole service, the app is brilliant, keeps you updated in delivery, you can earn points towards a discount. Its just fab. The clothes are good quality and good sizes, true to size."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Besides the cute stuff and so many choices for curvy women, the customer service is absolutely excellent. They have been so good from returns to a missing package. I give them props!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I just wish there wasn't randomly outfits not presented on a model. Being plus sized, I need to see the fit. Also many of the items aren't as nice quality as they appear, but overall pretty close."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Always delivers products which are WAY DIFFERENT than the ones which are shown. Clothes displayed have a good length but the clothes delivered are extremely cropped and of thin material. Disappointing!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The service is excellent: from navigating through the website to the checkout to the shipping and how they keep you updated to the delivery. And I love the ""point collection system."" The return system is a hassle free one if you have to return something that is returnable."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,can be slow loading some times and when you view an item in a section it doesn't take you back to the place before you viewed it (example is I'm viewing ladies tops and there is 300 items I get to item 25 click on it to view full details and pictures after II press the back button to return to continue viewing the other items and it takes me straight back to item number 1 not item 23 which is really annoying.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Everything looks rlly cute and decently priced, but I havent bought anything yet. I'll update when I do:) Edit: I love the clothing it's super cute! Somethings have super nice material and some are just okay but overall the style is what I love! The only thing I wish is that they had specific sizing for the kids."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Fantastic variety & colour of clothing in larger sizes and prices you can afford to stay looking trendy for all seasons. Bought a couple of pieces for the home and been very happy with those items too. Only thing I've found is some shoes and trainers a tad small compared to UK sizes. Payments, delivery and returns I have had no issues what so ever. Overal would highly recommend."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Really nice, quick, user friendly app. Out of all these online fashion outlets, shein is the one I consistently receive really nice quality, fashionable items. I have ordered heaps and the app seems really intelligent suggesting related items when I search. Love it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,It has been great. The services excellent shipping everything. I love the experience makes you feel apart of the shopping at a whole different level with the points.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Clothes look horrible not like on site poor quality. Wont refund your money.its been a month now. All items sent in one box. They refunded me for 2 dresses not all looking for tracking number they said. Its sad when these people get your money and hold it.now they closed my ticket but never refunded my money. Been back and forth with them they dont care. DONT ORDER FROM THEM. Send wrong items and never refund your money
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Havent had a real problem thus far.. Only unhappy with a few pcs..and that was a personal preference. Shipping is always on time or earlier. Never had to contact customer service...
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I never really was into online shopping but its hard to find clothes that fit for me as a plus figure in-stores so some of my friends suggested I shop on SHEIN and ever since I shopped with them I can't get enough there clothes are comfortable and affordable and everyday there is a sale and or deal and shipping is FREE to me its a win/win especially with the holidays.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Dont get any better the this app! I just love everything about Shein!!! Just make sure to check and read the reviews on the items that you want to buy!! Always Read The Reviews!! Don't buy anything unless you check the reviews out!! Thats the only thing negative i would say about Shein! If you don't read the reviews then you don't know if you should upsize or downsize for a clothing item! & some other items may not be what the size actually is of that item. Thats the only downside to Shein!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The app and the website mess up during checkout and remove half if not all of my items while trying to checkout and make me start shopping all over again. If it would properly save things and stop emptying my cart then I would give it a five star rating.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's probably the best shopping app out there, honestly speaking I haven't tried that many, but from my short experience it's been great. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is because there is some nudity on there or and a lot of nakedness, I wish there was a cencer option on there so I don't get flashed evertime I shop."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I like the collection but price of products is high as per expectations. I hate this app as they deliver products very late it take around 30 days to deliver products. There is no proper estimation date for delivering . The help centre is worst . They never solve the problem. Pathetic service.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,This is a great app for shopping. I just love the outfits. But the app has become very slow for which i am facing lot of problems during searching for outfits. Please kindly fix the problem. Otherwise for me it's the best shopping app.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Honestly I love shein. I'm plus sized and compared to other companies shein has a much larger range of plus size clothing that are actually cute instead of ugly floral or polka dot prints. I know people talk about how bad fast fashion is but 90% of clothing is manufactured in china so why pay 3x the price for clothes that were still manufactured there. Shein is a great place to get affordable clothing and decor.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Amazing products and super easy to navigate. You won't get better prices anywhere for the quality products that they offer.You can find almost anything there! I was pleasantly surprised. Try it! I guarantee you won't regret it.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Hooked my daughter in with ""free gift"" that disappeared becoming ""unavailable"" as soon as you get to ordering. Same thing happened on every ""gift"" I tried when I opened a new account as a referral. They may or may not send the actual goods when you order them, but their marketing should be punished not rewarded. Disgrace"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Generally all my parcels arrive within a month. But one of them have not arrived yet. When I tracked it down, it showed that it was shipped more than a month ago. After which there was no further movement. So, I contacted the customer service twice in the last 2 weeks and they Have Not Responded. I contacted my local delivery agencies and they haven't received any parcel with my name on it. I enjoyed purchasing from Shein but now I am missing a parcel. The customer service is too pathetic."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The items I ordered were unbelievable. The prices are awesome, kind of threw me though, I must admit. I figured at that price something had to be wrong with the clothes, not at all, the material is so comfortable. The fit was perfect(true to size.) I highly recommend!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Came here to review more appropriately after I had shopped with Shein. This place is unreal for girls clothes of all ages, I use Shein for all the girls in my family when it comes to clothing gifts (5+ girls to account for). Not only are their clothes affordable but they are great quality, well modeled and described too. I do find that the boys section can be a little whacky but to each their own. Combine Shein with Clearpay and you can pay it off for those budgeting. 5* store and app, great job"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I was hesitant to order from here because it was from China and the prices threw me off but I heard to just look at the reviews and I took a chance . I was pleasantly surprised when I got my order to say the least! Its easy app to use and I love all the clothes and items they offer!! Their prices are great
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,This app is great!! Sometimes what you purchase is a little on the worser side on quality but it mostly matches it's price :)) I'd say you have a 80-90% chance that the product will be great
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Great unusual things to buy and at amazing prices. For all the family!. Sizes accurately displayed for clothing and other items. Regular go to place. Great quality and design.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Yeah, not bad. Overall the sizing charts for bras is awful. Fix that and it will be better. Would like more close up images of the fabrics. Ability to narrow down from 'red' to burgundy, maroon, crimson, etc. would assist faceted navigation."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I don't know much about the app but all in all I recommend everyone to go shopping with SHEIN they have so many items with good quality at an affordable price, good service and quick delivery, free shipping at a reasonable amount . Thank you SHEIN for being real in all your products 💪💪💪"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the stuff although its a bit expensive but the quality of the product makes it worth...A bit of delivery issues that I have faced thrice,wherin we need to keep contacting and track the orders,no updates from the company's side makes it a bit problematic....otherwise products are superb..♥️♥️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Truthfully love the things i ordered my only complaint is their models make the clothes look different on them maybe some realistic bodied models for diffrent comparisons would be nice. But other then this i love the prive easy to use app and when you get your delivery they come in there own bags which i though was great :)
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein's products are quality,high class ...my daughter has struggled for the right size of her length for long ..Shein is doing is looking like her personal tailor on everything,she doesn't want to buy anywhere else besides Shein ...am always worried about the shipping and custom fee she pays BUT what she doesn't mind ... THANK YOU VERY MUCH SHEIN"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"At first I loved the site, I did buy 4 things and honestly I loved what I got, except that one of them was badly sewn, so I returned it. Now, I received the email that they received the returned item in March, we are in June now and I am still waiting for my refund. They is no customer service number or email that I could find to ask about my refund. If it was not for this, I would have given them five stars because I truly like the items I kept. But now I will hesitate to use the site again"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great deals👌 Big discounts, cheap shipping charge. Product details are all specified.Prices are reasonable. I love the designs of dresses, pants & shoes, always up to date👗👖👡👡 This is my 3rd time purchasing & will definitely order again😉"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Very bad experience, shipping is too long, waiting for a product since 2 months"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Amazing! I have always had so much trouble finding clothes for my body. Clothes that not only look great, but doesn't break the bank. A close friend of mine told me about Shein and I absolutely love it. I check it everyday to see the new styles and sales! It's been a long time since I've found clothes that make me feel both feminine and beautiful."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,There's no option to choose or know the courier beforehand at time of order. You cannot find this information out in the app or on the website. They used a local courier who left my package outside my office after 10:30PM on the weekend. My package was therefore stolen and SHEIN customer service told me to take it up with their courier before they did anything about it. Horrible customer service. Ended up getting my refund for the package their courier lost. So buyer beware.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The SHEIN mobile app is a great way to browse and purchase clothes from their online store. It is easy to use and has a great selection of styles for all genders. The prices are very affordable and the shipping is very fast. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone looking for affordable clothes!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Mostly great experience. Products have been great for the price and mostly of great quality. Only had one mishap where some cake toppers were not packaged properly and arrived broken. Otherwise, shopping on Shein has been great and I highly recommend. Just make sure you are reading the descriptions and take note of the reviews on the products you're intersted in. Can't go wrong!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing, Shein is amazing. The clothes are super cute and really affordable and they're reliable on quality cars long as you read the product reviews. They have coupons that increase in value as you spend more an order that says $187 will turn out to only be $150. It's a great app. Definitely recommend!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app makes it easier to shop in shein, and the app works really well. Shein is very affordable and trendy clothes, I love them, they give you points if you review them and do the things they ask to spend on your next order! I definitely reccomend this app (includes clothing/home/beauty/and lots more) and the store in general"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,The clothes are good quality and always a cheap price which I love. One thing I don't like is how the girls kids clothing has lots of crop tops and revealing clothes instead of actual appropriate clothing. One time my order didn't even come at all but I have ordered many many times and other orders came. Overall SHEIN is very nice.👌
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I really enjoy this app I've order lots of stuff on it and only was disappointed in maybe 2 items and only because it wassmt flattering to my body type. The return policy is really easy as well. I've recommended this app to many people and everyone is satisfied. Follow the measurements and read the reviews to find what works best for you!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Spent over 100 first time purchase. Decent selection,all clothes fit, delivery in reasonable time, app easy to use, give you loads of vouchers to start with and some came with delivery too. I don't give many things 5 stars but so far so good, no complaints. Would use again."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Had nothing but great experiences with this app! Love it. Excellent quality clothes for the prices they are. Also the customer service works so quickly. I reached out over two defected pieces and was issued a refund same day a few hours later. And when a parcel was 3 weeks late, I reached out over social media and was issued a refund same day with an apology! Best service."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love Shein. Their clothes are good quality and inexpensive, plus you can receive points for every purchase, which gives you a discount on your next one. Not to mention, other discounts are continuously available. <3"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,My experience with this app has been excellent. Everything is simple from finding your right size to payments methods and to adding a delivery address. I'm definitely going to order more from SHEIN.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love this app, so easy to use and order my stuff from shein, great clothes and items from there, occasionally put games on too so you can win extra points and I also love the points system where you can check in daily, warn points then take them points off your basket!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,So much better for those who dont have a ton of money. Joggers from here are sooo comfy and the quality of other clothes is great too. Orders usually come before the expected date too. The tracking is great too since you dont need to worry about where your items are constantly and they send updates on your favourite items of they restock which is handy..
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love love love all Shein. 6 months later, Still love em. But... I got my first disappointing order, almost late to boot. They sent me 3 of a waffle sweater that I never ordered. It looks nothing like the 1 that i did order. Sent me the wrong size dress and I repurchased a great bra I got a month or so ago and it was the worst put together p.o.s I've ever seen. Shein, don't disappoint us here in the great US of A! We have to take a loan out to buy a dress it would cost us 30 from u."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Having to wait half a month to recieve my items is not ok. The usps tracking # they give you is useless, because it sais they were notified to make a tracking # but haven't yet received the item or items. You go to the website and it sais its in transit. Which is the truth? I feel like I'm being scammed. Honestly just go to amazon or physically go to a store because there's several people who have had to experience this horrible service and it would just be best if no one else had to."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Love all their products, all such good quality, even the cheap clothes. Easy to get points and coupons. The only issue is their swimwear shrinking within first two wears. Everything else is amazing, love buying off here."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Wonderful app, you gotta pay for shipping, but it's not like 50$ shipping like some places, you can easily make orders under 10$ even with shipping! Love it! Don't forget to check in every day for coupons and points!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Easy to use, keeps you updated. The reviews with photos of realt people wearing clothes are really useful and the quality and fit has been brilliant. Way better than expected!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Much better than WISH!!! I was very skeptical about ordering clothing from Shein but they fit great and seem to be pretty good quality. Shipping was soo fast and I also got a few things for my home and again VERY impressed!! Their Sheglam makeup is as good as the high end stuff at Ulta and it lasts ALL DAY!! Give Shein a try you WILL love it I promise!!!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Worst app which I haven't seen till now... Producys quality is so cheap and even if place return pickup.. They will never pickup the order... They will automatically cancel the pickup stating that customer cancelled... All mallpractices... And customer service is very very worst
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I'm addicted!!! I've ordered soooo much stuff. Some things can run too big/small even after reading the reviews or going your measurements. My items sometimes come in a timely manner, come early or they may come late(del service fault). I recommend."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I was very sceptical about ordering from Shein for the first time, but there was no need. I thought the items may be a little cheap looking when they came, but I was pleasently surprised. I have ordered loads since and never had to send anything back so far! Great service and delivery too. If you're wondering whether to order, just do it! 😁👍🏻"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,There's alot of amazing items for awesome prices! I love the selection and how easily you can find what your looking for. Finally an app that you don't need a year to be able to figure out how it works. I can't say I've ordered yet but it's in the very near future!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Easy app, easy returns. Not the highest quality clothes, but they are worth the money and this company actually know how to fit plus size. Honestly a style for literally every person! Vegas stripper to old grandmas and everything inbetween can find something for them! Lol"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Easy to get nice plus size clothes from Shein that's not available anywhere else. Clothes are pretty affordable and good quality so it's worth it. The app is easy to use, and easy to get coupons and promotional deals."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It is a good app, but it would have been great if you also put on a lot of other phone model for phone cases because it's hard to buy phone casing when my phone model is unavailable in the apps. And also to the lanyard."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"My friend told Shein was good Also I saw positive reviews but doesn't seem so good for me. I ordered a pair of T-shirt and a pant, One tee looks different form what was shown and the pant that I ordered has ''No stretchy material'' written in the description but it is stretchy and aslo looks big unlike the picture. I think things are overpriced cause I'm ready to pay for that but I also want the material to be good"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The shipment process is horrible and takes way longer than the website says. I ordered off of the site December 3 under standard shipping because I needed some clothes to wear for my friends birthday party on December 21. I figured since her b-day was 17 days away, that would be more than enough time to deliver my package. Nope! 15 days later and my package has been stuck at the same local distribution center for 3 days. Mind you, my package doesn't have alot of items. I don't recommend."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Update: I have not been disappointed by anything I've purchased. From clothing to shoes to exercise equipment and a gaming headset, good quality, great price. Want sophisticated or kawaii? They got that. Want trendy or classic? They got that too. Shower curtain or a cute lamp? Yep they have that too. Love it! Great app! Easy to find exactly what I'm looking for!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I have not had any problems with order and delivery so far! App is easy to navigate and I usually get my orders early too. Quality is good for items that look great for a one time or occasional wear.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"So far so good, have made quite a few orders now, the quality of material is not always great,so need to double-check and always read reviews so you know what you are buying. But honestly a great place to shop and have had no issues so far, and I believe returning items, if required, is straightforward. also- one happy customer here !"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"It's a hit or miss. Some items received are exactly as pictured and great while others look nothing like the picture, and are poor quality. It makes it difficult to want to shop because you dont know what you're going to actually end up with."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"This app is great. Sometimes the sub-sections on the search are a bit, either too specific or a bit vague (I know that's contradictory) it depends on what you are searching for. Apart from that I LOVE it! I particularly love the real person reviews. Nice one Shein. 👍🏼"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,They cancel the order as per their convenience without any notification giving any stupid reason like product is out of stock even after choosing guaranteed shipping option. Once the order has been placed no site ever cancels the order saying product is out of stoçk. And vry poor customer service after all the inconvenience caused to customer.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I just received my first order and it arrived earlier than the estimated arrival date that I was given which is a plus 👍 (about 2weeks). The sizes fit well too. I'm usually a small but I ordered medium after reading the reviews. I would recommend that one reads the reviews on the item you want to purchase first. All in all I'm quite happy with my purchase and I will be purchasing again 😊👍👍👍. Dbn - South Africa.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Excellent app! I'm now an avid Shein customer! Have ordered three times so far and each dress has fit perfectly and delivery time is fast. My last order arrived within 7 days. Very happy. The only thing is not knowing how to turn off the notifications for ads.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The item that I ordered was packed with loose honey in it. Clothes were stained because of it, and when I tried to return the product these people are charging ₹65/- I guess this is the business model they are working on, ship the faulty item and let the courier company make profits. Sick of this app, sick of the product. Hated it, worst experience ever."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great site to navigate. Good quality clothes. Well packaged, fantastic prices, fast delivery...thanks. Each item is individually packaged in a ziplock bag within the larger parcel. All clothing has been accurate to the sizing charts. The clothes are good quality and hold their colour and shape when washed. I'm loving this site. It's convenient in these days of online purchasing. The prices are amazing and an absolute bargain. Considering where they are shipped from, they arrive quickly."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I like how you get points to use towards your purchase and also like how easy it is to return items. I appreciate people's feedback and pictures on items they have bought from SHEIN, It makes it easier for me to know more about the item. How it fits and feels."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"DO NOT USE! EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. Yes, I have spoken with customer service. It's their policy not to return or refund bras. Sizing is a disgrace and so is their customer service. I spent $247AUD on my first and last order. All bra cup sizes are small, doesn't matter if you buy XL. Also the shipping takes forever, I received other overseas orders quicker than this one. No refund, not even a partial refund or store credit. Not good enough. I WILL NEVER USE SHEIN AGAIN."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I love Shein to death! Most of my clothing and shoes are bought here but I'm curious why people are listing ridiculous prices on the new exchange program. It doesn't give much motivation to buy anything. Of course I'll still purchase the regular way but who is going to buy any of the exchange products if they are way overpriced?
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I think this app is awesome, the clothes and shoes are pretty much to size and at great prices. Some materials used on their garments should be looked at. For example in summer clothes the material is just wrong as it doesn't breath and makes u feel hotter and sweaty. This app gives some great incentives that I love. I will continue using this app"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I am pleased with the site and how fast the clothes arrived. They also look just like the picture. The only issue I have is that the sleeves to a set of pajamas I ordered are strangling my arms. I would love to wear them together, but if I had ordered a bigger size it would have been way to big everywhere else."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Quick delivery, cost is okay also there's variety. It helps you to find similar items very easily. It's more like one stop shopping almost all you need is available."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Literally... The bestest app I have ever wander. I am really obessed with shein.. The trends and clothing style is really great.. All the outfits here are really pretty You cannot find these types of outfits at a low cost anywhere. You can also check your sizes on the app if u are quiet worried about fitting. Really! It's the best app I will suggest to shop from shein only.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,Number 1 online shopping experience. Just have not received all of my shopping. To no fault of Shein...that was due to South Africa's end of the deal. That makes me hesitant for future shopping. I have all the evidence of my fully paid taxes....but still I sadly lost my packages.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It is effecient and cheap. Some of the goods are of high quality as dipicted on the app. But sometimes what the app shows is different from the actual goods one received which is disappointing... The app has to show the real size, type of material of the product all the time. The excellent part of the shein app is the delivery of goods. One is informed about the transportation schedules and where the product is until it is delivered to the customer... The best app in that regard. I love the app."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have been pleasantly surprised by the items I have bought from Shein, the sizing has been good, the designs are so varied and flattering. There's something for everyone. I have definitely been converted to a regular Shein user now."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein App is user-friendly, they have great fashion and accessories, not to mention the sales and coupons. I am very comfortable shopping at Shein, they make shopping easy, their return policy and procedure are very easy with less stress in comparison to other competitors."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Love it, great prices, ordered loads from here 99% of it is fantastic been the odd item thats not what i thought it would look like, but just send it back and get refund. Love this site and think you can grab some good bargains."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have been so thrilled to find SheIn ! Being plus size,but not too big, however very short, has always been a huge problem. I love their quality fabrics & styles. I buy all my Doggie clothes from this site too, which are gorgeous and at a quarter of the store prices. Returns are easy !"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love Shein. I love how you can read the reviews and what I love the most is the fact that people can leave picture reviews. Being able to see a item on different body types, different sizes and that people put their measurements. That is what makes me purchase items. The things that I have mostly ordered have been because of picture reviews. If I t doesn't have pictures in the reviews I usually won't order it."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love love love shein their things are affordable from their assortment of accessories. Down to their dressy, casual, and sporty clothing . I can always find something nice for any occasion. Shein also has sizes for everyone from xs to 5x. They're a must try and I give them⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I absolutely love Shein. I order dresses, blouses, t-shirts, sweaters, sweatshirts, swimsuits and shoes and have been pleased with all my purchases!! The price is perfect. The clothing and shoes are perfect. Once you try Shein you will be hooked just like me!!!!!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,This app used to be my go-to shopping app. I had a wishlist ready for when I got paid. But recently I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app so many times and the same issue keeps occuring. The app just crashes 5 seconds in.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Shein is my all time favorite online shopping app! I am plus sized so it's hard for me to shop in stores for actually cute clothes at a reasonable price. Shein is a complete game changer with all the cute clothes for great prices and the little gadgets they that such as an eye lash curler with a built in brush... it does WONDERS
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I would give it a 5 start but for the free trial I never get picked EVER Ive baught so much stuff and never get anything for free like it says I can yeah the clothes are cheap most the time but the really cute ones are expensive a lot of the time I love the app but I barely make any points even off reviews
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Very good range in clothing items. Sizing is alright most of the time. The shipping is pretty on time and reliable. The materials are sometimes a bit bizarre but overall quite alright
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"first off let me say your clothing is amazing I had seen it before I had even ordered some items myself. Went to my cousin's house I seen all of the outfits for her and her daughter and she told me that ship and came within a week, that itself is impressive to me. I downloaded the app seen some things I liked the cost was reasonable.. I am glad she introduced this site to me.. I am loving it!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein is excellent for shopping on-line, the variety is endless. Quality is very good, value for money & true to size. I love the pjs & jumpsuits, which I have few. The only thing I will say is, delivery isn't quick! But worth waiting for! Returns are quick & easy to do."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The delivery is so fast considering how cheap shipping is. I've ordered many times from here and I can get many outfits out of as little as £100. Such cute clothing and for the price it's amazing quality, too! Forget brands, you can look even cuter in these clothes ❤🤞🏼 Highly recommend."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"The shop itself is pretty good over all, but im having some trouble with the sizing in the clothes. Not just that but the shipping costs more than the actual item itself and takes way too long."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"My 12 year old granddaughter loves all the great clothes and jewelry Shein has to offer. So far she has picked out $20 of jewelry, about 6 pieces. Necklaces and brackets. Loves them and wears them. Sweat pants, t shirt, jacket and a set of sweatpants and long sleeve shirt and iphone case and that was around $48. Shipping is $3.99 or you can pay for faster shipping if you like too. Regular comes in, in about 10 days. I love the fact, as a middle schooler, she always looks great."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,I am interested in the products but I had to uninstall the app due to the ridiculous amount of ads. It practically took over my phone. Absolutely absurd. I couldn't even look at the items without an ad.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I deleted my account because after a year of using it I figured out it's not worth it , the quality of most clothes is so bad and alot of them are so thin , the prices may look cheap but u will understand after a while that it's not worth it. Also most clothes that looks decent they're expensive , and paying system is quite tricky with the prices the shipping and the vouchers u may think u re winning but figured out better get Ur clothes from a quality shop .."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,My overall experience has been great. Lots of choices at great prices. I truly love shopping and I have recommended this site to my friends who are now becoming junkies 😁 My only issue is my account is not sinkroniz with my cell and computer. And it's the same account Also on my laptop it doesn't allow me to change my shipping address like I use to but I can do it from my phone And as a result my I lost my daily points. This will continue to be my first choice for shopping as always. Great love
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Super easy to use. Just check your measurements and check reviews on items. Great quality clothing. Easy and efficient payment. Great communication with regards to shipping details. Would highly recommend to all!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,App is great but customer service and tracking is a little funky. I like the style of clothing and pricing is reasonable. The delivery guarantee doesn't really work how it is supposed to.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Best shopping site. Easy to navigate and they have tons of clothes and accessories to offer. All buys are value for money because everything you buy is at cheaper rate as compared to buying from physical store. Always have discounts and vouchers to offer. Recommended for all .
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"There is so many reviews with photos so you can see if the product is good or not. But shein is also a very good app because we have so many choices and it is not expensive at all. For all the order that I did, I have never been disappointed and I hope that it will continue for the future."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app consists of very nice and affordable products, reasonable quality (depends on the price), with great deals and discounts. The only downfall is that it takes time for them to deliver, also expect to be taxed by your country."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Don't use this app...This app was very good ....l ordered some hoodies from this app and it's not fitting me... it's too over sized and also very big ... You hardly pick it up from here ... I don't know what to do, plz it's always showing pick up from your area is not possible... So you tell me how I return.. I can't myself travel to haryana to return such thing... it's too disgusting my money got wasted"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"We ordered 48 items, we ended up receiving 35. I contacted the customer service via tickets (please do not reply with open a ticket because you suck), they ended up saying ""after monitoring and verifying that the order is not missing"" and they'll refund me either with my shein wallet (which I'm surely not gonna use anymore) or my account. With 13 missing items, I guess one deserves his items back with a gift, but hey, these are the respectful companies. Waiting for my money to be back."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good prices, decent quality, but pretty lengthy shipping time. Occasionally can have products that ship something random with the product, or smaller than was advertised. Not bad for cheap prices though so 4/5."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I have had great experiences so far! Measure yourself and use the size charts. Read the reviews on the garments etc for additional help. Shipping is almost always faster than the anticipated date. Prices are outstanding.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love that the reviews are incentive based. Meaning they are pretty much always honest and accurate. When height and weight are noted with pictures from other customers it makes it a lot easier to compare your own body type. Quality are price are on point.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"A friend if mine told me about this app and...honestly, I was a bit skeptical at first. I went ahead and downloaded it. Never believed I would find the items at the prices, with purchaser's recommendations, that I have located...I refer all my friends to this app and I will continue to be a loyal follower!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Everything I have ordered from SHEIN has come in a timely manner. The quality is excellent and the fit has been perfect. I read the reviews regularly and they influence the size and article I order. I love SHEIN.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Tons of great choices. I just wish you could enter your measurements and it would only pull up those clothes that fit your body versus looking through every piece of clothing.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Shein always exceeds my expectations! The app is so easy to use, groups similar items together and suggests similar items when the one you want is not available. The refund system is so easy and the return button is so easy to find and your orders."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"DO NOT USE THIS APP I used this app to order some clothing (my 3rd order from this app) when I noticed some odd transactions on my card. I went to my bank after it started escalating, but I had already been hacked and this was the only app I had used the card for around this time. It was traced back to this app. Sure I got some clothes, but it almost cost my saving."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Most of the items are worthy, unique,new design and colors, nice, very interesting and satisfy, love them a lot💞..bought them via my daughter(Amanina) orders👍keep it up!.. with more new items, design, colors and size to fit💖 and...more coupons or points to help my daughter for her savings🤗🤭😅😁😊lots of supports, fightiiiing.."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"So far I've had a good experience with their products. Not everything is as I expected, but a majority of them are. 1 out of 5 things I end up not using. For example, I ordered 3 swimsuits and one of them was too flimsy and small, but the other 2 were perfect 🤷‍♀️"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"i ordered over 15 items from their shop. i love their clothes + other stuff and its A GOOD PRICE. i got about 10 clothings and some shoes and a bag and i ended up spending only about $100 with FREE shipping. bro, i looked at over 20 online stores and i feel like SHEIN clothes are unmatched. i also love how the orders come earlier than the estimated delivery time. the quality of the clothes are pretty good so far! genuinely, SHEIN is my favorite clothes shop right now. STREAM BUTTER🧈 BY BTS"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,It's great app. The shipping does take awhile but they have nice clothes. Their return policy is also amazing. If there is a problem with the fit or style they will pay for shipping and give you a refund.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Good app.! Very helpful for me and my family. Good variety of clothes, accessories and a lot more. Good customer service as well. I really enjoy shopping,very hassle free, convenient plus very affordable. Thank you so much shein! 😉😊"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love the outfits, they have the stylesi like with sizes that fit, aren't too pricy and are cheaper than what you'd find on Amazon or eBay. Love it ❤❤ I have bought so many outfits on shein and they are so comfortable, and the makeup is clean and smooth, I got some eyeliner and it lasted forever even when I rubbed my eyes, it's so lightweight and not smudgy either, this app is beautiful!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I've never had an issue so far. Items arrive before ETA. I am careful with purchasing by sizes. Quality is good, affordable. The most important the excellent variety they have for plus sizers, lingerie a 10 star."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I love shein 🥰 I can never just go on the website and order just a couple pieces of clothing or shoes!! You can go wrong with shein. Some of the clothes are really good quality I wish I could give more then 5 stars. I highly recommend
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I love the clothes and accessories. They are so cute and affordable. The only con I have is that, please, not every cute top has to be cropped. I am not one to show lots of skin but each and every top is a crop. I even go to the regular tshirts and they are cropped too. My belly gets cold you know, does yours not get cold?"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Until today I really liked SHEIN. I'm new but already placed several orders & was mostly pleased with everything. Learning how the sizes run & loved the shoes I bought & most of the clothes. Then today it all changed.. I doubt I'll buy anything else fm them again. I ordered a rug & seems like FedEx lost it. My return also vanished tho I used label provided by SHEIN. I needed live assistance! But you CANNOT find live help. Just a chat that asks for $10 before you cant even get that! I'm done!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,The products are fancy and eye catching but the quality is cheap I bought the similar designs as in shein from h&m and the quality difference was huge. The minor details like zip Pockets have been compromised and not that the products are very cheap
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I have found only amazing things from my Shein experience. Shipping time is quick, and as long as I measure and read the description of each item I have had no surprises or disappoinments. My only complaint is that there are so many great things to buy that I will be broke if I don't restrain myself. 😂"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"ive been using SHEIN twice and I am very satisfied with their service, prices, quality, description, designs, points and overall very recommended. most of my customers no complaint about their products. keep it up SHEIN.. recently, SHEIN don't deliver to our region, so sad..refund process very fast, support team very friendly.."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This site has one of the worst customer support services i'ev ever came across. I had ordered a prepaid product for a month now and it still hasn't been delivered. And when we try to contact customer support, there is this some kinda bot which repeatedly sends the same idiotic message over and over again. When we call they never answer the phone. Pathetic. Waste of money as well as time."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Terrible customer service! In the beggining it was everything good, but lately on two orders I made they didn't send me one item on each of them, I submited a ticket and they marked the problem as solved even tho there isn't a real solved answer to the problem. Turning into thiefs slowly but surely!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Love Shein it is so addictive! You can get some really nice clothes that don't cost a fortune. You need to check the reviews to make sure the clothing is good quality and true to size. You earn points by reviewing the clothing you buy and checking in every day. Only downside is waiting for delivery which says 2-3 weeks but it usually arrives by about 1 week so not too bad really!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Great experience, they became super fast and also the customer support is very reactive. The product are also mostly good quality and you have such a high offer ☺️. Don't be afraid to try it out!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"great app, cheap items at times, but can break easily. lots of choice of many things, including clothing, accessories and homeware. i also like the shein free trial zone!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Overall the services I've received this far has been outstanding. Everything I've ordered came before expected arrival date, packaged very nicely, with affordable prices, & payment options. SHEIN is by far one of the best if not the best online shopping experience I've had since I started shopping online in 2020."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I would give it 4 stars because sometimes the items are very low quality, but mostly it's all very wonderful. I really do like the stuff that shein has but sometimes I just wish that they could add sanrio decorations or just custom things."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Everything's great except the sizes are kinda off and the points I collect keep expiring even the ones from the daily check in not from the mini games so I just stopped collecting the points daily other than those 2 things it's a great app for great prices!
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"I've had a few hiccups with Shein lately. I had two orders go missing, never received. I don't like that you can't actually talk to anyone about a missing order... it's a chatbot that never fully addresses your issue and goes round and round with the same answer. Live customer service is needed if you want loyal customers. I don't know that I'll spend more money here because I'm not confident I'll get my items."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Everything I've ordered was the perfect size and of good quality. Shipping and communication on point. I'll definitely continue purchasing from them. App is easy to use as well👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,My package was late without notification. When they did try to deliver my package they said no one was home while I was there the entire day. No one was there from any delivery company And now I can not get hold of the courier company to reschedule delivery. This is absolutely poor service and I feel like I'm never going to receive my parcel as Buffalo Logistics is absolutely useless.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"The app is easy to use. So far, I've liked the stuff I've gotten. They matched the pictures and descriptions. A lot of styles are quite unique that you can't easily find in the US or Amazon."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I have used this app for a while now, and my whole closet is filled with clothes from Shein. Unfortunately till now, I had one very miserable order ~ example I ordered A, but they delivered me D; yet I am being charged for a return postage?? Yet I could not get hold of anyone to feedback on this error, hence using this platform!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I just love this app, I only shop here now, it has EVERYTHING and there's always a sale or price reduction, which it has alerts for. There's every single size, products are good quality, the shipping is relatively fast. I can't ask for more."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Loads of great products. One of the best shopping experiences I've had online. I love their filters to be able to find exactly what you want. They seem to work much better than most other apps and even search engines.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"This app is amazing, trendy stuff for very affordable price however i must let the developers know that the new decoratives, the colors and everything in the app really doesn't look trustworthy or reliable, if i wasn't someone using the app before, i wouldn't get anything from there just by looking at the flashy page! the simpler the better."
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Lovely clothes all with individual size charts which is brilliant ! Loads of different styles to choose from , Easy to follow, easy to order , easy payment and tracking of parcels . Become one of my favorite sites to shop on ! Cannot fault SHEIN"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I like this app the clothes fit well and are good quality for the price always lots of discounts what I actually don't like is that I find it really hard to contact them when there is a problem but on the whole a really good experience and nice clothes for all sizes at the end of it .
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,This is definitely my go to shopping app for affordable clothes and accessories! It's easy to use and has great offers and a points system for additional discounts. The products are also pretty good for the price.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,Very reasonable price and good quality. Great deals all the time. When you rate your purchase more point can be converted to money discount. Love to shop all the time.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,I was skeptical at first too because I tried other places online but shein I actually do really like their clothing. you just have to look at people's reviews click on the pictures zoom in read the fabric of the material and you should be good I absolutely love getting their deals and their flash sales and they have games on there to earn points and just for sign in you get money points too go towards your orders I think it's a good site And free shipping to 👍😊thxs
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"I love this app!! I usually don't download apps like these but for someone who just loves clothes and fashion, this is an ultimate exception!! 😊 I love how there's little contests to make outfit collages, it's so fun, I don't even do it for the points!!"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,The app has been extremely easy to use. On the quality of the clothing received. READ the reviews and look at pictures.. Everything is affordable and ships fast.
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I would give it more stars because the prices and shipping are amazing! But it says it can't ship to p.o boxs?? Its very disappointing because I just started shopping and found almost everything I need for Christmas, but I can't get it, please help me if you can"
"March 22, 2024",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"The app has some of the best fashio stuff with the best prices ever. But the only problem I have is customer care service and delivery of customer orders. I made an order over one month ago and until today I haven't received it yet, despite it being shipped a couple of days after placing the order. The package arrived in Qatar over one week ago, but I'm not seeing any signs of receiving it any soon. I have tried to contact customer care agents to no avail. Only the stupid answers from auto bot"
