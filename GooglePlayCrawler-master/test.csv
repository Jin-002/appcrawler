2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,Love this app but I one thing I hate is that some features aren't available for everyone. I have tried everything to get photo mode to work and no matter what I do it's not available for me. It's available for friends in my area and every creator I follow. It's really frustrating because I'm a content creator myself and would like the opportunity to utilize these posts! There is no technical support either which is extremely frustrating
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Alright, I don't know if the ads you get are personalized, so this could be some past that I can't remember coming around now, but I keep getting ads of dating apps that are very suggestive and show women with very clear features ig is the only way i can think of describing it. But this is super weird to me, I just swipe away immediately and they come back after one or two different ads. Its super annoying, but the app itself is fine, i just don't know where else to post this problem."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Would rate higher...but what the heck is up with this throwing my text around and everything I've edited to be precise, only to have it look like trash and make zero sense. It looks good, then when going to publish, throws text and overlays all over the place, off screen, etc. Is this a push to get me to delete the app? Cause I'm about at that point. Not the first time, but definitely getting worse."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Good app and all EXCEPT how some different device types have more features. The one thing that I want is to be able to post a photo in a comment. I have a Google pixel and I'm not sure which type of phone (I'm pretty sure it's apple) that can post pictures in the comments but I would like that on every phone type. Overall, its a pretty good app. Would recommend if your fine with a few less features then others"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"For 2 months, I have not received notifications from the creators I have selected to get all notifications from. All my settings for notifications are set properly. Nothing has been turned off. I uninstalled and reinstalled with no change to receiving notification. Submitted screen shots to tiktok help, only for them to ask for more screen shots of the same pics I already submitted. Is anyone else having this problem?"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've had tiktok for pretty long, but recently there was another update (which is normal).tik Tok had updated the generated captions which is actually really great! But not for me, I don't like the captions on my screen blocking most of the video . I know how to take the captions off but even if I turn the setting off, the captions will still show up. The is very annoying, hope they fix the problem soon:)"
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"<The best feature I like most in TikTok is ""Use this/any template"", and I can easily edit videos with just 1 click and it's a great way to spend my free time. It includes all kinds of good content including art videos, templates, videography, photography, etc., where I can get all the benefits of the facility of uploading videos and tutorials of I also speak my voice poetry. Thank you:)"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"One of the worst apps I've ever used. I'm late to the party but who cares. The app crashes multiple times, logs me out, can't log in and so many features that it'll take me a year to figure it out. If that is I can ever get in. It keeps me logged in for like a day before kicking me out and then I can't get back in. I'm trying to promote a business here on the most popular app and I can't. I have to uninstall it and then reinstall to get in."

2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"Very addicting, easy to use, rich in preference settings. The only thing I have a problem with is the organization of comment replies, everything is jumbled up and people miss corrections (due to the inability to edit comments) because it's mixed in with all the other replies. I would suggest a cleaner way to organize replies and comments, possibly a thread like structure for replies under replies. In order to avoid the comment section looking like a program script, I would also add collapsing."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I love to waste time on this app, but recent updates have made it so hard to navigate on a Galaxy ZFold 4. (tablet mode specifically) I go to check comments and it pulls half the video off screen. When I try to go back to the video, I now can only see half of it. And the comment section disappears completely and I'm left with half a video and a black bar for any other video I try to watch. Please fix ðŸ˜«"
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"after a while of using it, the app will crash whenever I try to open it. clearing cache or app data does not solve the issue, I have stable internet, enough storage on my device and the app is up to date. the first time this happened, I had to delete and reinstall the app, losing all my drafts i had saved. It's happened again."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This is getting less and less optimized for my Z Fold 3. About a year ago, it was absolutely fine. About six months ago, after an update, the comment section was only visible with a quarter of what it should be. Now the most recent update gives me a black screen, sometimes cuts the used space of the video in half and the other half being black, sometimes does that except cuts the actual video in half. Even more irritating is when it works for the first couple, then goes into one of those bugs."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"Edit: it's been a few weeks since I've had this problem so I thought I should edit this to let people know about that. Now this is 5 â­?The app keeps crashing when I click it. The only solution I have left is to redownload it everyday sometimes twice a day. (I've cleared cache, cleared phone from random data, did everything various websites mentioned.) The logo screen appears then swipes itself to the right. Edit to add: it's been doing this for a few months now and it's slowly getting worse."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I usually love the app and love being on it, but in the new update, there's ""transitions"" when you go from screen to screen and when you start recording a video and discard it, the whole damn screen spins for a few seconds. It is the most inconvenient thing and it gives me such a headache. Theres no option to turn it off either. Its keeping me off the app as of right now thats for sure."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's an okay app, but I continually have issues with the favorites page. It stops scrolling down after a while, and things often don't favorite to the right folder when I put them there. I've reset my phone and reinstalled the app, and yet it still keeps happening. It's really annoying to have to favorite the video 60 times for it to work because of the feature that notifys the creator when you favorite it. Either than this constant problem, It's a well working app and it's nicely developed."
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I hate the fact that you updated the way videos are put into a playlist and the most recent are at the bottom now. Could you change it back to where the most recent are at the top ? Also I don't know if it's just the server but I'm trying to use the search function and it is so glitchy and laggy to the point it flat out just freezes before the video appears playing music where I'm having to exit the whole app because it gets so Frozen and stuck.
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Good app, great time killer. I wish it didn't save content to my default camera folder. The same folder I use for taking photos with the default camera app. This creates tons of confusion and wasted time trying to find my actual photos, it'd be more convenient if it made it's own folder labeled ""TikTok"" or something, just not the default camera folder. Will add the 3 missing stars for that feature, until then I'm turning off the ability to save content to my device as a result"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The algorithm in this app is broken. I keep getting recommended asmr and mukbang videos even though I hate that stuff with a burning passion. I've tried just scrolling, I've tried pressing the ""not interested"" button (which never works), and I've even tried blocking the accounts, but nothing works. Tiktok, please for the love of God fox your algorithm to where it permenantly never shows you stuff you don't want to see, it would save me and a lot of other people from being thrown into a spiral."
2024/3/22,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"However, there are some missing features that I feel would enhance the user experience. Firstly, it would be great to have a modern trending page within the 'songs' section, showcasing the top trending songs of the day. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include regional soundtracks by official artists to avoid the upload of copyrighted material. Lastly, users should be able to use 15-second clips of any sound within their TikTok videos, similar to how Instagram Reels allow for longer clip"
2024/3/22,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"It's a great app to explore but I just needed to tell everyone reading this that IT IS NOT FOR KIDS,there are multiple slideshows that have inappropriate images (ðŸŒ½ with a p), I also noticed that your have different features on different accounts, for example,on one account I can't make slideshows but on another,I can, I find it very unfair and unreasonable,but so far I haven't had any other issues with this app."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Honestly deserves 1 star. I've been dealing with this issue over the past two years and l've reported it previously but you guys never fix this issue for me. I try looking at filters and I try to enjoy the filters that I see in my for you page but it never gives me the option to even see them. My friends and other people are able to see these filters and use them but in my case they don't show up on my end. Please fix this issue for me it's been far too long for this continue happening.
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Tiktok has been having this issue for awhile where it doesn't open and sits on one page for 10 minutes and still does nothing. Or just doesn't open at all. Now after being redownloaded, it's reverted back to before all the updates when it was first released, and once the app is closed, it doesn't load and I have to uninstall and reinstall again only for it to be of unupdated and showing there are none needed. Please fix this."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Hard to Find Stuff: Sometimes, it's tough to find what you want on TikTok. There are so many videos, and it can be tricky to locate specific ones. Also, the Explore page doesn't always show things you're interested in. Same Stuff Over and Over: TikTok sometimes shows the same kinds of videos a lot. This might not be so good if you want to see different things and explore new content."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I have an Android phone and the app randomly crashes. This is the 3rd time it's happened. When I open the app and it flashes the black TikTok screen and closes. I tried to clear cache, restart my phone and once I had even waited upto 2 weeks, but nothing worked. It seems like there was an update on 11/03/2024 and today (12/03/2024) my app decides to crash. TikTok need to be more user friendly to Android users (Huawei p30). I've lost so many drafts and memorable videos that I'll never get back."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"Fine app. I use it a lot. One thing they to change. Please add a scroll feature! So many liked tiktoks I'm never gonna see again because there all the way at the bottom of the liked page. Or if that doesn't work, make it that you can search tiktoks or search a specific date that when you liked it.I don't know if you could make it work but if you can please add it!"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've never had problems with this app before. Last week it stopped working. I have tried everything. Uninstalling it, restarting my phone, logging in and out, cleared the cache... Nothing works. It's just a black screen when I open it and says I'm not connected to a network even though I have data and wifi and all my other apps work.. I can see a few videos on my for you page but can't login to my account and it won't load more videos.. I'm pretty frustrated."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Used to be a good app, but then the updates screwed it over. They got rid of their dark mode for Android, making it difficult for people with visual issues to see the screen from the HARSH white mode, they messed the comments up, and the pre-post to posted editing ratio is all messed up. Ex: I edit and upload a video thinking all of my text is in the frame when it isn't and half of it isn't legible from it being blurred or cut out. Used to be good, got worse."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The TikTok experience has become increasingly frustrating. I deleted and reinstalled the app hoping to fix the editing issue, only to encounter more problems â€?no 2x feature, still unable to edit, and reposting is no longer possible. It's disappointing for both viewers and creators. Please address these issues. I can't believe I risked all my drafts for a complete downgrade. ðŸ™„"
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"TikTok has many amazing creators but quite the horendous format in which they are displayed. I deleted the app many months ago for the same reason I am writing this review today. TikTok will not let you mute videos unless you pause them. There is a setting that has videos muted upon first opening the app, but you can't play any other audio on your phone. Once you unmute the videos, you can't undo the action. Please add a mute button. It is the bare minimum, and please, let us play our own music."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"The app isn't well formatted for all types of phones such as the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold3. When I am trying to see videos on the inside screen, some of the videos will only show on half of the screen, and opening the comments will do this to videos that are displayed normally. This issue cuts off a chunk of the video as well. They need to look into this to make it work better for more than just the average iPhone or Galaxy phones."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There's definitely been some issues with the app freezing my phone screen. Just did a restart and now I can't see any of my notifications within the app. I tried to report this to the help desk, after I tried all the recommended ways to fix the issue (which didn't work) and all I get is the ""something went wrong try again"". So, I get notifications but can't actually view comments, likes, etc."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I don't know what's going on but the app is messed up today. It was fine until a few hours ago and now it either won't load a draft, or when I try to post it, it kicks me back to the drafts screen. It's showing me old notifications. I force quit the app, it asked me in app to quit it so I did. I had to log back in, same issue even after restarting my phone. I'm don't want to try uninstalling and reinstalling because I'll lose drafts. Fix plsss"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The newest update feels so unnecessary. The interface feels clunky and whenever I'm trying to repost something it instead shows me a big list of my friends that covers up half of my screen. No one asked for that, the previous interface was great already! Same with the video sliding up when going inti the comments. It's not as annoying but I think most people dislike it based in what I've seen people in the app itself say. Overall, the newest update feels very unnecessary."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Now app completely loads different pages wonky, like weird sliding effect. What is that supposed to do, other than be infuriatingly excessive! Still has a lot of flaws. App can be highly unstable at times; freezing, lost connection when there is plenty of service, no Dark Mode for Android when there is supposed to be, etc."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"So I love TikTok it's a great app but recently there was an update and now the screen spins when I push tabs in the tiktok shop?! Uhm absolutely not the screen shifts when I click into my profile as well as individual chats. Edit: So turns out tiktok added ""transitions"" to the tiktok actions and there is no way to turn it off it's absolutely horrible it hurts my eyes."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"Recently bought the Galaxy Z Fold 5, and this app struggles while the phone is unfolded. At times, videos get shifted off the screen to where you only get to see half of it. If the video opens correctly and you open the comments, this can shift the video off screen and never return when closing the comments. Additionally, if you accidentally click to recharge your coins, the only way to get out is to close the app."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This app has a lot of flaws, so please listen up. Everytime I press the dislike button on a video that I don't like or I'm not interested in, those videos still pop up. And when I press the dislike button on an ad that's useless to me or something I don't like, it doesn't work. And Tiktokers are constantly uploading offensive videos and videos that aren't supposed to be on this app, I report every single time and those videos still show up. I'm not sure if it's a bug or not, but please fix it."
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"It's a good app but it has flaws. For me, the app keeps freezing and going mute. It also freezes my whole phone. If I try to leave the app, I have to power off my phone before going on anything else sometimes. And it lags so much. It might be my phone, though, I really don't know. Make it work for other phones, not just iPhones. The app can't function unless it's the only thing on my phone. It needs to be fixed. It's taking over my phone like a virus. Also, too many ads and pop-ups. Fix it."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Lately it's impossible to upload videos. It constantly crashes, freezes, I've lost my drafts and now it literally can't load ANY video I have ""Sorry, something went wrong"" literally all the time. Also the ""not interested"" feature is hidden? And the app keeps on showing me stuff I couldn't care less about or that goes against my beliefs and interests"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"recent bug is that a lot of time I will tap on the app on my home screen and it just refuses to open, it will make the animation that its opening but then only flash a white screen and immediately close. this does not happen with my other apps. Sometimes I have to restart my phone just to get it to open once. Other than that on my android phone making tiktoks is completely impossible and the app kept crashing so I just gave up and only watch. Otherwise, I do enjoy the app.good apps tnx tik tok"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"I've been getting so many spammers as well as spyware. That has come from this app. I. Also, I don't understand why this app does not function correctly for me. I have the latest updated version, space, ect, but for whatever reason, it does not post my videos if they're over 3 minutes, and it also does not save to my drafts. So, all the effort I put into editing my videos. TikTok just throws my effort down the drain. If it does not improve these issues I will be deleting my account"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"So after a very long time the major problems like the certain fixed elements within the application, such as the prominently bright ""For You"" letters at the top and the plus icon at the bottom that where contributing to screen burn issues on phones where kinda fixed by opening the comments those elements go away and you can enjoy the videos in peace without worrying about your phones screen. Still, the lack of a dark themed mode in the app is unexceptable in the year 2024."
2024/3/22,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"don't get me wrong, I've had tiktok for over 4 years now, and its great! I just absolutely hate that they keep getting rid of helpful things, like comments on reposts, pinning comments, etc. I also hate that you can't search up slideshows. Its really unhelpful. Ive tried to search certain ones up multiple times, and all i get is videos of people screen recording them, and over time it got really annoying. please add/fix this."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Recent bug is that a lot of time I will tap on the app on my home screen and it just refuses to open,it will make the animation that it's opening but then only flash a white screen and immediately close this does not happen with my other apps sometime I have to restart my phone just to get it to open once.other than that on my android phone making tiktks is completely impossible and the app kept crashing so I just gave up and.only watch Otherwise,I do enjoy the app . good app @mandialy0"
2024/3/22,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"I don't know what's happening with TikTok but I'm scrolling through videos like any other day and suddenly the video that is supposed to be showing goes all black and the only thing that goes on it's the audio playing in the background it happens over and over again. I know it isn't my wifi cause I have a very stable connection, I tried uninstalling the app then reinstalling it again but it's the same thing, nothing changes. It's very disappointing because I enjoyed this app a lot until now."
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,8 months ago my TikTok started loosing major features... the ability to edit.. use filters... use sounds... etc. Several friends have had similar experiences. No matter how many times we have written & requested help from TikTok...none of us have heard back. We have all tried to erase & redownload many times. Some friends have left the app now & I have barely any basic features left. I suspect that TikTok is made for iPhones and anyone with a less common phone gets issue after issue.
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Don't know what's going on, but I can not see the comment section. All I get is black screen, and I can only see half videos. Some videos are cut in half (screen not length), and finally I'm seeing the same videos over and over again. This started happening after an update. It worked perfectly before. SAMSUNG GALAXY FOLD 4"
2024/3/22,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"It is annoying, I'd open the app and they'd just show the black screen, and for the next 5 minutes, it's still loading, I can't use it to do ANYTHING.. It's just taking up space. I updated it, hoping that would change something, it didnt, I'm updating it again. Nothing changes? I'm done I officially hate this app, just used over 100mb updating it for nothing to change... Uninstalled"
